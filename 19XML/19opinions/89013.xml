&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;DECATUR BANK&lt;br&gt;
v.&lt;br&gt;
ST. LOUIS BANK.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*297&lt;/span&gt; Mr. J.B. Hawley, for the plaintiff in error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. F.W. Jones, contra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*298&lt;/span&gt; Mr. Justice DAVIS delivered the opinion of the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basis of this suit is the letter of credit of 13th September, 1869. The subsequent correspondence, on any rational interpretation of it, did not have the effect to change the terms of this the original letter, nor was it intended to do so except in two particulars, which are not the subject of controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defence now made, technical though it be, is sufficient to defeat the action if the condition of the guarantee was not observed, and this fact renders necessary a construction of the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all other contracts it must receive the construction which is most probable and natural under the circumstances, so as to attain the object which the parties to it had in contemplation in making it. Frederick was engaged in buying and shipping stock in St. Louis during the fall and winter of 1869, and the presumption is, in the absence of any evidence on the point, that he resided in Decatur, where the plaintiff in error had its place of business. At any rate, he was unknown in St. Louis, without either money or credit, and, as he could not carry on his business without money, it was necessary that he should be accredited to some responsible &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*299&lt;/span&gt; banking house in that city. This was done through the letter of credit of 13th September. The bank to which this letter was addressed doubtless thought its correspondent trusted in some degree to the pecuniary responsibility of Frederick, but it had no right to suppose that the letter of credit was given solely on this account. On the contrary, the letter is based on the idea that shipments of stock would protect the drafts. If Frederick was responsible, still the Decatur bank did not trust to this alone, but relied on the security which was to accompany the drafts. This it had a right to do, and its conduct was very natural under the circumstances. Indeed, the business in which Frederick was engaged is usually conducted in this manner. The Decatur bank doubtless believed, and acted on the belief, that the stock would sell for enough to pay the drafts, and if it did not, the loss would be inconsiderable and such as Frederick could readily meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It now seeks to escape liability, not on the ground that stock sufficient to secure the drafts was not shipped, but that it was a different sort of stock from that named in its letter. It is fair to presume that an investment in hogs yielded as good a return as an investment in cattle, and if the consignee in Chicago had not failed, that no trouble would have arisen. As this consignee, named by it, and with whom the St. Louis bank had no concern, did fail, it seeks to throw the loss on the St. Louis bank because it interpreted the letter to embrace shipments of hogs as well as neat cattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question then arises, was this interpretation correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That stock of some kind formed part of the guarantee is quite plain, but is the word "cattle" in this connection to be confined to neat cattle alone, that is, cattle of the bovine genus? It is often so applied, but it is "also a collective name for domestic quadrupeds generally, including not only the bovine tribe, but horses, asses, mules, sheep, goats, and swine."&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; In its limited sense it is used to designate the different varieties of horned animals, but it is also frequently &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*300&lt;/span&gt; used with a broader signification as embracing animals in general which serve as food for man. In England, even in a criminal case, where there is a greater strictness of construction than in a civil controversy, pigs were held to be included within the words "any cattle."&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt; And in other cases in that country involving life and liberty the word has been construed so as to embrace animals not used for food.&lt;sup&gt;[&#x86;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did the Decatur bank use the word in its narrow and restricted meaning or in its more enlarged and general sense? In other words, did it intend to restrict Frederick to the dealing in horned animals alone, and so confine the defendant in error to drafts based on this kind of stock? There was no apparent motive for doing so. Clearly, security was the object to be attained, and this was better attained by leaving Frederick unrestricted in the choice of animals to send forward to market, provided they were of the kind generally used for food. It is well known that the market varies at the Chicago cattle-yards. At certain times hogs have a readier sale and bring better prices than other kinds of stock, and at other times horned animals alone command the attention of buyers. Every prudent dealer in stock informs himself of the state of the market before purchasing, and the means of doing this are greatly multiplied in later years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Frederick pursued this course, and bought and sold according to the indications of the Chicago market, would seem clear from the evidence, for he says he was engaged in buying and shipping stock in St. Louis during the fall and winter of 1869. If his operations, except in the single instance on which the drafts in suit are based, were confined to horned stock, why did he not say so? If true, it would have strengthened the defence, because it would have shown that all the dealings between Frederick and the defendant in error, with a single exception, were based on shipments of stock of the bovine genus. These dealings were continued &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*301&lt;/span&gt; through a period of three months by the renewals of the guarantee, and could not have been infrequent. It would seem, therefore, that the parties in St. Louis dealt with each other on the understanding that the guarantee embraced the different kinds of stock which are used for food, and usually sent for that purpose to the Chicago market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had the right to give this construction to it, and there is nothing in the evidence tending to show that the plaintiff in error understood it differently, except that the word "cattle," as often used, does not include hogs. But it would be a narrow rule to hold that this word was used in its restricted sense, in the absence of any evidence, other than inferential, on the subject. Especially is this so when the word is susceptible of a different meaning, and important transactions have been based on the idea that it was employed in its enlarged and not in its restricted sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This construction of the letter of credit disposes of the case and affirms the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true, the judge of the Circuit Court instructed the jury that the letter of September 21st, which leaves out the terms "on shipments of cattle," constituted the contract of guarantee between the plaintiff and defendant, but the result would have been the same if he had charged the jury, as we are of the opinion that he should have done, that the rights of the parties were to be determined by the terms of the original letter of credit of the 13th September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either aspect of the case the judgment must have been for the plaintiff below, and to warrant the reversal of a judgment there must be not only error found in the record, but the error must be such as may have worked injury to the party complaining.&lt;sup&gt;[*]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill of exceptions contains all the evidence in the case, and though the jury may have found their verdict on a wrong theory of the case, yet as the court can see that the verdict was correct, the plaintiff in error is not harmed by the misdirection of the judge. The result is right, although the manner of reaching it may have been wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*302&lt;/span&gt; It was urged at the bar that National banks are not authorized to issue letters of credit, and if so, that the action cannot be sustained. But the record does not raise the question, and it cannot, therefore, be considered. It is true a plea was interposed which was doubtless meant to raise it, on which, issue to the country was tendered, but for aught that appears it was abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No evidence was offered under it, but if this were not necessary the attention of the court at least should have been called to it, and proper instructions asked. If refused, error could have been assigned, and the point would then have been properly before the court for decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing of the kind was done, and it is too late to raise the question now.&lt;/p&gt;
