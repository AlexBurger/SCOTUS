&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;109 U.S. 63 (1883)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;UNITED STATES&lt;br&gt;
v.&lt;br&gt;
HAMILTON.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Submitted October Term, 1882.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided October 15th, 1883.&lt;/center&gt;
ON CERTIFICATE OF DIVISION IN OPINION BETWEEN THE JUDGES OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE.
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The certificate of division in this case was made on a division in opinion between the judges on a motion to quash the indictment. As a motion to quash is always addressed to the discretion of the court, a decision upon it is not error, and cannot be reviewed on a writ of error. In the case of &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Rosenburgh,&lt;/i&gt; 7 Wall. 580, we decided the precise point, that this court cannot take cognizance of a division of opinion between the judges of a circuit court upon a motion to quash an indictment. This decision was re-affirmed in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Avery,&lt;/i&gt; 13 Wall. 251, and in &lt;i&gt;United States&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Canda,&lt;/i&gt; decided at October term 1881.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The case, not being properly before us, is dismissed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
