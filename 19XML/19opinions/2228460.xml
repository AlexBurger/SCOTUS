&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;3 Dall. 486&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;M`KEE'S Lessee&lt;br&gt;
versus&lt;br&gt;
PFOUT.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*488&lt;/span&gt; The general question submitted to the Court, was &#x97; whether a conveyance in fee, by a tenant by the curtesy, is not a forfeiture of his estate? And it was argued by Ingersoll, for the Lessor of the Plaintiff, and by Duncan and C. Smith, for the Defendant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*489&lt;/span&gt; The court stopped Ingersoll, when he was about to reply, and delivered their opinion as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M`KEAN, Chief Justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We entertain no doubt on the present question. The Legislature has, at various periods, and on a variety of subjects, departed from feudal ceremonies and principles, in relation to the transfer and descent of property: but, in the present instance, the act of Assembly meant only to give to a grant of lands, a greater effect upon the estate, on recording the deed, than could previously have been enjoyed, without livery of seizen: It never contemplated that circumstance, as an instrument to work a forfeiture, on the common law doctrine of alienation by tenant for life, or years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHIPPEN, Justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the words of the act of Assembly, it is plain, I think, that the Legislature did not mean to work the forfeiture of a particular estate, by the provision for recording deeds. In allowing to deeds recorded the same force and effect, as feoffments with livery, the intention is expressly restricted &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*490&lt;/span&gt; to "giving possession and seisen, and making good the title and assurance of lands, tenements, and hereditaments." It is, therefore, merely a facility and benefit extended to the grantee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YEATES and SMITH, Justices, concurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUDGMENT for the Plaintiff.&lt;/p&gt;
