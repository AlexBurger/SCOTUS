&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;109 U.S. 173 (1883)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;GUION&lt;br&gt;
v.&lt;br&gt;
LIVERPOOL, LONDON, AND GLOBE INSURANCE CO.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued October 15th, 1883.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided November 5th, 1883.&lt;/center&gt;
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE DISTRICT OF INDIANA.
&lt;p&gt;The case was argued simultaneously with the case of &lt;i&gt;The Indiana Southern Railroad Company,&lt;/i&gt; and by the same counsel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE, in delivering the opinion of the court in that case, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petition of Guion was for leave to appeal from a decree in a suit to which he was not a party. We decided in &lt;i&gt;Ex parte Cutting,&lt;/i&gt; 94 U.S. 14, that such an appeal could not be taken. He had applied for leave to become a party, but this leave was not given. So he is not a party to the decree from which he appeals. But if he is, he has never perfected an appeal by giving the necessary security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Appeal dismissed for want of jurisdiction.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</opinion>
