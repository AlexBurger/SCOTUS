&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;After-Order.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the district court of the United States for the district of Texas; and it appearing to the court here that a stipulation, by the counsel of the respective parties, to dismiss this appeal, at the costs of the appellants, has been filed in this cause, it is thereupon, on the motion of Mr. Coxe, of counsel for the appellee, now here ordered and decreed by this court, that this appeal be and the same is hereby dismissed, with costs.&lt;/p&gt;
