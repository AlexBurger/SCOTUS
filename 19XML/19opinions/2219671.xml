&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*385&lt;/span&gt; At the opening of the Term, Dallas and Du Ponceau had obtained a rule, that the Plaintiff shew his cause of action, and why the Defendant should not be discharged on filing a common appearance; and now Ingerfoll and E. Tilghman shewed cause, produced the bills of exchange, and the Plaintiff's positive affidavit of a subsisting debt, including a declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Counsel for the Defendant were stopped when they rose to reply; and THE COURT were unanimously and clearly of opinion, that the contract was made on account of the government; that the credit was given to it as an official engagement; and that, therefore, there was no cause of action against the present Defendant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule was, accordingly, made absolute; and the Plaintiff soon afterwards discontinued the action.&lt;/p&gt;
