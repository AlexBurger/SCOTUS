&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;102 U.S. 121 (____)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;BANKING ASSOCIATION&lt;br&gt;
v.&lt;br&gt;
INSURANCE ASSOCIATION.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. J.D. Rouse and Mr. William Grant for the appellant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Charles B. Singleton, Jr., contra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this record it appears affirmatively that the only dispute between the parties is as to the right of the insurance association to withhold a transfer of stock until an indebtedness of a stockholder to it for $2,074.36 is paid. Such being the case, we have no jurisdiction of this appeal. In Gray v. Blanchard (97 U.S. 564) we held that a writ of error must be dismissed when it appears from the record, taken as a whole, that the amount actually in controversy between the parties was not sufficient to give us jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appeal dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
