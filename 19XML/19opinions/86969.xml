&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;JAMES B. PECK ET AL., APPELLANTS,&lt;br&gt;
v.&lt;br&gt;
JOHN SANDERSON, LIBELLANT.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rush, of counsel for the appellee, now stated to the court that a petition from the appellee was on file, verified by affidavit, and moved for a rehearing, which was opposed by Mr. Wahr, counsel for the appellant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered the opinion of the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case was decided at the last term, on an appeal from the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, and a motion is now made by Mr. Rush, counsel for the appellee, for a reargument, on the ground that he was prevented by sickness from attending the court at the time of the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a subject of regret that any cause should be heard in the absence of counsel, and especially where the cause of absence, by a failure in the mail, was unknown to the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above case, the brief of the counsel was before the court, and it is not probable that an oral argument would have changed the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the case of Browder v. McArthur, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/rnH/browder-v-mcarthur/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wheat.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;58&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, it was held that this court cannot grant a rehearing in a case which has been remitted to the court below; and in the case of the Washington Bridge Company v. Stewart et al. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;How.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;413&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the same principle was recognized. The motion is overruled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</opinion>
