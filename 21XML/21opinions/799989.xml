&#xD;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&#xD;
                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT&#xD;
&#xD;
       No. 04–563.      Argued April 19, 2005—Decided June 23, 2005&#xD;
Respondent Felix was convicted of murder and robbery in California&#xD;
  state court and sentenced to life imprisonment. His current applica-&#xD;
  tion for federal habeas relief centers on two alleged trial-court errors,&#xD;
  both involving the admission of out-of-court statements during the&#xD;
  prosecutor’s case-in-chief but otherwise unrelated. Felix had made&#xD;
  inculpatory statements during pretrial police interrogation. He al-&#xD;
  leged that those statements were coerced, and that their admission&#xD;
  violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.&#xD;
  He also alleged that the admission of a videotape recording of testi-&#xD;
  mony of a prosecution witness violated the Sixth Amendment’s Con-&#xD;
  frontation Clause.&#xD;
     Felix’s conviction was affirmed on appeal and became final on Au-&#xD;
  gust 12, 1997. Under the one-year limitation period imposed by the&#xD;
  Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28&#xD;
  U. S. C. §2244(d)(1), Felix had until August 12, 1998 to file a habeas&#xD;
  petition in federal court. On May 8, 1998, in a timely filed habeas pe-&#xD;
  tition, Felix asserted his Confrontation Clause challenge to admission&#xD;
  of the videotaped prosecution witness testimony, but did not then&#xD;
  challenge the admission of his own pretrial statements. On January&#xD;
  28, 1999, over five months after the August 12, 1998 expiration of&#xD;
  AEDPA’s time limit and eight months after the court appointed coun-&#xD;
  sel to represent him, Felix filed an amended petition asserting a Fifth&#xD;
  Amendment objection to admission of his pretrial statements. In re-&#xD;
  sponse to the State’s argument that the Fifth Amendment claim was&#xD;
  time barred, Felix asserted the rule that pleading amendments relate&#xD;
  back to the filing date of the original pleading when both the original&#xD;
  plea and the amendment arise out of the same “conduct, transaction,&#xD;
  or occurrence set forth . . . in the original pleading,” Fed. Rule Civ.&#xD;
2                           MAYLE v. FELIX&#xD;
&#xD;
                                  Syllabus&#xD;
&#xD;
    Proc. 15(c)(2). Because his Fifth Amendment and Confrontation&#xD;
    Clause claims challenged the constitutionality of the same criminal&#xD;
    conviction, Felix urged, both claims arose out of the same “conduct,&#xD;
    transaction, or occurrence.” The District Court dismissed the Fifth&#xD;
    Amendment claim as time barred, and rejected the Confrontation&#xD;
    Clause claim on its merits. The Ninth Circuit affirmed as to the lat-&#xD;
    ter claim, but reversed the dismissal of the coerced statements claim&#xD;
    and remanded it for further proceedings. In the court’s view, the&#xD;
    relevant “transaction” for Rule 15(c)(2) purposes was Felix’s state-&#xD;
    court trial and conviction. Defining transaction with greater specific-&#xD;
    ity, the court reasoned, would unduly strain the meaning of “conduct,&#xD;
    transaction, or occurrence” by dividing the trial and conviction into a&#xD;
    series of individual occurrences.&#xD;
Held: An amended habeas petition does not relate back (and thereby&#xD;
 avoid AEDPA’s one-year time limit) when it asserts a new ground for&#xD;
 relief supported by facts that differ in both time and type from those&#xD;
 set forth in the original pleading. Pp. 7–18.&#xD;
    (a) Under §2244(d)(1), a one-year limitation period applies to a&#xD;
 state prisoner’s federal habeas application. Habeas Corpus Rule 11&#xD;
 permits application of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in habeas&#xD;
 cases “to the extent [the civil rules] are not inconsistent with any&#xD;
 statutory provisions or [the habeas] rules.” Section 2242 provides&#xD;
 that habeas applications “may be amended . . . as provided in the&#xD;
 rules of procedure applicable to civil actions.” Federal Rule of Civil&#xD;
 Procedure 15(a) allows pleading amendments with “leave of court”&#xD;
 any time during a proceeding. Before a responsive pleading is&#xD;
 served, pleadings may be amended once as a “matter of course,” i.e.,&#xD;
 without seeking court leave. Ibid. Amendments made after the stat-&#xD;
 ute of limitations has run relate back to the date of the original&#xD;
 pleading if the original and amended pleadings “ar[i]se out of the&#xD;
 same conduct, transaction, or occurrence.” Rule 15(c)(2). The “origi-&#xD;
 nal pleading” in a habeas proceeding is the petition as initially filed.&#xD;
 That pleading must “specify all the grounds for relief available to the&#xD;
 petitioner” and “state the facts supporting each ground.” Habeas&#xD;
 Corpus Rule 2(c). A prime purpose of Rule 2(c)’s demand that peti-&#xD;
 tioners plead with particularity is to assist the district court in de-&#xD;
 termining whether the State should be ordered to “show cause why&#xD;
 the writ should not be granted,” §2243, or the petition instead should&#xD;
 be summarily dismissed without ordering a responsive pleading.&#xD;
 Habeas Corpus Rule 4. Pp. 7–9.&#xD;
    (b) Under the Ninth Circuit’s comprehensive definition of “conduct,&#xD;
 transaction, or occurrence,” virtually any new claim introduced in an&#xD;
 amended habeas petition will relate back, for federal habeas claims,&#xD;
 by their very nature, challenge the constitutionality of a conviction or&#xD;
                   Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                      3&#xD;
&#xD;
                              Syllabus&#xD;
&#xD;
sentence, and commonly attack proceedings anterior thereto. The&#xD;
majority of Circuits define “conduct, transaction, or occurrence” in&#xD;
federal habeas cases far less broadly, allowing relation back only&#xD;
when the claims added by amendment arise from the same core facts&#xD;
as the timely filed claims, and not when the new claims depend upon&#xD;
events separate in both time and type from the originally raised epi-&#xD;
sodes. Under that view, Felix’s own pretrial statements, newly&#xD;
raised in his amended petition, would not relate back because they&#xD;
were separated in time and type from the videotaped witness testi-&#xD;
mony. This Court is not aware, in the run-of-the-mine civil proceed-&#xD;
ings Rule 15 governs, of any reading of “conduct, transaction, or oc-&#xD;
currence” as capacious as the Ninth Circuit’s construction for habeas&#xD;
cases. Decisions applying Rule 15(c)(2) in the civil context illustrate&#xD;
that Rule 15(c)(2) relaxes, but does not obliterate, the statute of limi-&#xD;
tations; hence relation back depends on the existence of a common&#xD;
core of operative facts uniting the original and newly asserted claims.&#xD;
The Court disagrees with Felix’s assertion that he seeks, and the&#xD;
Ninth Circuit accorded, no wider range for Rule 15(c)’s relation-back&#xD;
provision than was given the words “conduct, transaction, or occur-&#xD;
rence” in Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 323 U. S. 574, 580–581.&#xD;
There, the amended complaint invoked a legal theory not suggested&#xD;
in the original complaint and relied on facts not originally asserted.&#xD;
Relation back was nevertheless permitted. In Tiller, however, there&#xD;
was but one “occurrence,” the death of the petitioner’s husband,&#xD;
which she attributed throughout to the respondent’s failure to pro-&#xD;
vide a safe workplace. In contrast, Felix targeted discrete episodes,&#xD;
the videotaped witness testimony in his original petition and his own&#xD;
interrogation at a different time and place in his amended petition.&#xD;
Pp. 9–13.&#xD;
   Felix’s contention that the trial itself is the appropriate “transac-&#xD;
tion” or “occurrence” artificially truncates his claims by homing in&#xD;
only on what makes those claims actionable in a habeas proceeding.&#xD;
Although his self-incrimination claim did not ripen until the prosecu-&#xD;
tor introduced his pretrial statements at trial, the essential predicate&#xD;
for his Fifth Amendment claim was an extrajudicial event, i.e., an&#xD;
out-of-court police interrogation. The dispositive question in an ad-&#xD;
judication of that claim would be the character of the police interro-&#xD;
gation, specifically, did Felix answer voluntarily or were his state-&#xD;
ments coerced. See Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 513–514.&#xD;
Under Habeas Corpus Rule 2(c)’s particularity-in-pleading require-&#xD;
ment, Felix’s Confrontation Clause claim would be pleaded discretely,&#xD;
as would his self-incrimination claim. Each separate congeries of&#xD;
facts supporting the grounds for relief, the Rule suggests, would de-&#xD;
lineate an “occurrence.” Felix’s and the Ninth Circuit’s approach is&#xD;
4                             MAYLE v. FELIX&#xD;
&#xD;
                                   Syllabus&#xD;
&#xD;
    boundless by comparison, allowing a miscellany of claims for relief to&#xD;
    be raised later rather than sooner and to relate back. If claims as-&#xD;
    serted after the one-year period could be revived simply because they re-&#xD;
    late to the same trial, conviction, or sentence as a timely filed claim,&#xD;
    AEDPA’s limitation period would have slim significance. Pp. 13–16.&#xD;
       Felix’s argument that a firm check against petition amendments pre-&#xD;
    senting new, discrete claims after AEDPA’s limitation period has run is&#xD;
    provided by Rule 15(a)—which gives district courts discretion to deny&#xD;
    petition amendments once a responsive pleading has been filed—&#xD;
    overlooks a pleader’s right to amend without leave of court “any time be-&#xD;
    fore a responsive pleading is served.” That time can be long under Ha-&#xD;
    beas Corpus Rule 4, pursuant to which a petition is not served until the&#xD;
    judge first examines it to determine whether “it plainly appears . . . that&#xD;
    the petitioner is not entitled to relief.” This Court’s reading that rela-&#xD;
    tion back will be in order so long as the original and amended peti-&#xD;
    tions state claims that are tied to a common core of operative facts is&#xD;
    consistent with Rule 15(c)(2)’s general application in civil cases, with&#xD;
    Habeas Corpus Rule 2(c), and with AEDPA’s tight time line for peti-&#xD;
    tions. Pp. 16–18.&#xD;
379 F. 3d 612, reversed and remanded.&#xD;

   DENEICE A. MAYLE, WARDEN, PETITIONER v.&#xD;
              JACOBY LEE FELIX&#xD;
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&#xD;
            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&#xD;
                                 [June 23, 2005]&#xD;
&#xD;
   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.&#xD;
   This case involves two federal prescriptions: the one-&#xD;
year limitation period imposed on federal habeas corpus&#xD;
petitioners by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death&#xD;
Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. §2244(d)(1); and&#xD;
the rule that pleading amendments relate back to the&#xD;
filing date of the original pleading when both the original&#xD;
plea and the amendment arise out of the same “conduct,&#xD;
transaction, or occurrence,” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(c)(2).&#xD;
   Jacoby Lee Felix, California prisoner and federal habeas&#xD;
petitioner, was convicted in California state court of first-&#xD;
degree murder and second-degree robbery, and received a&#xD;
life sentence.    Within the one-year limitation period&#xD;
AEDPA allows for habeas petitions, Felix filed a pro se&#xD;
petition in federal court. He initially alleged, inter alia,&#xD;
that the admission into evidence of videotaped testimony&#xD;
of a witness for the prosecution violated his rights under&#xD;
the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause.             Five&#xD;
months after the expiration of AEDPA’s time limit, and&#xD;
eight months after the federal court appointed counsel to&#xD;
represent him, Felix filed an amended petition in which he&#xD;
2                         MAYLE v. FELIX&#xD;
&#xD;
                         Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
added a new claim for relief: He asserted that, in the&#xD;
course of pretrial interrogation, the police used coercive&#xD;
tactics to obtain damaging statements from him, and that&#xD;
admission of those statements at trial violated his Fifth&#xD;
Amendment right against self-incrimination. The ques-&#xD;
tion presented concerns the timeliness of Felix’s Fifth&#xD;
Amendment claim.&#xD;
   In ordinary civil proceedings, the governing Rule, Rule 8&#xD;
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, requires only “a&#xD;
short and plain statement of the claim showing that the&#xD;
pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2).&#xD;
Rule 2(c) of the Rules Governing Habeas Corpus Cases&#xD;
requires a more detailed statement. The habeas rule&#xD;
instructs the petitioner to “specify all the grounds for relief&#xD;
available to [him]” and to “state the facts supporting each&#xD;
ground.”1 By statute, Congress provided that a habeas&#xD;
petition “may be amended . . . as provided in the rules of&#xD;
procedure applicable to civil actions.” 28 U. S. C. §2242.&#xD;
The Civil Rule on amended pleadings, Rule 15 of the&#xD;
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, instructs: “An amend-&#xD;
ment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original&#xD;
pleading when . . . the claim . . . asserted in the amended&#xD;
pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occur-&#xD;
rence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original&#xD;
pleading.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(c)(2).&#xD;
   The issue before us is one on which federal appellate&#xD;
courts have divided: Whether, under Federal Rule of Civil&#xD;
Procedure 15(c)(2), Felix’s amended petition, filed after&#xD;
AEDPA’s one-year limitation and targeting his pretrial&#xD;
statements, relates back to the date of his original timely&#xD;
filed petition, which targeted the videotaped witness&#xD;
&#xD;
——————&#xD;
    1 TheHabeas Corpus Rules were recently amended, effective Decem-&#xD;
ber 1, 2004. Because the amended Rules are not materially different&#xD;
from those in effect when Felix filed his habeas petition, this opinion&#xD;
refers to the current version of the Rules.&#xD;
                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           3&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
testimony. Felix urges, and the Court of Appeals held,&#xD;
that the amended petition qualifies for relation back be-&#xD;
cause both the original petition and the amended pleading&#xD;
arose from the same trial and conviction. We reverse the&#xD;
Court of Appeals’ judgment in this regard. An amended&#xD;
habeas petition, we hold, does not relate back (and thereby&#xD;
escape AEDPA’s one-year time limit) when it asserts a&#xD;
new ground for relief supported by facts that differ in both&#xD;
time and type from those the original pleading set forth.&#xD;
                               I&#xD;
   In 1995, after a jury trial in Sacramento, California,&#xD;
respondent Jacoby Lee Felix was found guilty of murder&#xD;
and robbery stemming from his participation in a carjack-&#xD;
ing in which the driver of the car was shot and killed.&#xD;
App. E to Pet. for Cert. 2–7. He was sentenced to life&#xD;
imprisonment without the possibility of parole. App. C to&#xD;
Pet. for Cert. 1–2. The current controversy centers on two&#xD;
alleged errors at Felix’s trial. Both involve the admission&#xD;
of out-of-court statements during the prosecutor’s case in&#xD;
chief, but the two are otherwise unrelated. One prompted&#xD;
a Fifth Amendment self-incrimination objection originally&#xD;
raised in the trial court, the other, a Sixth Amendment&#xD;
Confrontation Clause challenge, also raised in the trial&#xD;
proceedings.&#xD;
   Felix’s Fifth Amendment claim rested on the prosecu-&#xD;
tion’s introduction of statements Felix made during pre-&#xD;
trial police interrogation. These statements were adduced&#xD;
at trial on direct examination of the investigating officer.&#xD;
Felix urged that the police used coercive tactics to elicit&#xD;
the statements. Id., at 8–9. His Sixth Amendment claim&#xD;
related to the admission of the videotaped statements&#xD;
prosecution witness Kenneth Williams made at a jailhouse&#xD;
interview. The videotape records Williams, a friend of&#xD;
Felix, telling the police that he had overheard a conversa-&#xD;
tion in which Felix described the planned robbery just&#xD;
4                      MAYLE v. FELIX&#xD;
&#xD;
                      Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
before it occurred. When Williams testified at trial that he&#xD;
did not recall the police interview, the trial court deter-&#xD;
mined that Williams’ loss of memory was feigned, and that&#xD;
the videotape was admissible because it contained prior&#xD;
inconsistent statements. App. E to Pet. for Cert. 10–13.&#xD;
  On direct appeal, Felix urged, inter alia, that the admis-&#xD;
sion of Williams’ videotaped statements violated Felix’s&#xD;
constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him.&#xD;
He did not, however, argue that admission of his own&#xD;
pretrial statements violated his right to protection against&#xD;
self-incrimination.     The intermediate appellate court&#xD;
affirmed Felix’s conviction and sentence, id., at 10–13, 17,&#xD;
and the California Supreme Court denied his petition for&#xD;
review, App. F to Pet. for Cert. 2. Felix’s conviction be-&#xD;
came final on August 12, 1997. App. C to Pet. for Cert. 10.&#xD;
  Under AEDPA’s one-year statute of limitations, Felix&#xD;
had until August 12, 1998 to file a petition for a writ of&#xD;
habeas corpus in federal district court. See §2244(d)(1)(A).&#xD;
Within the one-year period, on May 8, 1998, he filed a pro&#xD;
se petition for federal habeas relief. Felix’s federal petition&#xD;
repeated his Sixth Amendment objection to the admission&#xD;
of the Williams videotape, but he again failed to reassert&#xD;
the objection he made in the trial court to the admission of&#xD;
his own pretrial statements. App. G to Pet. for Cert. 1–7.&#xD;
On May 29, 1998, a Magistrate Judge appointed counsel to&#xD;
represent Felix. App. C to Pet. for Cert. 6; App. H to Pet.&#xD;
for Cert. 2. Thereafter, on September 15, 1998, the Magis-&#xD;
trate Judge ordered Felix to file an amended petition&#xD;
within 30 days. Id., at 3. On Felix’s unopposed requests,&#xD;
that period was successively extended. Id., at 4–5. Pend-&#xD;
ing the filing of an amended petition, the State was not&#xD;
required to interpose an answer.&#xD;
  On January 28, 1999, over five months after the August&#xD;
12, 1998 expiration of AEDPA’s time limit, and eight&#xD;
months after the appointment of counsel to represent him,&#xD;
Felix filed an amended petition. Id., at 5. In this plead-&#xD;

&#xD;
                        Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
ing, he reasserted his Confrontation Clause claim, and&#xD;
also asserted, for the first time post-trial, that his own&#xD;
pretrial statements to the police were coerced and there-&#xD;
fore inadmissible at trial. App. I to Pet. for Cert. 4. Fur-&#xD;
ther, he alleged that his counsel on appeal to the Califor-&#xD;
nia intermediate appellate court was ineffective in failing&#xD;
to raise the coerced confession claim on direct appeal. Id.,&#xD;
at 18–19.2 In its answer to the amended petition, the&#xD;
State asserted that the Fifth Amendment claim was time&#xD;
barred because it was initially raised after the expiration&#xD;
of AEDPA’s one-year limitation period. Felix argued in&#xD;
response that the new claim related back to the date of his&#xD;
original petition. Because both Fifth Amendment and&#xD;
Confrontation Clause claims challenged the constitutional-&#xD;
ity of the same criminal conviction, Felix urged, the Fifth&#xD;
Amendment claim arose out of the “conduct, transaction,&#xD;
or occurrence set forth . . . in the original pleading,” Fed.&#xD;
Rule Civ. Proc. 15(c)(2). App. C to Pet. for Cert. 16.&#xD;
   The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of Felix’s&#xD;
Fifth Amendment coerced statements claim. Relation&#xD;
back was not in order, the Magistrate said, because Felix’s&#xD;
“allegedly involuntary statements to police d[id] not arise&#xD;
out of the same conduct, transaction or occurrence as the&#xD;
videotaped interrogation of [prosecution witness] Kenneth&#xD;
Williams.” Id., at 16. It did not suffice, the Magistrate&#xD;
——————&#xD;
   2 Because Felix had not presented his coerced statements Fifth&#xD;
&#xD;
Amendment claim on appeal to the California courts, the State moved&#xD;
to dismiss the amended petition on the ground that it contained both&#xD;
exhausted and unexhausted claims. See 28 U. S. C. §2254(b)(1)(A);&#xD;
Brief for Respondent 6–7. Before the Magistrate Judge acted on the&#xD;
motion, Felix presented the coerced statements/ineffective assistance&#xD;
claim to the California Supreme Court in a habeas petition. Opposition&#xD;

6                     MAYLE v. FELIX&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
observed, that Felix’s Fifth and Sixth Amendment claims&#xD;
attack the same criminal conviction. Ibid. Adopting the&#xD;
Magistrate Judge’s report and recommendation in full, the&#xD;
District Court dismissed the Fifth Amendment claim as&#xD;
time barred, and rejected the Confrontation Clause claim&#xD;
on its merits. App. B to Pet. for Cert. 1–3.&#xD;
   A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth&#xD;
Circuit affirmed the District Court’s dismissal of Felix’s&#xD;
Confrontation Clause claim, but reversed the dismissal of&#xD;
his coerced statements claim and remanded that claim for&#xD;
further proceedings. 379 F. 3d 612 (2004). In the major-&#xD;
ity’s view, the relevant “transaction” for purposes of Rule&#xD;
15(c)(2) was Felix’s “trial and conviction in state court.”&#xD;
Id., at 615. Defining the transaction at any greater level&#xD;
of specificity, the majority reasoned, would “unduly&#xD;
strai[n] the usual meaning of ‘conduct, transaction, or&#xD;
occurrence’ ” by dividing the “trial and conviction [into] a&#xD;
series of perhaps hundreds of individual occurrences.”&#xD;
Ibid. Judge Tallman concurred in part and dissented in&#xD;
part. In his view, defining “conduct, transaction, or occur-&#xD;
rence” under Rule 15(c)(2) “so broadly that any claim&#xD;
stemming from pre-trial motions, the trial, or sentencing&#xD;
relates back to a timely-filed habeas petition” would&#xD;
“obliterat[e] AEDPA’s one year statute of limitation.” Id.,&#xD;
at 618. “While an amendment offered to clarify or amplify&#xD;
the facts already alleged in support of a timely claim may&#xD;
relate back,” he reasoned, “an amendment that introduces&#xD;
a new legal theory based on facts different from those&#xD;
underlying the timely claim may not.” Id., at 621.&#xD;
   We granted certiorari, 543 U. S. ___ (2005), to resolve&#xD;
the conflict among Courts of Appeals on relation back of&#xD;
habeas petition amendments. Compare 379 F. 3d, at 614&#xD;
(if original petition is timely filed, amendments referring&#xD;
to the same trial and conviction may relate back); Ellzey v.&#xD;
United States, 324 F. 3d 521, 525–527 (CA7 2003) (same),&#xD;

&#xD;
                          Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
(CADC 2002) (relevant transaction must be defined more&#xD;
narrowly than the trial and conviction); United States v.&#xD;
Espinoza-Saenz, 235 F. 3d 501, 503–505 (CA10 2000)&#xD;
(same); Davenport v. United States, 217 F. 3d 1341, 1344–&#xD;

States v. Craycraft, 167 F. 3d 451, 457 (CA8 1999) (same).&#xD;
We now reverse the Ninth Circuit’s judgment to the extent&#xD;
that it allowed relation back of Felix’s Fifth Amendment&#xD;
claim.&#xD;
                               II&#xD;
                               A&#xD;
   In enacting AEDPA in 1996, Congress imposed for the&#xD;
first time a fixed time limit for collateral attacks in federal&#xD;
court on a judgment of conviction. Section 2244(d)(1)&#xD;
provides: “A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an&#xD;
application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in&#xD;
custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.” See&#xD;
also §2255, ¶6 (providing one-year limitation period in&#xD;
which to file a motion to vacate a federal conviction).3&#xD;
   A discrete set of Rules governs federal habeas proceed-&#xD;
ings launched by state prisoners. See Rules Governing&#xD;
Section 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts.4&#xD;
The last of those Rules, Habeas Corpus Rule 11, permits&#xD;
application of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in&#xD;
habeas cases “to the extent that [the civil rules] are not&#xD;
inconsistent with any statutory provisions or [the habeas]&#xD;
rules.” See also Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 81(a)(2) (The civil&#xD;
rules “are applicable to proceedings for . . . habeas cor-&#xD;
pus.”). Rule 11, the Advisory Committee’s Notes caution,&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  3 Section  2255 establishes a separate avenue for postconviction chal-&#xD;
lenges to federal, as opposed to state, convictions.&#xD;
   4 Habeas corpus proceedings are characterized as civil in nature. See,&#xD;
&#xD;
e.g., Fisher v. Baker, 203 U. S. 174, 181 (1906).&#xD;
8                     MAYLE v. FELIX&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
“permits application of the civil rules only when it would&#xD;
be appropriate to do so,” and would not be “inconsistent or&#xD;
inequitable in the overall framework of habeas corpus.”&#xD;
Advisory Committee’s Note on Habeas Corpus Rule 11, 28&#xD;
U. S. C., p. 480. In addition to the general prescriptions&#xD;
on application of the civil rules in federal habeas cases,&#xD;
§2242 specifically provides that habeas applications “may&#xD;
be amended . . . as provided in the rules of procedure&#xD;
applicable to civil actions.”&#xD;
  The Civil Rule governing pleading amendments, Federal&#xD;
Rule of Civil Procedure 15, made applicable to habeas&#xD;
proceedings by §2242, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure&#xD;
81(a)(2), and Habeas Corpus Rule 11, allows pleading&#xD;
amendments with “leave of court” any time during a pro-&#xD;
ceeding. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(a). Before a respon-&#xD;
sive pleading is served, pleadings may be amended once as&#xD;
a “matter of course,” i.e., without seeking court leave.&#xD;
Ibid. Amendments made after the statute of limitations&#xD;
has run relate back to the date of the original pleading if&#xD;
the original and amended pleadings “ar[i]se out of the&#xD;
conduct, transaction, or occurrence.” Rule 15(c)(2).&#xD;
  The “original pleading” to which Rule 15 refers is the&#xD;
complaint in an ordinary civil case, and the petition in a&#xD;
habeas proceeding. Under Rule 8(a), applicable to ordi-&#xD;
nary civil proceedings, a complaint need only provide “fair&#xD;
notice of what the plaintiff’s claim is and the grounds upon&#xD;
which it rests.” Conley v. Gibson, 355 U. S. 41, 47 (1957).&#xD;
Habeas Corpus Rule 2(c) is more demanding. It provides&#xD;
that the petition must “specify all the grounds for relief&#xD;
available to the petitioner” and “state the facts supporting&#xD;
each ground.” See also Advisory Committee’s Note on&#xD;
subd. (c) of Habeas Corpus Rule 2, 28 U. S. C., p. 469 (“In&#xD;
the past, petitions have frequently contained mere conclu-&#xD;
sions of law, unsupported by any facts. [But] it is the&#xD;
relationship of the facts to the claim asserted that is im-&#xD;
portant . . . .”); Advisory Committee’s Note on Habeas&#xD;
                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            9&#xD;
&#xD;
                      Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
Corpus Rule 4, 28 U. S. C., p. 471 (“ ‘[N]otice’ pleading is&#xD;
not sufficient, for the petition is expected to state facts&#xD;
that point to a real possibility of constitutional error.”&#xD;
(internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, the&#xD;
model form available to aid prisoners in filing their habeas&#xD;
petitions instructs in boldface:&#xD;
    “CAUTION: You must include in this petition all&#xD;
    the grounds for relief from the conviction or&#xD;
    sentence that you challenge. And you must&#xD;
    state the facts that support each ground. If you&#xD;
    fail to set forth all the grounds in this petition,&#xD;
    you may be barred from presenting additional&#xD;
    grounds at a later date.” Petition for Relief From a&#xD;
    Conviction or Sentence By a Person in State Custody,&#xD;
    Habeas Corpus Rules, Forms App. (emphasis in&#xD;
    original).&#xD;
  A prime purpose of Rule 2(c)’s demand that habeas&#xD;
petitioners plead with particularity is to assist the district&#xD;
court in determining whether the State should be ordered&#xD;
to “show cause why the writ should not be granted.”&#xD;
§2243. Under Habeas Corpus Rule 4, if “it plainly appears&#xD;
from the petition . . . that the petitioner is not entitled to&#xD;
relief in district court,” the court must summarily dismiss&#xD;
the petition without ordering a responsive pleading. If the&#xD;
court orders the State to file an answer, that pleading&#xD;
must “address the allegations in the petition.” Rule 5.&#xD;
                             B&#xD;
  This case turns on the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil&#xD;
Procedure 15(c)(2)’s relation-back provision in the context&#xD;
of federal habeas proceedings and AEDPA’s one-year&#xD;
statute of limitations. Rule 15(c)(2), as earlier stated,&#xD;
provides that pleading amendments relate back to the&#xD;
date of the original pleading when the claim asserted in&#xD;
the amended plea “arose out of the conduct, transaction, or&#xD;
10                    MAYLE v. FELIX&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the&#xD;
original pleading.” The key words are “conduct, transac-&#xD;
tion, or occurrence.” The Ninth Circuit, whose judgment&#xD;
we here review, in accord with the Seventh Circuit, de-&#xD;
fines those words to allow relation back of a claim first&#xD;
asserted in an amended petition, so long as the new claim&#xD;
stems from the habeas petitioner’s trial, conviction, or&#xD;
sentence. Under that comprehensive definition, virtually&#xD;
any new claim introduced in an amended petition will&#xD;
relate back, for federal habeas claims, by their very na-&#xD;
ture, challenge the constitutionality of a conviction or&#xD;
sentence, and commonly attack proceedings anterior&#xD;
thereto. See Espinoza-Saenz, 235 F. 3d, at 505 (A “major-&#xD;
ity of amendments” to habeas petitions raise issues falling&#xD;
under the “broad umbrella” of “a defendant’s trial and&#xD;
sentencing.”); Hicks, 283 F. 3d, at 388.&#xD;
   The majority of Circuits, mindful of “Congress’ decision&#xD;
to expedite collateral attacks by placing stringent time&#xD;
restrictions on [them],” id., at 388, define “conduct, trans-&#xD;
action, or occurrence” in federal habeas cases less broadly.&#xD;
See id., at 388–389; Espinoza-Saenz, 235 F. 3d, at 503–&#xD;
505; Davenport, 217 F. 3d, at 1344–1346; Pittman, 209&#xD;
F. 3d, at 317–318; Duffus, 174 F. 3d, at 337; Craycraft, 167&#xD;
F. 3d, at 457. They allow relation back only when the&#xD;
claims added by amendment arise from the same core&#xD;
facts as the timely filed claims, and not when the new&#xD;
claims depend upon events separate in “both time and&#xD;
type” from the originally raised episodes. Craycraft, 167&#xD;
F. 3d, at 457. Because Felix’s own pretrial statements,&#xD;
newly raised in his amended petition, were separated in&#xD;
time and type from witness Williams’ videotaped state-&#xD;
ments, raised in Felix’s original petition, the former would&#xD;
not relate back under the definition of “conduct, transac-&#xD;
tion, or occurrence” to which most Circuits adhere.&#xD;
   We are not aware, in the run-of-the-mine civil proceed-&#xD;
ings Rule 15 governs, of any reading of “conduct, transac-&#xD;
                     Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                  11&#xD;

Ninth and Seventh Circuits have adopted for habeas&#xD;
cases. Compare Maegdlin v. International Assn. of Ma-&#xD;
chinists and Aerospace Workers, 309 F. 3d 1051, 1052&#xD;
(CA8 2002) (allowing relation back where original com-&#xD;
plaint alleged that defendant union had breached its duty&#xD;
of fair representation by inadequately representing plain-&#xD;
tiff because of his gender, and amended complaint as-&#xD;
serted a Title VII gender discrimination claim based on&#xD;
the same differential treatment); Clipper Exxpress v.&#xD;
Rocky Mountain Motor Tariff Bureau, Inc., 690 F. 2d 1240,&#xD;
1246, 1259, n. 29 (CA9 1982) (claim asserting that defen-&#xD;
dant included fraudulent information in rate protests filed&#xD;
with the Interstate Commerce Commission related back to&#xD;
original complaint, which asserted that defendant filed the&#xD;
same rate protests “for the purpose of . . . restricting . . .&#xD;
competition” (internal quotation marks omitted))5;&#xD;
Santana v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 686 F. 2d 736, 738 (CA9&#xD;
1982) (original complaint alleging slander and amendment&#xD;
alleging interference with employment relations arose out&#xD;
of the same conduct or occurrence because both were&#xD;

Rural Fire Protection Co. v. Hepp, 366 F. 2d 355, 361–362&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  5 The dissent asserts that Clipper Exxpress is comparable to this case&#xD;
&#xD;
in according Rule 15(c)(2) a “ ‘capacious’ ” reading. Post, at 4, n. 2.&#xD;
Clipper Exxpress involved a series of allegedly sham protests, com-&#xD;
monly designed to restrain trade, a charge of the pattern or practice&#xD;
type. The amendment in question added a fraud charge, a new legal&#xD;
theory tied to the same operative facts as those initially alleged.&#xD;
Clipper Exxpress, 690 F. 2d, at 1259, n. 29. That unremarkable appli-&#xD;
cation of the relation-back rule bears little resemblance to the argu-&#xD;
ment made by Felix and embraced by the dissent—that all manner of&#xD;
factually and temporally unrelated conduct may be raised after the&#xD;
statute of limitations has run and relate back, so long as the new and&#xD;
originally pleaded claims challenge the same conviction. See infra, at&#xD;
12–15.&#xD;

(CA9 1966) (in a Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 suit&#xD;

amendment asserting the same type of violation during an&#xD;

216 (CA5 1999) (Coastal Plains’s claim that creditor inter-&#xD;

Plains to a third party did not relate back to claim based&#xD;

“broader plan to destroy Coastal [Plains]”); Sierra Club v.&#xD;
Penfold, 857 F. 2d 1307, 1315–1316 (CA9 1988) (where&#xD;
original complaint challenged the manner in which an&#xD;
agency applied a regulation, an amendment challenging&#xD;
the agency’s “conduct in adopting the regulatio[n]” did not&#xD;

Bureau, 135 F. 3d 254, 256 (CA2 1998) (although all of&#xD;
plaintiff’s 42 U. S. C. §1983 claims arose out of a single&#xD;
state-court criminal proceeding, plaintiff’s First Amend-&#xD;
ment claims did not arise out of the same conduct as the&#xD;
originally asserted excessive force claims, and therefore&#xD;
did not relate back). As these decisions illustrate, Rule&#xD;
15(c)(2) relaxes, but does not obliterate, the statute of&#xD;
limitations; hence relation back depends on the existence&#xD;
of a common “core of operative facts” uniting the original&#xD;
and newly asserted claims. See Clipper Exxpress, 690&#xD;

   Felix asserts that he seeks, and the Ninth Circuit ac-&#xD;
corded, no wider range for Rule 15(c)’s relation back provi-&#xD;
sion than this Court gave to the Rule’s key words “con-&#xD;

&#xD;
duct, transaction, or occurrence” in Tiller v. Atlantic Coast&#xD;
Line R. Co., 323 U. S. 574, 580–581 (1945). We disagree.&#xD;
In Tiller, a railroad worker was struck and killed by a&#xD;
railroad car. His widow sued under the Federal Employ-&#xD;
ers Liability Act, 45 U. S. C. §51 et seq., to recover for his&#xD;
wrongful death. She initially alleged various negligent&#xD;
acts. In an amended complaint, she added a claim under&#xD;
the Federal Boiler Inspection Act for failure to provide the&#xD;
train’s locomotive with a rear light. We held that the&#xD;
amendment related back, and therefore avoided a statute&#xD;
of limitations bar, even though the amendment invoked a&#xD;
legal theory not suggested by the original complaint and&#xD;
relied on facts not originally asserted.&#xD;
   There was but one episode-in-suit in Tiller, a worker’s&#xD;
death attributed from the start to the railroad’s failure to&#xD;
provide its employee with a reasonably safe place to work.&#xD;
The federal rulemakers recognized that personal injury&#xD;
plaintiffs often cannot pinpoint the precise cause of an&#xD;
injury prior to discovery. See 5 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller,&#xD;
Federal Practice and Procedure §1215, pp. 138–143 (2d ed.&#xD;
1990). They therefore included in the Appendix to the&#xD;
Federal Rules an illustrative form indicating that a per-&#xD;
sonal injury plaintiff could adequately state a claim for&#xD;
relief simply by alleging that the defendant negligently&#xD;
operated a certain instrumentality at a particular time&#xD;
and place. See Form 9, Complaint for Negligence, Forms&#xD;
App., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc., 28 U. S. C. App., p. 829. The&#xD;
widow in Tiller met that measure. She based her com-&#xD;
plaint on a single “occurrence,” an accident resulting in&#xD;
her husband’s death. In contrast, Felix targeted separate&#xD;
episodes, the pretrial police interrogation of witness Wil-&#xD;
liams in his original petition, his own interrogation at a&#xD;
different time and place in his amended petition.&#xD;
   Felix contends, however, that his amended petition&#xD;
qualifies for relation back because the trial itself is the&#xD;
“transaction” or “occurrence” that counts. See Brief for&#xD;
14                    MAYLE v. FELIX&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
Respondent 21–23. Citing Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U. S.&#xD;
760 (2003) (plurality opinion), Felix urges that neither the&#xD;
videotaped interview with witness Williams nor the pre-&#xD;
trial police interrogation to which Felix himself was ex-&#xD;
posed transgressed any constitutional limitation. Until&#xD;
the statements elicited by the police were introduced at&#xD;
trial, Felix argues, he had no actionable claim at all. Both&#xD;
the confrontation right he timely presented and the privi-&#xD;
lege against self-incrimination he asserted in his amended&#xD;
petition are “trial right[s],” Felix underscores. Brief for&#xD;
Respondent 21 (emphasis deleted). His claims based on&#xD;
those rights, he maintains, are not “separate,” id., at 22;&#xD;
rather, they are related in time and type, for “they arose&#xD;
on successive days during the trial and both challenged&#xD;
[on constitutional grounds] admission of pretrial state-&#xD;
ments,” id., at 22–23.&#xD;
   Felix artificially truncates his claims by homing in only&#xD;
on what makes them actionable in a habeas proceeding.&#xD;
We do not here question his assertion that his Fifth&#xD;
Amendment right did not ripen until his statements were&#xD;
admitted against him at trial. See Chavez, 538 U. S., at&#xD;
766–767. Even so, the essential predicate for his self-&#xD;
incrimination claim was an extrajudicial event, i.e., an&#xD;
out-of-court police interrogation. The dispositive question&#xD;
in an adjudication of that claim would be the character of&#xD;
Felix’s conduct, not in court, but at the police interroga-&#xD;
tion, specifically, did he answer voluntarily or were his&#xD;
statements coerced. See Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S.&#xD;
503, 513–514 (1963) (voluntariness is evaluated by examin-&#xD;
ing the “totality of circumstances” surrounding the “making&#xD;
and signing of the challenged confession”).&#xD;
   Habeas Corpus Rule 2(c), we earlier noted, see supra, at&#xD;
8–9, instructs petitioners to “specify all [available]&#xD;
grounds for relief” and to “state the facts supporting each&#xD;
ground.” Under that Rule, Felix’s Confrontation Clause&#xD;
claim would be pleaded discretely, as would his self-&#xD;
                     Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                   15&#xD;
&#xD;
                          Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
incrimination claim. Each separate congeries of facts&#xD;
supporting the grounds for relief, the Rule suggests, would&#xD;
delineate an “occurrence.” Felix’s approach, the approach&#xD;
that prevailed in the Ninth Circuit, is boundless by com-&#xD;
parison. A miscellany of claims for relief could be raised&#xD;
later rather than sooner and relate back, for “conduct,&#xD;
transaction, or occurrence” would be defined to encompass&#xD;
any pretrial, trial, or post-trial error that could provide a&#xD;
basis for challenging the conviction. An approach of that&#xD;
breadth, as the Fourth Circuit observed, “views ‘occur-&#xD;
rence’ at too high a level of generality.” Pittman, 209&#xD;
F. 3d, at 318.6&#xD;
  Congress enacted AEDPA to advance the finality of&#xD;
criminal convictions. See Rhines v. Weber, 544 U. S. ___,&#xD;
___ (2005) (slip op., at 6). To that end, it adopted a tight&#xD;
time line, a one-year limitation period ordinarily running&#xD;
from “the date on which the judgment became final by the&#xD;
conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for&#xD;
seeking such review,” 28 U. S. C. §2244(d)(1)(A). If claims&#xD;
asserted after the one-year period could be revived simply&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  6 The dissent builds a complex discussion on an apparent assumption&#xD;
that claim preclusion operates in habeas cases largely as it does in&#xD;
mine-run civil cases. See post, at 9–11. Ironically, few habeas petitions&#xD;
would survive swift dismissal were that so, for the very objective of the&#xD;
petition is to undo a final judgment after direct appeals have been&#xD;
exhausted or are time barred. On judicial and legislative development&#xD;
of standards governing successive habeas petitions, standards that do&#xD;
not track the Restatement of Judgments, see Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S.&#xD;
298, 317–320 (1995); 2 R. Hertz &amp; J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus&#xD;
Practice and Procedure §28.2b, pp. 1270–1275 (4th ed. 2001); Note,&#xD;
Developments in the Law—Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv. L. Rev.&#xD;
1038, 1113, 1148–1154 (1970). The dissent would read Rule 15(c)(2)’s&#xD;
words, “conduct, transaction, or occurrence,” into AEDPA’s provisions&#xD;
governing second or successive petitions and motions (28 U. S. C.&#xD;
§§2244(b) and 2255, ¶8), although Congress did not put those words&#xD;
there. Nor is there any other reason to believe that Congress designed&#xD;

                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
because they relate to the same trial, conviction, or sen-&#xD;
tence as a timely filed claim, AEDPA’s limitation period&#xD;
would have slim significance. See 379 F. 3d, at 619&#xD;
(Tallman, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)&#xD;
(Ninth Circuit’s rule would permit “the ‘relation back’&#xD;
doctrine to swallow AEDPA’s statute of limitation”);&#xD;
Pittman, 209 F. 3d, at 318 (“If we were to craft such a rule,&#xD;
it would mean that amendments . . . would almost in-&#xD;
variably be allowed even after the statute of limitations&#xD;
had expired, because most [habeas] claims arise from a&#xD;
criminal defendant’s underlying conviction and sen-&#xD;
tence.”); Duffus, 174 F. 3d, at 338 (“A prisoner should not&#xD;
be able to assert a claim otherwise barred by the statute of&#xD;
limitations merely because he asserted a separate claim&#xD;
within the limitations period.”). The very purpose of Rule&#xD;
15(c)(2), as the dissent notes, is to “qualify a statute of&#xD;
limitations.” Post, at 2.     But “qualify” does not mean&#xD;
repeal. See Fuller v. Marx, 724 F. 2d 717, 720 (CA8 1984).&#xD;
Given AEDPA’s “finality” and “federalism” concerns, see&#xD;
Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 436 (2000); Hicks, 283&#xD;
F. 3d, at 389, it would be anomalous to allow relation back&#xD;
under Rule 15(c)(2) based on a broader reading of the&#xD;
words “conduct, transaction, or occurrence” in federal&#xD;
habeas proceedings than in ordinary civil litigation, see&#xD;
supra, at 10–12.&#xD;
   Felix urges that an unconstrained reading of Rule&#xD;
15(c)(2) is not problematic because Rule 15(a) arms district&#xD;
courts with “ample power” to deny leave to amend when&#xD;
justice so requires. See Brief for Respondent 31–33.&#xD;
Under that Rule, once a responsive pleading has been&#xD;
filed, a prisoner may amend the petition “only by leave of&#xD;
court or by written consent of the adverse party.” Rule&#xD;
15(a); see Ellzey v. United States, 324 F. 3d 521, 526 (CA7&#xD;
2003) (AEDPA’s aim to “expedite resolution of collateral&#xD;
attacks . . . should influence the exercise of discretion&#xD;
under Rule 15(a)—which gives the district judge the right&#xD;
                      Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                     17&#xD;
&#xD;
                           Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
to disapprove proposed amendments that would unduly&#xD;
prolong or complicate the case.”). This argument over-&#xD;
looks a pleader’s right to amend without leave of court&#xD;
“any time before a responsive pleading is served.” Rule&#xD;
15(a). In federal habeas cases that time can be rather&#xD;
long, as indeed it was in the instant case. See supra, at 4.&#xD;
Under Habeas Corpus Rule 4, a petition is not immedi-&#xD;
ately served on the respondent. The judge first examines&#xD;
the pleading to determine whether “it plainly appears . . .&#xD;
that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.” Only if the&#xD;
petition survives that preliminary inspection will the&#xD;
judge “order the respondent to file an answer.” In the&#xD;
interim, the petitioner may amend his pleading “as a&#xD;
matter of course,” as Felix did in this very case. Rule&#xD;
15(a). Accordingly, we do not regard Rule 15(a) as a firm&#xD;
check against petition amendments that present new&#xD;
claims dependent upon discrete facts after AEDPA’s limi-&#xD;
tation period has run.&#xD;
   Our rejection of Felix’s translation of same “conduct,&#xD;
transaction, or occurrence” to mean same “trial, convic-&#xD;
tion, or sentence” scarcely leaves Rule 15(c)(2) “meaning-&#xD;
less in the habeas context,” 379 F. 3d, at 615. So long as&#xD;
the original and amended petitions state claims that are&#xD;
tied to a common core of operative facts, relation back will&#xD;
be in order.7 Our reading is consistent with the general&#xD;
——————&#xD;
   7 For example, in Mandacina v. United States, 328 F. 3d 995, 1000–1001&#xD;
&#xD;
(CA8 2003), the original petition alleged violations of Brady v. Maryland,&#xD;
373 U. S. 83 (1963), while the amended petition alleged the Government’s&#xD;
failure to disclose a particular report. Both pleadings related to evidence&#xD;
obtained at the same time by the same police department. The Court of&#xD;
Appeals approved relation back. And in Woodward v. Williams, 263 F. 3d&#xD;
1135, 1142 (CA10 2001), the appeals court upheld relation back where the&#xD;
original petition challenged the trial court’s admission of recanted state-&#xD;
ments, while the amended petition challenged the court’s refusal to allow&#xD;
the defendant to show that the statements had been recanted. See also 3&#xD;

   8 The dissent is concerned that our decision “creates an unfair dispar-&#xD;
&#xD;
ity between indigent habeas petitioners and those able to afford their&#xD;
own counsel.” Post, at 1; see post, at 11 (“[T]oday’s decision . . . will fall&#xD;
most heavily on the shoulders of indigent habeas petitioners who can&#xD;
afford no counsel without the assistance of the court.”). The concern is&#xD;
understandable, although we note that in Felix’s case, counsel was&#xD;
appointed, and had some two and a half months to amend the petition&#xD;
before AEDPA’s limitation period expired. See supra, at 4. That was&#xD;
ample time to add a claim based on the alleged pretrial extraction of&#xD;
damaging statements from Felix. Ordinarily, as we observed in Halbert&#xD;
v. Michigan, ante, at 17, n. 8, the government (federal or state) “ ‘need not&#xD;
equalize economic conditions’ between criminal defendants of lesser and&#xD;
greater wealth.” (quoting Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12, 23 (1956)&#xD;

U. S. 551, 557 (1987) (holding that States need not provide appointed&#xD;
counsel in postconviction proceedings). This case, it is inescapably true,&#xD;
does not fit within the confined circumstances in which our decisions&#xD;
require appointment of counsel for an indigent litigant at a critical stage&#xD;
to ensure his meaningful access to justice. See Halbert, ante, at 2–4, 17,&#xD;

  JUSTICE SOUTER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS joins,&#xD;
dissenting.&#xD;
  This case requires the Court to decide how the relation&#xD;
back provision of Rule 15(c)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil&#xD;
Procedure ought to apply in federal habeas corpus cases,&#xD;
when neither text nor precedent provides clear guidance.&#xD;
I see nothing in habeas law or practice that calls for the&#xD;
Court’s narrow construction of the rule, and good reasons&#xD;
to go the other way, including the unfortunate conse-&#xD;
quence that the Court’s view creates an unfair disparity&#xD;
between indigent habeas petitioners and those able to&#xD;
afford their own counsel. I respectfully dissent.&#xD;
                             I&#xD;
  At the outset, there is need for care in understanding&#xD;
the narrow scope of the problem this case presents. A&#xD;
habeas petitioner’s opportunity to amend as a matter of&#xD;
course, without permission of the trial court, exists only&#xD;
before the responsive pleading is served, and even then&#xD;
only once. Rule 15(a). After one amendment, or after the&#xD;
government files the answer or other response, assuming&#xD;
one is even required, see Habeas Corpus Rule 4, the pris-&#xD;
oner may not amend without the court’s leave or the gov-&#xD;
ernment’s consent, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(a). While leave&#xD;
to amend “shall be freely given when justice so requires,”&#xD;

                     SOUTER, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
ibid., justice does, after all, have to require it, and the&#xD;
District Courts will presumably say no, for example, in the&#xD;
face of unjustifiable delay or threatened prejudice to the&#xD;
State. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U. S. 178, 182 (1962); see&#xD;
also Brief for Professor Arthur R. Miller et al. as Amici&#xD;
Curiae 20–21 (describing reasons courts regularly deny&#xD;
leave to amend and citing cases); 6 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp;&#xD;
M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §§1487–1488 (2d&#xD;
ed. 1990) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller) (discussing reasons&#xD;
leave to amend may be and often is denied, including delay&#xD;
and prejudice). The Court’s concern for “unconstrained”&#xD;
recourse to petition amendments, ante, at 16, is thus&#xD;
misplaced.&#xD;
   The limited opportunity to amend also supplies perspec-&#xD;
tive on the claim that Felix’s reading of the relation back&#xD;
rule would undermine the 1-year limitation period of the&#xD;
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996&#xD;
(AEDPA) and the statute’s concomitant concern for final-&#xD;
ity of judgments. See ante, at 15–16. In fact, AEDPA’s&#xD;
objectives bear little weight in the analysis, because the&#xD;
very point of every relation back rule is to qualify a statute&#xD;
of limitations, and Rule 15(c) “is based on the notion that&#xD;
once litigation involving particular conduct or a given&#xD;
transaction or occurrence has been instituted, the parties&#xD;
are not entitled to the protection of the statute of limita-&#xD;
tions against the later assertion by amendment of de-&#xD;
fenses or claims that arise out of the same conduct, trans-&#xD;
action, or occurrence as set forth in the original pleading.”&#xD;
6A Wright &amp; Miller §1496, at 64. That AEDPA’s statute&#xD;
of limitations, like any other, may be trumped by relating&#xD;
back when the subject of the amendment arises out of the&#xD;
same conduct, transaction, or occurrence described in the&#xD;
original pleading, does not alone help us to figure out what&#xD;
conduct, transaction, or occurrence is the same.&#xD;

                              II &#xD;
&#xD;
   Felix’s disputed right to amend with relation back effect&#xD;
turns entirely, as the Court says, ante, at 9, on how nar-&#xD;
rowly or how broadly the tripartite authorization for rela-&#xD;
tion back ought to be construed: whether the relevant&#xD;
“conduct, transaction, or occurrence”1 to which a habeas&#xD;
petition refers includes the underlying trial (which re-&#xD;
sulted in the custody being challenged) or is limited to the&#xD;
set of facts underlying each trial ruling claimed to be&#xD;
constitutionally defective (in this case, the unconfronted&#xD;
videotaped testimony and the interrogation that produced&#xD;
the incriminating statement). If the former, a habeas&#xD;
petitioner will have the benefit of relation back for any&#xD;
amendment raising trial error, subject to the district&#xD;
judge’s discretion to deny leave except for the one amend-&#xD;
ment of right; if the latter, a petitioner is effectively pre-&#xD;
cluded from making any amendment unless a single trial&#xD;
ruling amounts to distinct errors or an underlying fact is&#xD;
the subject of distinct rulings, notwithstanding Congress’s&#xD;
evident intent to provide relation back in habeas proceed-&#xD;
ings, see 28 U. S. C. §2242; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 81(a)(2);&#xD;
Habeas Corpus Rule 11.&#xD;
   The text alone does not tell us the answer, for either the&#xD;
facts specific to the claim or the trial as a whole could be&#xD;
the relevant “conduct, transaction, or occurrence.” The&#xD;
Court assumes that the former approach is correct and&#xD;
then proceeds to explain, based on that assumption, the&#xD;
infirmity of a contrary approach. For example, the Court&#xD;
asserts that under Felix’s rule, “all manner of factually&#xD;
and temporally unrelated conduct may be raised after the&#xD;
statute of limitations has run . . . .” Ante, at 11, n. 6. But&#xD;
in saying this the Court presumes that the relevant trans-&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  1 There is a tendency toward the gestalt in reading the phrase, but&#xD;
&#xD;
the three items are distinct, and a party claiming the benefit of the rule&#xD;
need satisfy only one.&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
action is what occurred outside the courtroom. Felix’s&#xD;
entire argument is that the proper transaction is instead&#xD;
what occurred in court, namely the imposition of the con-&#xD;
viction that justifies the challenged custody. If he is right,&#xD;
then the Court’s assertion is incorrect, for what Felix&#xD;
seeks to add is a claim not about “factually and temporally&#xD;
unrelated conduct,” ibid., but about conduct that occurred&#xD;
at the same trial as the conduct addressed in the initial&#xD;
petition. That newly addressed conduct will hardly be&#xD;
“temporally unrelated” to what was previously targeted; it&#xD;
likely will have occurred on the same day of trial as the&#xD;
original conduct or within a few days. Nor will it be “fac-&#xD;
tually . . . unrelated” to the previously raised in-court&#xD;
conduct, for it will almost certainly involve the same&#xD;
judge, the same parties and attorneys, the same court-&#xD;
room, and the same jurors. Again, my point is just that&#xD;
much of the Court’s argument lacks force because it as-&#xD;
sumes that the proper transaction is what occurred out-&#xD;
side the courtroom rather than inside, when that is the&#xD;
question we must answer.&#xD;
   The Court also cautions that “it would be anomalous to&#xD;
allow relation back under Rule 15(c)(2) based on a broader&#xD;
reading of the words ‘conduct, transaction, or occurrence’&#xD;
in federal habeas proceedings than in ordinary civil litiga-&#xD;
tion.” Ante, at 16. The cases the Court cites to establish&#xD;
the scope of civil relation back, however, see ante, at 10–&#xD;
13, simply stand for the proposition that an amendment&#xD;
relates back only if it deals with the same conduct, trans-&#xD;
action, or occurrence. Felix does not purport to claim&#xD;
anything more.2&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  2 In any event, it is not clear why it is more “capacious,” ante, at 11, to&#xD;
&#xD;
regard a single trial lasting days or weeks as one transaction or occur-&#xD;
rence than it is, for example, to view numerous separate protests filed&#xD;
with the Interstate Commerce Commission over a period of two years&#xD;
(each in response to a different proposed tariff amendment) as one&#xD;
transaction or occurrence, see Clipper Exxpress v. Rocky Mountain&#xD;

&#xD;
   At first glance, an argument for the narrow reading&#xD;
urged by petitioner Mayle inheres in the distinctive plead-&#xD;
ing requirement for habeas petitions. Unlike the generous&#xD;
notice-pleading standard for the benefit of ordinary civil&#xD;
plaintiffs under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), see&#xD;
Conley v. Gibson, 355 U. S. 41, 47 (1957), Habeas Corpus&#xD;
Rule 2(c) requires habeas petitioners to “specify all the&#xD;
grounds for relief available,” and to “state the facts support-&#xD;
ing each ground.” The Court implies that because pleading&#xD;
must be factually specific, the “conduct, transaction, or&#xD;
occurrence” of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c) must be&#xD;
specifically factual to a parallel degree; as the Court puts it,&#xD;
a habeas petitioner will plead claims “discretely,” ante, at&#xD;
14, such that each ground for relief “would delineate an&#xD;
‘occurrence,’ ” ante, at 15. But this does not follow; all that&#xD;
follows from “discret[e]” pleading is that each claim would&#xD;
delineate a separate ground for relief, whatever may be the&#xD;
conduct, transaction, or occurrence out of which the claims&#xD;
arise. As Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 323 U. S. 574&#xD;
(1945), and the other civil cases the Court cites demon-&#xD;
strate, see ante, at 11–13, relation back is regularly allowed&#xD;
when an amendment raises a separate claim for relief aris-&#xD;
ing out of the same transaction or occurrence, no matter&#xD;
how discretely that claim might be stated. Indeed, this is&#xD;

cited ante, at 11.&#xD;
   The Court responds that in Clipper Exxpress the amendment was&#xD;
“tied to the same operative facts as those initially alleged. ” Ante, at 11,&#xD;
n. 5. But as just noted, those “operative facts” (i.e., the relevant trans-&#xD;
action) consisted of a number of separate protests filed with the Inter-&#xD;
state Commerce Commission over a period of two years, each in re-&#xD;
sponse to a different proposed tariff amendment. This is, to say the&#xD;
least, a rather expansive transaction, much more so in my view than a&#xD;
single trial involving (for all claims stemming from it) the same judge,&#xD;
the same parties, the same attorneys, the same jury, the same indict-&#xD;
ment, and so on.&#xD;

&#xD;
what the text anticipates; Rule 15(c)(2) permits relation&#xD;
back when “the claim or defense” asserted in the amend-&#xD;
ment arises out of the same conduct, transaction, or occur-&#xD;
rence set forth in the original pleading. That is, the same&#xD;
conduct, transaction, or occurrence can support multiple,&#xD;
discrete claims for relief.&#xD;
   Nor is there any policy underlying the particular habeas&#xD;
pleading rule that requires a more grudging relation back&#xD;
standard. As the Court concedes, ante, at 9, the purpose of&#xD;
the heightened pleading standard in habeas cases is to&#xD;
help a district court weed out frivolous petitions before&#xD;
calling upon the State to answer. See Advisory Commit-&#xD;
tee’s Note on Habeas Corpus Rule 2, 28 U. S. C., p. 469;&#xD;
Advisory Committee Note on Rule 4, id., at 471 (“[I]t is the&#xD;

nothing to do with the effect of amendment to initial peti-&#xD;

amendment will require a district judge to examine one&#xD;
more item. But there is no claim here that Federal Rule of&#xD;

&#xD;
fact-pleading standard.3&#xD;
   While considerations based on habeas pleading fail to&#xD;
pan out with support for Mayle’s restricted reading of Rule&#xD;
15(c), several reasons convince me that Felix’s reading is&#xD;
right. Most obvious is the fact that both of his claims can&#xD;
easily fit within the same “transaction or occurrence,” un-&#xD;
derstood as a trial ending in conviction resulting in a single&#xD;
ultimate injury of unlawful custody. (“Conduct” sounds&#xD;
closer to underlying facts, perhaps, but Rule 15(c) turns on&#xD;
either conduct, transaction, or occurrence.) The Court&#xD;
acknowledges that Felix’s claims regarding his own interro-&#xD;
gation and the videotaped testimony of witness Kenneth&#xD;
Williams are potentially actionable here only because the&#xD;
resulting incriminating statements were introduced at trial,&#xD;
ante, at 14, but argues that they nevertheless arise out of&#xD;
separate transactions or occurrences because they rest on&#xD;
distinct “essential predicate[s],” ibid., meaning pretrial acts.&#xD;
It is certainly true that the claims depend on those distinct&#xD;
pretrial acts, but the claims depend equally on the specified&#xD;
trial errors, without which there would be no habeas claim:&#xD;
without the introduction of each set of statements at trial,&#xD;
Felix would have no argument for habeas relief, regardless&#xD;
of what happened outside of court.4 The Court’s own opin-&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  3 Neither  does the warning on the model habeas petition (that failure&#xD;
to set forth every ground for relief may preclude the presentation of&#xD;
additional grounds later) tell us anything about relation back. The&#xD;
Court implies that it does, ante, at 9, but the language on the form says&#xD;
nothing about relation back, and if the Court’s implication were correct&#xD;
then the warning would also bar amendments filed within the limita-&#xD;
tions period.&#xD;
   4 By contrast, use at trial of the fruits of the alleged police misconduct&#xD;
&#xD;
would not be a prerequisite to success in an action under Rev. Stat.&#xD;
§1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983, because such an action would indeed be&#xD;
challenging the conduct itself rather than the custody obtained by use&#xD;
at trial of the fruits of that conduct. Cf. ante, at 12 (citing Jackson v.&#xD;
Suffolk County Homicide Bureau, 135 F. 3d 254 (CA2 1998), where the&#xD;
Court of Appeals, in a §1983 case, concluded that two different in-&#xD;

&#xD;
ion demonstrates this, as its descriptions of Felix’s two&#xD;
claims refer not only to what happened outside court but&#xD;
also to what happened at trial, and they specifically ground&#xD;
the alleged constitutional violations on the latter. See ante,&#xD;
at 1 (“He initially alleged . . . that the admission into&#xD;
evidence of videotaped testimony of a witness for the&#xD;
prosecution violated his rights under the Sixth Amend-&#xD;

that, in the course of pretrial interrogation, the police used&#xD;
coercive tactics to obtain damaging statements from him,&#xD;
and that admission of those statements at trial violated&#xD;
his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination”).5&#xD;
Moreover, habeas review will of course look at more of the&#xD;
underlying trial record than just the ruling admitting the&#xD;
disputed evidence, for Felix’s claims like a great many&#xD;
others will call for examining the trial record as a whole for&#xD;
signs of requisite prejudice or reversible error.6 Here, for&#xD;
——————&#xD;
stances of postarrest police conduct were not part of a single transac-&#xD;
tion or occurrence). The Court’s analysis thus lies in some tension with&#xD;
our understanding that the signal, defining feature setting habeas&#xD;
cases apart from other tort claims against the State is that they “neces-&#xD;
sarily demonstrat[e] the invalidity of the conviction,” Heck v. Humphrey,&#xD;
512 U. S. 477, 481–482 (1994); see generally Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544&#xD;
U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 3–7).&#xD;
   5 There are other examples of the Court’s describing Felix’s claims&#xD;
&#xD;
with reference to the trial. See ante, at 3 (“Felix’s Fifth Amendment&#xD;
claim rested on the prosecution’s introduction of statements Felix made&#xD;
during pretrial police interrogation. . . . His Sixth Amendment claim&#xD;
related to the admission of the videotaped statements prosecution&#xD;
witness Kenneth Williams made at a jailhouse interview”); ante, at 4&#xD;
(“On direct appeal, Felix urged . . . that the admission of Williams’&#xD;
videotaped statements violated Felix’s constitutional right to confront&#xD;
the witnesses against him. He did not, however, argue that admission&#xD;
of his own pretrial statements violated his right to protection against&#xD;
self-incrimination”).&#xD;
   6 See Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 18 (1999) (“The erroneous&#xD;

example, if a court were to conclude that introducing Felix’s&#xD;
statements did violate the Fifth Amendment, relief would&#xD;
still turn on whether the error was harmless. This would&#xD;
call for a careful look at the other evidence admitted at trial,&#xD;
including the statements said to have come in contrary to&#xD;
the Confrontation Clause. In sum, Felix’s claims are not&#xD;
outside the text of Rule 15(c)(2).&#xD;
   Then there are a number of indications that Congress&#xD;
would not want the rule read narrowly, the first centering&#xD;
on the word “transaction.” That term not only goes to the&#xD;
breadth of relation back, but also to the scope of claim&#xD;
preclusion. E.g., Kremer v. Chemical Constr. Corp., 456&#xD;
U. S. 461, 482, n. 22 (1982) (“Res judicata has recently&#xD;
been taken to bar claims arising from the same transac-&#xD;
tion even if brought under different statutes . . .”); accord,&#xD;
1 Restatement (Second) of Judgments §24(1) (1980) (“[T]he&#xD;
claim extinguished includes all rights . . . with respect to&#xD;
all or any part of the transaction, or series of connected&#xD;
transactions, out of which the action arose”). For purposes&#xD;
of claim preclusion in habeas cases, the scope of “transac-&#xD;
tion” is crucial in applying AEDPA’s limitation on second&#xD;
or successive petitions: with very narrow exceptions,&#xD;
federal habeas limits a prisoner to only one petition chal-&#xD;

determining the jury’s verdict” (internal quotation marks omitted)); see&#xD;

include showing of prejudice); Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U. S. 637,&#xD;
643 (1974) (improper prosecutorial comment not reversible error unless&#xD;
remarks “so infec[t] the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting&#xD;
conviction a denial of due process”); Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.&#xD;
668, 695 (1984) (to find prejudice for purposes of ineffective assistance&#xD;

lenging his conviction or sentence.        See 28 U. S. C.&#xD;
§2244(b)(1). 7 The provisions limiting second or successive&#xD;
&#xD;
habeas petitions regard the relevant “transaction” for&#xD;
purposes of habeas claim preclusion as the trial that&#xD;
yielded the conviction or sentence under attack; once a&#xD;
challenge to that conviction or sentence has been rejected,&#xD;
other challenges are barred even if they raise different&#xD;
claims. By contrast, under the Court’s view of Rule 15(c)&#xD;
that the relevant “transaction” is the facts or conduct&#xD;
underlying each discrete claim, a prisoner should be al-&#xD;
lowed to file a second habeas petition so long as it is based&#xD;
on different underlying facts or conduct (i.e., on what the&#xD;
Court considers a separate “transaction”). The Court thus&#xD;
adopts, for purposes of relation back in habeas cases, a&#xD;
definition of “transaction” different from the one Congress&#xD;
apparently intended for purposes of claim preclusion in&#xD;
habeas cases. Judge Easterbrook explained this tension in&#xD;
Ellzey v. United States, 324 F. 3d 521 (CA7 2003), and the&#xD;
Court offers no evidence that Congress would have de-&#xD;
creed any such apparent anomaly within the body of ha-&#xD;
beas standards.8&#xD;
  There is, rather, a fair indication that Congress would&#xD;
have intended otherwise, in the fact that it has already&#xD;
placed limits on the right of some habeas petitioners to&#xD;

  7 The Court asserts that my argument here “builds . . . on an appar-&#xD;
&#xD;
ent assumption that claim preclusion operates in habeas cases largely&#xD;
as it does in mine-run civil cases.” Ante, at 15, n. 6. In actuality, the&#xD;
argument rests only on a fact we have previously recognized: that&#xD;
AEDPA’s “restrictions on successive petitions constitute a modified res&#xD;
judicata rule . . . .” Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 664 (1996).&#xD;
  8 The Court is mistaken in stating that I “would read Rule 15(c)(2)’s&#xD;
&#xD;
words, ‘conduct, transaction, or occurrence,’ into . . . 28 U. S. C.&#xD;
§§2244(b) and 2255, ¶8 . . . .” Ante, at 15, n. 6. What I would do is&#xD;
adopt, for purposes of reconciling Rule 15(c)(2) with AEDPA’s one-year&#xD;
statute of limitations, a definition of “transaction” that is consistent&#xD;
with what other sections of AEDPA, those governing second or succes-&#xD;
sive petitions, functionally regard as the relevant “transaction.”&#xD;

amend their petitions. In Chapter 154 of Title 28, provid-&#xD;
ing special procedures for habeas cases brought by peti-&#xD;
tioners subject to capital sentences in certain States,&#xD;
Congress specifically prohibited amendment of the origi-&#xD;
nal habeas petitions after the filing of the answer, except&#xD;
on the grounds specified for second or successive petitions&#xD;
under 28 U. S. C. §2244(b). See §2266(b)(3)(B). Congress’s&#xD;
intent to limit capital petitioners’ opportunity to amend&#xD;
(and thus to take advantage of relation back) makes sense&#xD;
owing to capital petitioners’ incentive for delay, but the&#xD;
provision it enacted also helps us make sense of Rule 15(c)&#xD;
in the usual habeas case where a prisoner has no incentive&#xD;
to string the process out. For Congress has shown not&#xD;
only that it knows how to limit amendment in habeas&#xD;
cases, but also that it specifically considered the subject of&#xD;
limiting amendment in such cases and chose not to limit&#xD;
amendment in the ordinary ones.&#xD;
   The final reason to view the trial as the relevant “trans-&#xD;
action” in Rule 15(c)(2) lies in the real consequences of&#xD;
today’s decision, which will fall most heavily on the shoul-&#xD;
ders of indigent habeas petitioners who can afford no&#xD;
counsel without the assistance of the court. In practical&#xD;
terms, the significance of the right to amend arises from&#xD;
the fact that in the overwhelming majority of cases, the&#xD;
original petition is the work of a pro se petitioner. See&#xD;
Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 191 (2001) (BREYER, J.,&#xD;
dissenting) (93% of habeas petitioners in study were pro se&#xD;
(citing U. S. Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs,&#xD;
Bureau of Justice Statistics, Federal Habeas Corpus Re-&#xD;
view: Challenging State Court Criminal Convictions 14&#xD;
(1995))); 1 Hertz &amp; Liebman, §12.2, at 601 (“[N]early all”&#xD;
federal habeas petitioners commence proceedings either&#xD;
without legal assistance or with only the aid of a fellow&#xD;
inmate or a volunteer attorney). Unless required by stat-&#xD;
ute, appointment of counsel is most often a matter of&#xD;
discretion on the part of the court. The district judge may&#xD;

&#xD;
                          SOUTER, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
well choose not to exercise that discretion unless and until&#xD;
a habeas proceeding advances to the stage of discovery or&#xD;
evidentiary hearing. See Habeas Corpus Rule 6(a) (requir-&#xD;
ing appointment of counsel for indigent petitioner “[i]f&#xD;
necessary for effective discovery”); Rule 8(c) (requiring&#xD;
appointment of counsel “[i]f an evidentiary hearing is&#xD;
warranted”). And the judge almost certainly will not&#xD;
appoint counsel until after the preliminary review of the&#xD;
petition to see whether it plainly warrants dismissal. See&#xD;
Rule 4. Where a petition (even in its pro se form) has&#xD;
survived this review by showing enough merit to justify&#xD;
appointing counsel, it makes no sense to say that counsel&#xD;
(appointed because of that apparent merit) should be&#xD;
precluded from exercising professional judgment when&#xD;
that judgment calls for adding a new ground for relief that&#xD;
would relate back to the filing of the original petition. For&#xD;
by hobbling counsel this way, the Court limits the capacity&#xD;
of appointed counsel to provide the professional service&#xD;
that a paid lawyer, hired at the outset, can give a client.&#xD;
The lawyer hired at the start of the proceeding will be able&#xD;
to draft an original petition containing all the claims&#xD;
revealed to his trained eye; if the same lawyer is ap-&#xD;
pointed by the court only after the petitioner has demon-&#xD;
strated some merit in an original pro se filing, he and his&#xD;
prisoner client will have no right to state all claims by&#xD;
adding to the original petition, unless the lawyer happens&#xD;
to be appointed and able to get up to speed before the&#xD;
statute of limitations runs out. The rule the Court adopts&#xD;
today may not make much difference to prisoners with&#xD;
enough money to hire their own counsel; but it will matter&#xD;
a great deal to poor prisoners who need appointed counsel&#xD;
to see and plead facts showing a colorable basis for relief. 9&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  9 It is not that I see the Court’s rule as constitutionally troubling. But&#xD;
&#xD;
this case requires us to apply text that is ambiguous, and the Court’s&#xD;
resolution of that ambiguity is based on the assumption that when&#xD;

——————&#xD;
Congress authorized the appointment of counsel in habeas cases, it&#xD;
would have intended the appointed lawyer to have one hand tied&#xD;
behind his back, as compared with an attorney hired by a prisoner with&#xD;
money. That is not in my view a sound assumption. (The Court also&#xD;
observes that in this case counsel had plenty of time to file an amended&#xD;
petition, but that fact cannot drive this decision, for the rule the Court&#xD;
adopts today will of course apply in cases other than this one.)&#xD;
