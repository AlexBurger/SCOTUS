   ESTATE OF MILLENDER, DECEASED, ET AL.&#xD;
&#xD;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&#xD;
                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT&#xD;
&#xD;
  No. 10–704.     Argued December 5, 2011—Decided February 22, 2012&#xD;
Shelly Kelly was afraid that she would be attacked by her boyfriend,&#xD;
  Jerry Ray Bowen, while she moved out of her apartment. She there-&#xD;
  fore requested police protection. Two officers arrived, but they were&#xD;
  called away to an emergency. As soon as the officers left, Bowen&#xD;
  showed up at the apartment, yelled “I told you never to call the cops&#xD;
  on me bitch!” and attacked Kelly, attempting to throw her over a se-&#xD;
  cond-story landing. After Kelly escaped to her car, Bowen pointed a&#xD;
  sawed-off shotgun at her and threatened to kill her if she tried to&#xD;
  leave. Kelly nonetheless sped away as Bowen fired five shots at the&#xD;
  car, blowing out one of its tires.&#xD;
     Kelly later met with Detective Curt Messerschmidt to discuss the&#xD;
  incident. She described the attack in detail, mentioned that Bowen&#xD;
  had previously assaulted her, that he had ties to the Mona Park&#xD;
  Crips gang, and that he might be staying at the home of his former&#xD;
  foster mother, Augusta Millender. Following this conversation, Mes-&#xD;
  serschmidt conducted a detailed investigation, during which he con-&#xD;
  firmed Bowen’s connection to the Millenders’ home, verified his&#xD;
  membership in two gangs, and learned that Bowen had been arrested&#xD;
  and convicted for numerous violent and firearm-related offenses.&#xD;
  Based on this investigation, Messerschmidt drafted an application&#xD;
  for a warrant authorizing a search of the Millenders’ home for all&#xD;
  firearms and ammunition, as well as evidence indicating gang&#xD;
  membership.&#xD;
     Messerschmidt included two affidavits in the warrant application.&#xD;
  The first detailed his extensive law enforcement experience and his&#xD;
  specialized training in gang-related crimes. The second, expressly in-&#xD;
  corporated into the search warrant, described the incident and ex-&#xD;
2                  MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER&#xD;
&#xD;
                                 Syllabus&#xD;
&#xD;
    plained why Messerschmidt believed there was probable cause for the&#xD;
    search. It also requested that the warrant be endorsed for night ser-&#xD;
    vice because of Bowen’s gang ties. Before submitting the application&#xD;
    to a magistrate for approval, Messerschmidt had it reviewed by his&#xD;
    supervisor, Sergeant Robert Lawrence, as well as a police lieutenant&#xD;
    and a deputy district attorney. Messerschmidt then submitted the&#xD;
    application to a magistrate, who issued the warrant. The ensuing&#xD;
    search uncovered only Millender’s shotgun, a California Social Ser-&#xD;
    vices letter addressed to Bowen, and a box of .45-caliber ammunition.&#xD;
       The Millenders filed an action under 42 U. S. C. §1983 against pe-&#xD;
    titioners Messerschmidt and Lawrence, alleging that the officers had&#xD;
    subjected them to an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth&#xD;
    Amendment. The District Court granted summary judgment to the&#xD;
    Millenders, concluding that the firearm and gang-material aspects of&#xD;
    the search warrant were overbroad and that the officers were not en-&#xD;
    titled to qualified immunity from damages. The Ninth Circuit, sit-&#xD;
    ting en banc, affirmed the denial of qualified immunity. The court&#xD;
    held that the warrant’s authorization was unconstitutionally over-&#xD;
    broad because the affidavits and warrant failed to establish probable&#xD;
    cause that the broad categories of firearms, firearm-related material,&#xD;
    and gang-related material were contraband or evidence of a crime,&#xD;
    and that a reasonable officer would have been aware of the warrant’s&#xD;
    deficiency.&#xD;
Held: The officers are entitled to qualified immunity. Pp. 8−19.&#xD;
    (a) Qualified immunity “protects government officials ‘from liability&#xD;
 for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly es-&#xD;
 tablished statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable&#xD;
 person would have known.’ ” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 231.&#xD;
 Where the alleged Fourth Amendment violation involves a search or&#xD;
 seizure pursuant to a warrant, the fact that a neutral magistrate has&#xD;
 issued a warrant is the clearest indication that the officers acted in&#xD;
 an objectively reasonable manner, or in “objective good faith.” United&#xD;
 States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 922–923. Nonetheless, that fact does&#xD;
 not end the inquiry into objective reasonableness. The Court has rec-&#xD;
 ognized an exception allowing suit when “it is obvious that no rea-&#xD;
 sonably competent officer would have concluded that a warrant&#xD;
 should issue.” Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 341. The “shield of&#xD;
 immunity” otherwise conferred by the warrant, id., at 345, will be&#xD;
 lost, for example, where the warrant was “based on an affidavit so&#xD;
 lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its&#xD;
 existence entirely unreasonable.” Leon, 468 U. S., at 923. The&#xD;
 threshold for establishing this exception is high. “[I]n the ordinary&#xD;
 case, an officer cannot be expected to question the magistrate’s prob-&#xD;
 able-cause determination” because “[i]t is the magistrate’s responsi-&#xD;
                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3&#xD;
&#xD;
                              Syllabus&#xD;
&#xD;
bility to determine whether the officer’s allegations establish proba-&#xD;
ble cause and, if so, to issue a warrant comporting in form with the&#xD;
requirements of the Fourth Amendment.” Leon, supra, at 921. Pp.&#xD;
8−10.&#xD;
   (b) This case does not fall within that narrow exception. It would&#xD;
not be entirely unreasonable for an officer to believe that there was&#xD;
probable cause to search for all firearms and firearm-related materi-&#xD;
als. Under the circumstances set forth in the warrant, an officer&#xD;
could reasonably conclude that there was a “fair probability” that the&#xD;
sawed-off shotgun was not the only firearm Bowen owned, Illinois v.&#xD;
Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 238, and that Bowen’s sawed-off shotgun was il-&#xD;
legal. Cf. 26 U. S. C. §§ 5845(a), 5861(d). Given Bowen’s possession&#xD;
of one illegal gun, his gang membership, willingness to use the gun to&#xD;
kill someone, and concern about the police, it would not be unreason-&#xD;
able for an officer to conclude that Bowen owned other illegal guns.&#xD;
An officer also could reasonably believe that seizure of firearms was&#xD;
necessary to prevent further assaults on Kelly. California law allows&#xD;
a magistrate to issue a search warrant for items “in the possession of&#xD;
any person with the intent to use them as a means of committing a&#xD;
public offense,” Cal. Penal Code Ann. §1524(a)(3), and the warrant&#xD;
application submitted by the officers specifically referenced this pro-&#xD;
vision as a basis for the search. Pp. 10–12.&#xD;
   (c) Regarding the warrant’s authorization to search for gang-&#xD;
related materials, a reasonable officer could view Bowen’s attack as&#xD;
motivated not by the souring of his romantic relationship with Kelly&#xD;
but by a desire to prevent her from disclosing details of his gang ac-&#xD;
tivity to the police. It would therefore not be unreasonable—based on&#xD;
the facts set out in the affidavit—for an officer to believe that evi-&#xD;
dence of Bowen’s gang affiliation would prove helpful in prosecuting&#xD;
him for the attack on Kelly, in supporting additional, related charges&#xD;
against Bowen for the assault, or in impeaching Bowen or rebutting&#xD;
his defenses. Moreover, even if this were merely a domestic dispute,&#xD;
a reasonable officer could still conclude that gang paraphernalia&#xD;
found at the Millenders’ residence could demonstrate Bowen’s control&#xD;
over the premises or his connection to other evidence found there.&#xD;
Pp. 12−16.&#xD;
   (d) The fact that the officers sought and obtained approval of the&#xD;
warrant application from a superior and a deputy district attorney&#xD;
before submitting it to the magistrate provides further support for&#xD;
the conclusion that an officer could reasonably have believed that the&#xD;
scope of the warrant was supported by probable cause. A contrary&#xD;
conclusion would mean not only that Messerschmidt and Lawrence&#xD;
were “plainly incompetent” in concluding that the warrant was sup-&#xD;
ported by probable cause, Malley, supra, at 341, but that their super-&#xD;

                                  Syllabus&#xD;
&#xD;
    visor, the deputy district attorney, and the magistrate were as well.&#xD;
    Pp. 16−18.&#xD;
       (e) In holding that the warrant in this case was so obviously defec-&#xD;
    tive that no reasonable officer could have believed it to be valid, the&#xD;
    court below erred in relying on Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551.&#xD;
    There, officers who carried out a warrant-approved search were not&#xD;
    entitled to qualified immunity because the warrant failed to describe&#xD;
    any of the items to be seized and “even a cursory reading of the war-&#xD;
    rant” would have revealed this defect. Id., at 557. Here, in contrast,&#xD;
    any arguable defect would have become apparent only upon a close&#xD;
    parsing of the warrant application, and a comparison of the support-&#xD;
    ing affidavit to the terms of the warrant to determine whether the af-&#xD;
    fidavit established probable cause to search for all the items listed in&#xD;
    the warrant. Unlike in Groh, any error here would not be one that&#xD;
    “just a simple glance” would have revealed. Id. at 564. Pp. 18−19.&#xD;
620 F. 3d 1016, reversed.&#xD;

       ESTATE OF AUGUSTA MILLENDER,&#xD;
&#xD;
              DECEASED, ET AL. &#xD;
&#xD;
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&#xD;
&#xD;
            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&#xD;
&#xD;
                              [February 22, 2012]&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the&#xD;
Court.&#xD;
   Petitioner police officers conducted a search of respond-&#xD;
ents’ home pursuant to a warrant issued by a neutral&#xD;
magistrate. The warrant authorized a search for all guns&#xD;
and gang-related material, in connection with the investi-&#xD;
gation of a known gang member for shooting at his ex-&#xD;
girlfriend with a pistol-gripped sawed-off shotgun, because&#xD;
she had “call[ed] the cops” on him. App. 56. Respondents&#xD;
brought an action seeking to hold the officers personally&#xD;
liable under 42 U. S. C. §1983, alleging that the search&#xD;
violated their Fourth Amendment rights because there&#xD;
was not sufficient probable cause to believe the items&#xD;
sought were evidence of a crime. In particular, respond-&#xD;
ents argued that there was no basis to search for all&#xD;
guns simply because the suspect owned and had used a&#xD;
sawed-off shotgun, and no reason to search for gang mate-&#xD;
rial because the shooting at the ex-girlfriend for “call[ing]&#xD;
the cops” was solely a domestic dispute. The Court of&#xD;
2             MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the warrant was&#xD;
invalid, and that the officers were not entitled to immu-&#xD;
nity from personal liability because this invalidity was so&#xD;
obvious that any reasonable officer would have recognized&#xD;
it, despite the magistrate’s approval. We disagree and&#xD;
reverse.&#xD;
                               I&#xD;
&#xD;
                               A&#xD;
&#xD;
  Shelly Kelly decided to break off her romantic relation-&#xD;
ship with Jerry Ray Bowen and move out of her apart-&#xD;
ment, to which Bowen had a key. Kelly feared an attack&#xD;
from Bowen, who had previously assaulted her and had&#xD;
been convicted of multiple violent felonies. She therefore&#xD;
asked officers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s De-&#xD;
partment to accompany her while she gathered her things.&#xD;
Deputies from the Sheriff ’s Department came to assist&#xD;
Kelly but were called away to respond to an emergency&#xD;
before the move was complete.&#xD;
  As soon as the officers left, an enraged Bowen appeared&#xD;
at the bottom of the stairs to the apartment, yelling “I told&#xD;
you never to call the cops on me bitch!” App. 39, 56.&#xD;
Bowen then ran up the stairs to Kelly, grabbed her by her&#xD;
shirt, and tried to throw her over the railing of the second-&#xD;
story landing. When Kelly successfully resisted, Bowen&#xD;
bit her on the shoulder and attempted to drag her inside&#xD;
the apartment by her hair. Kelly again managed to escape&#xD;
Bowen’s grasp, and ran to her car. By that time, Bowen&#xD;
had retrieved a black sawed-off shotgun with a pistol grip.&#xD;
He ran in front of Kelly’s car, pointed the shotgun at her,&#xD;
and told Kelly that if she tried to leave he would kill her.&#xD;
Kelly leaned over, fully depressed the gas pedal, and sped&#xD;
away. Bowen fired at the car a total of five times, blowing&#xD;
out the car’s left front tire in the process, but Kelly man-&#xD;
aged to escape.&#xD;
  Kelly quickly located police officers and reported the&#xD;
                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          3&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
assault. She told the police what had happened—that&#xD;
Bowen had attacked her after becoming “angry because&#xD;
she had called the Sheriff’s Department”—and she men-&#xD;
tioned that Bowen was “an active member of the ‘Mona&#xD;
Park Crips,’ ” a local street gang. Id., at 39. Kelly also&#xD;
provided the officers with photographs of Bowen.&#xD;
   Detective Curt Messerschmidt was assigned to investi-&#xD;
gate the incident. Messerschmidt met with Kelly to obtain&#xD;
details of the assault and information about Bowen. Kelly&#xD;
described the attack and informed Messerschmidt that she&#xD;
thought Bowen was staying at his foster mother’s home&#xD;
at 2234 East 120th Street. Kelly also informed Messer-&#xD;
schmidt of Bowen’s previous assaults on her and of his&#xD;
gang ties.&#xD;
   Messerschmidt then conducted a background check on&#xD;
Bowen by consulting police records, California Depart-&#xD;
ment of Motor Vehicles records, and the “cal-gang” data-&#xD;
base. Based on this research, Messerschmidt confirmed&#xD;
Bowen’s connection to the 2234 East 120th Street address.&#xD;
He also confirmed that Bowen was an “active” member of&#xD;
the Mona Park Crips and a “secondary” member of the&#xD;
Dodge City Crips. Id., at 64. Finally, Messerschmidt&#xD;
learned that Bowen had been arrested and convicted for&#xD;
numerous violent and firearm-related offenses. Indeed, at&#xD;
the time of the investigation, Bowen’s “rapsheet” spanned&#xD;
over 17 printed pages, and indicated that he had been&#xD;
arrested at least 31 times. Nine of these arrests were for&#xD;
firearms offenses and six were for violent crimes, includ-&#xD;
ing three arrests for assault with a deadly weapon (fire-&#xD;
arm). Id., at 72–81.&#xD;
   Messerschmidt prepared two warrants: one to authorize&#xD;
Bowen’s arrest and one to authorize the search of 2234&#xD;
East 120th Street. An attachment to the search warrant&#xD;
described the property that would be the object of the&#xD;
search:&#xD;

&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
    “All handguns, rifles, or shotguns of any caliber, or&#xD;
    any firearms capable of firing ammunition, or fire-&#xD;
    arms or devices modified or designed to allow it [sic]&#xD;
    to fire ammunition. All caliber of ammunition, miscel-&#xD;
    laneous gun parts, gun cleaning kits, holsters which&#xD;
    could hold or have held any caliber handgun being&#xD;
    sought. Any receipts or paperwork, showing the pur-&#xD;
    chase, ownership, or possession of the handguns being&#xD;
    sought. Any firearm for which there is no proof of&#xD;
    ownership. Any firearm capable of firing or cham-&#xD;
    bered to fire any caliber ammunition.&#xD;
    “Articles of evidence showing street gang membership&#xD;
    or affiliation with any Street Gang to include but not&#xD;
    limited to any reference to ‘Mona Park Crips’, includ-&#xD;
    ing writings or graffiti depicting gang membership,&#xD;
    activity or identity. Articles of personal property&#xD;
    tending to establish the identity of person [sic] in con-&#xD;
    trol of the premise or premises. Any photographs or&#xD;
    photograph albums depicting persons, vehicles, weap-&#xD;
    ons or locations, which may appear relevant to gang&#xD;
    membership, or which may depict the item being&#xD;
    sought and or believed to be evidence in the case being&#xD;
    investigated on this warrant, or which may depict ev-&#xD;
    idence of criminal activity. Additionally to include&#xD;
    any gang indicia that would establish the persons be-&#xD;
    ing sought in this warrant, affiliation or membership&#xD;
    with the ‘Mona Park Crips’ street gang.” Id., at 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
  Two affidavits accompanied Messerschmidt’s warrant ap-&#xD;
plications. The first affidavit described Messerschmidt’s&#xD;
extensive law enforcement experience, including that he&#xD;
had served as a peace officer for 14 years, that he was&#xD;
then assigned to a “specialized unit” “investigating gang&#xD;
related crimes and arresting gang members for various&#xD;
violations of the law,” that he had been involved in “hun-&#xD;
                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           5&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
dreds of gang related incidents, contacts, and or arrests”&#xD;
during his time on the force, and that he had “received&#xD;
specialized training in the field of gang related crimes”&#xD;
and training in “gang related shootings.” Id., at 53–54.&#xD;
   The second affidavit—expressly incorporated into the&#xD;
search warrant—explained why Messerschmidt believed&#xD;
there was sufficient probable cause to support the war-&#xD;
rant. That affidavit described the facts of the incident&#xD;
involving Kelly and Bowen in great detail, including the&#xD;
weapon used in the assault. The affidavit recounted that&#xD;
Kelly had identified Bowen as the assailant and that she&#xD;
thought Bowen might be found at 2234 East 120th Street.&#xD;
It also reported that Messerschmidt had “conducted an&#xD;
extensive background search on the suspect by utilizing&#xD;
departmental records, state computer records, and other&#xD;
police agency records,” and that from that information he&#xD;
had concluded that Bowen resided at 2234 East 120th&#xD;
Street. Id., at 58.&#xD;
   The affidavit requested that the search warrant be&#xD;
endorsed for night service because “information provided&#xD;
by the victim and the cal-gang data base” indicated that&#xD;
Bowen had “gang ties to the Mona Park Crip gang” and&#xD;
that “night service would provide an added element of&#xD;
safety to the community as well as for the deputy person-&#xD;
nel serving the warrant.” Id., at 59. The affidavit con-&#xD;
cluded by noting that Messerschmidt “believe[d] that the&#xD;
items sought” would be in Bowen’s possession and that&#xD;
“recovery of the weapon could be invaluable in the success-&#xD;
ful prosecution of the suspect involved in this case, and&#xD;
the curtailment of further crimes being committed.” Ibid.&#xD;
   Messerschmidt submitted the warrants to his super-&#xD;
visors—Sergeant Lawrence and Lieutenant Ornales—for&#xD;
review. Deputy District Attorney Janet Wilson also re-&#xD;
viewed the materials and initialed the search warrant,&#xD;
indicating that she agreed with Messerschmidt’s assess-&#xD;
ment of probable cause. Id., at 27, 47. Finally, Messer-&#xD;
6             MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER&#xD;
&#xD;
                    Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
schmidt submitted the warrants to a magistrate. The&#xD;
magistrate approved the warrants and authorized night&#xD;
service.&#xD;
  The search warrant was served two days later by a team&#xD;
of officers that included Messerschmidt and Lawrence.&#xD;
Sheriff’s deputies forced open the front door of 2234 East&#xD;
120th Street and encountered Augusta Millender—a&#xD;
woman in her seventies—and Millender’s daughter and&#xD;
grandson. As instructed by the police, the Millenders&#xD;
went outside while the residence was secured but re-&#xD;
mained in the living room while the search was conducted.&#xD;
Bowen was not found in the residence. The search did,&#xD;
however, result in the seizure of Augusta Millender’s&#xD;
shotgun, a California Social Services letter addressed to&#xD;
Bowen, and a box of .45-caliber ammunition.&#xD;
  Bowen was arrested two weeks later after Messer-&#xD;
schmidt found him hiding under a bed in a motel room.&#xD;
                             B&#xD;
   The Millenders filed suit in Federal District Court&#xD;
against the County of Los Angeles, the sheriff ’s depart-&#xD;
ment, the sheriff, and a number of individual officers,&#xD;
including Messerschmidt and Lawrence. The complaint&#xD;
alleged, as relevant here, that the search warrant was&#xD;
invalid under the Fourth Amendment. It sought damages&#xD;
from Messerschmidt and Lawrence, among others.&#xD;
   The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment&#xD;
on the validity of the search warrant. The District Court&#xD;
found the warrant defective in two respects. The District&#xD;
Court concluded that the warrant’s authorization to&#xD;
search for firearms was unconstitutionally overbroad&#xD;
because the “crime specified here was a physical assault&#xD;
with a very specific weapon”—a black sawed-off shotgun&#xD;
with a pistol grip—negating any need to “search for all&#xD;
firearms.” Millender v. County of Los Angeles, Civ. No.&#xD;

&#xD;
106, 157, 2007 WL 7589200, *21. The court also found&#xD;
the warrant overbroad with respect to the search for gang-&#xD;
related materials, because there “was no evidence that the&#xD;
crime at issue was gang-related.” App. to Pet. for Cert.&#xD;
157. As a result, the District Court granted summary&#xD;
judgment to the Millenders on their constitutional chal-&#xD;
lenges to the firearm and gang material aspects of the&#xD;
search warrant. Id., at 160. The District Court also re-&#xD;
jected the officers’ claim that they were entitled to quali-&#xD;
fied immunity from damages. Id., at 171.&#xD;
   Messerschmidt and Lawrence appealed, and a divided&#xD;
panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit re-&#xD;
versed the District Court’s denial of qualified immunity.&#xD;
564 F. 3d 1143 (2009). The court held that the officers&#xD;
were entitled to qualified immunity because “they reason-&#xD;
ably relied on the approval of the warrant by a deputy&#xD;
district attorney and a judge.” Id., at 1145.&#xD;
   The Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc and&#xD;
affirmed the District Court’s denial of qualified immunity.&#xD;
620 F. 3d 1016 (CA9 2010). The en banc court concluded&#xD;
that the warrant’s authorization was unconstitutionally&#xD;
overbroad because the affidavit and the warrant failed to&#xD;
“establish[ ] probable cause that the broad categories of&#xD;
firearms, firearm-related material, and gang-related&#xD;
material described in the warrant were contraband or&#xD;
evidence of a crime.” Id., at 1033. In the en banc court’s&#xD;
view, “the deputies had probable cause to search for a&#xD;
single, identified weapon . . . . They had no probable cause&#xD;
to search for the broad class of firearms and firearm-&#xD;
related materials described in the warrant.” Id., at 1027.&#xD;
In addition, “[b]ecause the deputies failed to establish any&#xD;
link between gang-related materials and a crime, the&#xD;
warrant authorizing the search and seizure of all gang-&#xD;
related evidence [was] likewise invalid.” Id., at 1031.&#xD;
Concluding that “a reasonable officer in the deputies’&#xD;
position would have been well aware of this deficiency,”&#xD;

&#xD;
                      Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
the en banc court held that the officers were not entitled to&#xD;
qualified immunity. Id., at 1033–1035.&#xD;
  There were two separate dissenting opinions. Judge&#xD;
Callahan determined that “the officers had probable cause&#xD;
to search for and seize any firearms in the home in which&#xD;
Bowen, a gang member and felon, was thought to reside.”&#xD;
Id., at 1036. She also concluded that “the officers reason-&#xD;
ably relied on their superiors, the district attorney, and&#xD;
the magistrate to correct” any overbreadth in the warrant,&#xD;
and that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity&#xD;
because their actions were not objectively unreasonable.&#xD;
Id., at 1044, 1049. Judge Silverman also dissented, con-&#xD;
cluding that the “deputies’ belief in the validity of . . . the&#xD;
warrant was entirely reasonable” and that the “record&#xD;
[wa]s totally devoid of any evidence that the deputies&#xD;
acted other than in good faith.” Id., at 1050. Judge Tall-&#xD;
man joined both dissents.&#xD;
  We granted certiorari. 564 U. S. ___ (2011).&#xD;
                              II&#xD;
  The Millenders allege that they were subjected to an&#xD;
unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amend-&#xD;
ment because the warrant authorizing the search of their&#xD;
home was not supported by probable cause. They seek&#xD;
damages from Messerschmidt and Lawrence for their roles&#xD;
in obtaining and executing this warrant. The validity of&#xD;
the warrant is not before us. The question instead is&#xD;
whether Messerschmidt and Lawrence are entitled to im-&#xD;
munity from damages, even assuming that the warrant&#xD;
should not have been issued.&#xD;
  “The doctrine of qualified immunity protects govern-&#xD;
ment officials ‘from liability for civil damages insofar as&#xD;
their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory&#xD;
or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person&#xD;
would have known.’ ” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223,&#xD;
231 (2009) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800,&#xD;

&#xD;
                         Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
818 (1982)). Qualified immunity “gives government offi-&#xD;
cials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken&#xD;
judgments,” and “protects ‘all but the plainly incompetent&#xD;
or those who knowingly violate the law.’ ” Ashcroft v. al-&#xD;
Kidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (quoting&#xD;
Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 341 (1986)). “[W]hether&#xD;
an official protected by qualified immunity may be held&#xD;
personally liable for an allegedly unlawful official action&#xD;
generally turns on the ‘objective legal reasonableness’ of&#xD;
the action, assessed in light of the legal rules that were&#xD;
‘clearly established’ at the time it was taken.” Anderson v.&#xD;
Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 639 (1987) (citation omitted).&#xD;
   Where the alleged Fourth Amendment violation involves&#xD;
a search or seizure pursuant to a warrant, the fact that a&#xD;
neutral magistrate has issued a warrant is the clearest&#xD;
indication that the officers acted in an objectively reason-&#xD;
able manner or, as we have sometimes put it, in “objective&#xD;
good faith.” United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 922–923&#xD;
(1984).1 Nonetheless, under our precedents, the fact that&#xD;
a neutral magistrate has issued a warrant authorizing the&#xD;
allegedly unconstitutional search or seizure does not end&#xD;
the inquiry into objective reasonableness. Rather, we&#xD;
have recognized an exception allowing suit when “it is&#xD;
obvious that no reasonably competent officer would have&#xD;
concluded that a warrant should issue.” Malley, 475 U. S.,&#xD;
at 341. The “shield of immunity” otherwise conferred by&#xD;
the warrant, id., at 345, will be lost, for example, where&#xD;
the warrant was “based on an affidavit so lacking in indi-&#xD;
cia of probable cause as to render official belief in its exist-&#xD;
——————&#xD;
   1 Although Leon involved the proper application of the exclusionary&#xD;
&#xD;
rule to remedy a Fourth Amendment violation, we have held that “the&#xD;
same standard of objective reasonableness that we applied in the con-&#xD;
text of a suppression hearing in Leon defines the qualified immun-&#xD;
ity accorded an officer” who obtained or relied on an allegedly invalid&#xD;
warrant. Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 344 (1986) (citation omitted);&#xD;
Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551, 565, n. 8 (2004).&#xD;

ence entirely unreasonable.” Leon, 468 U. S., at 923 (in-&#xD;
ternal quotation marks omitted).2&#xD;
   Our precedents make clear, however, that the threshold&#xD;
for establishing this exception is a high one, and it should&#xD;
be. As we explained in Leon, “[i]n the ordinary case, an&#xD;
officer cannot be expected to question the magistrate’s&#xD;
probable-cause determination” because “[i]t is the magis-&#xD;
trate’s responsibility to determine whether the officer’s&#xD;
allegations establish probable cause and, if so, to issue a&#xD;
warrant comporting in form with the requirements of the&#xD;
Fourth Amendment.” Id., at 921; see also Malley, supra,&#xD;
at 346, n. 9 (“It is a sound presumption that the magis-&#xD;
trate is more qualified than the police officer to make a&#xD;
probable cause determination, and it goes without saying&#xD;
that where a magistrate acts mistakenly in issuing a&#xD;
warrant but within the range of professional competence&#xD;
of a magistrate, the officer who requested the warrant&#xD;
cannot be held liable” (internal quotation marks and&#xD;
citation omitted)).&#xD;
                              III&#xD;
  The Millenders contend, and the Court of Appeals held,&#xD;
that their case falls into this narrow exception. According&#xD;
to the Millenders, the officers “failed to provide any facts&#xD;
or circumstances from which a magistrate could properly&#xD;
conclude that there was probable cause to seize the broad&#xD;
classes of items being sought,” and “[n]o reasonable officer&#xD;

Court and the Court of Appeals, post, at 8–9, 12. In contrast, the&#xD;
dissent cites the probable cause affidavit itself only twice. See post, at&#xD;
12. There is no contention before us that the affidavit was misleading&#xD;
in omitting any of the facts on which the dissent relies. Cf. Leon, 468&#xD;
U. S., at 923.&#xD;

                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
would have presumed that such a warrant was valid.”&#xD;
Brief for Respondents 27. We disagree.&#xD;
                              A&#xD;
   With respect to the warrant’s authorization to search for&#xD;
and seize all firearms, the Millenders argue that “a rea-&#xD;
sonably well-trained officer would have readily perceived&#xD;
that there was no probable cause to search the house for&#xD;
all firearms and firearm-related items.” Id., at 32. Noting&#xD;
that “the affidavit indicated exactly what item was evi-&#xD;
dence of a crime—the ‘black sawed off shotgun with a&#xD;
pistol grip,’ ” they argue that “[n]o facts established that&#xD;
Bowen possessed any other firearms, let alone that such&#xD;
firearms (if they existed) were ‘contraband or evidence of a&#xD;
crime.’ ” Ibid. (quoting App. 56).&#xD;
   Even if the scope of the warrant were overbroad in&#xD;
authorizing a search for all guns when there was infor-&#xD;
mation only about a specific one, that specific one was a&#xD;
sawed-off shotgun with a pistol grip, owned by a known&#xD;
gang member, who had just fired the weapon five times in&#xD;
public in an attempt to murder another person, on the&#xD;
asserted ground that she had “call[ed] the cops” on him.&#xD;
Id., at 56. Under these circumstances—set forth in the&#xD;
warrant—it would not have been unreasonable for an&#xD;
officer to conclude that there was a “fair probability” that&#xD;
the sawed-off shotgun was not the only firearm Bowen&#xD;
owned. Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 238 (1983). And&#xD;
it certainly would have been reasonable for an officer to&#xD;
assume that Bowen’s sawed-off shotgun was illegal. Cf. 26&#xD;
U. S. C. §§5845(a), 5861(d). Evidence of one crime is not&#xD;
always evidence of several, but given Bowen’s possession&#xD;
of one illegal gun, his gang membership, his willingness&#xD;
to use the gun to kill someone, and his concern about&#xD;
the police, a reasonable officer could conclude that there&#xD;
would be additional illegal guns among others that Bowen&#xD;

&#xD;
                          Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
owned.3&#xD;
   A reasonable officer also could believe that seizure of the&#xD;
firearms was necessary to prevent further assaults on&#xD;
Kelly. California law allows a magistrate to issue a search&#xD;
warrant for items “in the possession of any person with&#xD;
the intent to use them as a means of committing a public&#xD;
offense,” Cal. Penal Code Ann. §1524(a)(3) (West 2011),&#xD;
and the warrant application submitted by the officers&#xD;
specifically referenced this provision as a basis for the&#xD;
search. App. 48. Bowen had already attempted to murder&#xD;
Kelly once with a firearm, and had yelled “I’ll kill you” as&#xD;
she tried to escape from him. Id., at 56–57. A reasonable&#xD;
officer could conclude that Bowen would make another&#xD;
attempt on Kelly’s life and that he possessed other fire-&#xD;
arms “with the intent to use them” to that end. Cal. Penal&#xD;
Code Ann. §1524(a)(3).&#xD;
   Given the foregoing, it would not have been “entirely&#xD;
unreasonable” for an officer to believe, in the particular&#xD;
circumstances of this case, that there was probable cause&#xD;
to search for all firearms and firearm-related materials.&#xD;
Leon, supra, at 923 (internal quotation marks omitted).&#xD;
   With respect to the warrant’s authorization to search for&#xD;
evidence of gang membership, the Millenders contend that&#xD;
“no reasonable officer could have believed that the affida-&#xD;
vit presented to the magistrate contained a sufficient basis&#xD;
to conclude that the gang paraphernalia sought was con-&#xD;
traband or evidence of a crime.” Brief for Respondents 28.&#xD;
They argue that “the magistrate [could not] have reasona-&#xD;
bly concluded, based on the affidavit, that Bowen’s gang&#xD;
membership had anything to do with the crime under&#xD;
investigation” because “[t]he affidavit described a ‘spousal&#xD;

   3 The dissent caricatures our analysis as being that “because Bowen&#xD;
&#xD;
fired one firearm, it was reasonable for the police to conclude . . . that&#xD;
[he] must have possessed others,” post, at 10 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR,&#xD;
J.). This simply avoids coming to grips with the facts of the crime at&#xD;
issue.&#xD;

assault’ that ensued after Kelly decided to end her ‘on&#xD;
going dating relationship’ with Bowen” and “[n]othing in&#xD;
that description suggests that the crime was gang-&#xD;
related.” Ibid. (quoting App. 55).&#xD;
   This effort to characterize the case solely as a domes-&#xD;
tic dispute, however, is misleading.        Cf. post, at 5&#xD;
(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting); post, at 2 (KAGAN, J., concur-&#xD;
ring in part and dissenting in part). Messerschmidt began&#xD;
his affidavit in support of the warrant by explaining that&#xD;
he “has been investigating an assault with a deadly weap-&#xD;
on incident” and elaborated that the crime was a “spousal&#xD;
assault and an assault with a deadly weapon.” App. 55&#xD;
(emphasis added). The affidavit also stated that Bowen&#xD;
was “a known Mona Park Crip gang member” “based on&#xD;
information provided by the victim and the cal-gang data-&#xD;
base,”4 and that he had attempted to murder Kelly after&#xD;
becoming enraged that she had “call[ed] the cops on&#xD;
[him].” Id., at 56, 58–59. A reasonable officer could cer-&#xD;
tainly view Bowen’s attack as motivated not by the sour-&#xD;
ing of his romantic relationship with Kelly but instead by&#xD;
a desire to prevent her from disclosing details of his gang&#xD;
activity to the police. She was, after all, no longer linked&#xD;
with him as a girlfriend; he had assaulted her in the past;&#xD;
and she had indeed called the cops on him. And, as the&#xD;
affidavit supporting the warrant made clear, Kelly had in&#xD;
fact given the police information about Bowen’s gang ties.&#xD;
Id., at 59.5&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  4 Although the cal-gang database states that information contained&#xD;
&#xD;
therein cannot be used to establish probable cause, see App. 64, the&#xD;
affidavit makes clear that Kelly also provided this information to&#xD;
Messerschmidt, id., at 59, as she did to the deputies who initially&#xD;
responded to the attack, id., at 39 (describing Kelly’s statement that&#xD;
Bowen was “an active member of the ‘Mona Park Crips’ ”). We there-&#xD;
fore need not decide whether the cal-gang database’s disclaimer is&#xD;
relevant to Fourth Amendment analysis.&#xD;
  5 Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, see post, at 5–6, n. 5 (opinion&#xD;
&#xD;
of SOTOMAYOR, J.), the affidavit’s account of Bowen’s statements is&#xD;

&#xD;
                          Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
   It would therefore not have been unreasonable—based&#xD;
on the facts set out in the affidavit—for an officer to be-&#xD;
lieve that evidence regarding Bowen’s gang affiliation&#xD;
would prove helpful in prosecuting him for the attack on&#xD;
Kelly. See Warden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden, 387 U. S.&#xD;
294, 307 (1967) (holding that the Fourth Amendment&#xD;
allows a search for evidence when there is “probable cause&#xD;
. . . to believe that the evidence sought will aid in a partic-&#xD;
ular apprehension or conviction”). Not only would such&#xD;
evidence help to establish motive, either apart from or in&#xD;
addition to any domestic dispute, it would also support the&#xD;
bringing of additional, related charges against Bowen for&#xD;
the assault. See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. §136.1(b)(1)&#xD;
(West 1999) (It is a crime to “attempt[ ] to prevent or&#xD;
dissuade another person who has been the victim of a&#xD;
crime or who is witness to a crime from . . . [m]aking any&#xD;
report of that victimization to any . . . law enforcement&#xD;
officer”).6&#xD;
——————&#xD;
consistent with other accounts of the confrontation, in particular the&#xD;
report prepared by the officers who spoke with Kelly immediately after&#xD;
the attack. See App. 39 (stating that when Bowen “appeared at the&#xD;
base of the stairs and began yelling at [Kelly,] [h]e was angry because&#xD;
she had called the Sheriff ’s Department”). And at no point during this&#xD;
litigation has the accuracy of the affidavit’s account of the attack been&#xD;
called into question.&#xD;
   6 The dissent relies heavily on Messerschmidt’s deposition, in which&#xD;
&#xD;
he stated that Bowen’s crime was not a “gang crime.” See post, at 4–7.&#xD;
Messerschmidt’s belief about the nature of the crime, however, is not&#xD;
information he possessed but a conclusion he reached based on infor-&#xD;
mation known to him. See Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 641&#xD;
(1987). We have “eschew[ed] inquiries into the subjective beliefs of law&#xD;
enforcement officers who seize evidence pursuant to a subsequently&#xD;
invalidated warrant.” United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 922, n. 23&#xD;
(1984); see also Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 815–819 (1982). In&#xD;
any event, as the dissent recognizes, the inquiry under our precedents&#xD;
is whether “a reasonably well-trained officer in petitioner’s position&#xD;
would have known that his affidavit failed to establish probable cause.”&#xD;
Malley, 475 U. S., at 345 (emphasis added). Messerschmidt’s own&#xD;
evaluation does not answer the question whether it would have been&#xD;
                      Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    15&#xD;
&#xD;
                          Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
   In addition, a reasonable officer could believe that evi-&#xD;
dence demonstrating Bowen’s membership in a gang&#xD;
might prove helpful in impeaching Bowen or rebutting&#xD;
various defenses he could raise at trial. For example,&#xD;
evidence that Bowen had ties to a gang that uses guns&#xD;
such as the one he used to assault Kelly would certainly be&#xD;
relevant to establish that he had familiarity with or access&#xD;
to this type of weapon.&#xD;
   Moreover, even if this were merely a domestic dispute, a&#xD;
reasonable officer could still conclude that gang parapher-&#xD;
nalia found at the Millenders’ residence would aid in&#xD;
the prosecution of Bowen by, for example, demonstrating&#xD;
Bowen’s connection to other evidence found there. The&#xD;
warrant authorized a search for “any gang indicia that&#xD;
would establish the persons being sought in this warrant,”&#xD;
and “[a]rticles of personal property tending to establish&#xD;
the identity of [the] person in control of the premise or&#xD;
premises.” App. 52. Before the District Court, the Millen-&#xD;
ders “acknowledge[d] that evidence of who controlled the&#xD;
premises would be relevant if incriminating evidence were&#xD;
found and it became necessary to tie that evidence to a&#xD;
person, ” and the District Court approved that aspect of&#xD;
the warrant on this basis. App. to Pet. for Cert. 158–159&#xD;
(internal quotation marks omitted). Given Bowen’s known&#xD;
gang affiliation, a reasonable officer could conclude that&#xD;
gang paraphernalia found at the residence would be an&#xD;
effective means of demonstrating Bowen’s control over the&#xD;
premises or his connection to evidence found there.7&#xD;
——————&#xD;
unreasonable for an officer to have reached a different conclusion from&#xD;
the facts in the affidavit. See n. 2, supra.&#xD;
  7 The Fourth Amendment does not require probable cause to believe&#xD;
&#xD;
evidence will conclusively establish a fact before permitting a search,&#xD;
but only “probable cause . . . to believe the evidence sought will aid in a&#xD;
particular apprehension or conviction.” Warden, Md. Penitentiary v.&#xD;
Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 307 (1967) (emphasis added). Even if gang&#xD;
evidence might have turned out not to be conclusive because other&#xD;

&#xD;
                         Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
   Whatever the use to which evidence of Bowen’s gang&#xD;
involvement might ultimately have been put, it would not&#xD;
have been “entirely unreasonable” for an officer to believe&#xD;
that the facts set out in the affidavit established a fair&#xD;
probability that such evidence would aid the prosecution&#xD;
of Bowen for the criminal acts at issue. Leon, 468 U. S., at&#xD;
923 (internal quotation marks omitted).&#xD;
                              B&#xD;
   Whether any of these facts, standing alone or taken&#xD;
together, actually establish probable cause is a question&#xD;
we need not decide. Qualified immunity “gives govern-&#xD;
ment officials breathing room to make reasonable but&#xD;
mistaken judgments.” al-Kidd, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,&#xD;
at 12). The officers’ judgment that the scope of the war-&#xD;
rant was supported by probable cause may have been&#xD;
mistaken, but it was not “plainly incompetent.” Malley,&#xD;
475 U. S., at 341.&#xD;
   On top of all this, the fact that the officers sought and&#xD;
obtained approval of the warrant application from a supe-&#xD;
rior and a deputy district attorney before submitting it to&#xD;
the magistrate provides further support for the conclusion&#xD;
that an officer could reasonably have believed that the&#xD;
scope of the warrant was supported by probable cause.&#xD;
Ibid. Before seeking to have the warrant issued by a&#xD;
magistrate, Messerschmidt conducted an extensive inves-&#xD;
tigation into Bowen’s background and the facts of the&#xD;
crime. Based on this investigation, Messerschmidt pre-&#xD;
pared a detailed warrant application that truthfully laid&#xD;
——————&#xD;
members of the Millender household also had gang ties, see post, at 8&#xD;
(opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.); post, at 2–3 (opinion of KAGAN, J.), a rea-&#xD;
sonable officer could still conclude that evidence of gang membership&#xD;
would help show Bowen’s connection to the residence. Such evidence&#xD;
could, for example, have displayed Bowen’s gang moniker (“C Jay”)&#xD;
or could have been identified by Kelly as belonging to Bowen. See&#xD;
App. 64.&#xD;

                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
out the pertinent facts. The only facts omitted—the offi-&#xD;
cers’ knowledge of Bowen’s arrest and conviction records,&#xD;
see supra, at 3—would only have strengthened the war-&#xD;
rant. Messerschmidt then submitted the warrant applica-&#xD;
tion for review by Lawrence, another superior officer, and&#xD;
a deputy district attorney, all of whom approved the appli-&#xD;
cation without any apparent misgivings. Only after this&#xD;
did Messerschmidt seek the approval of a neutral magis-&#xD;
trate, who issued the requested warrant. The officers thus&#xD;
“took every step that could reasonably be expected of&#xD;
them.” Massachusetts v. Sheppard, 468 U. S. 981, 989&#xD;
(1984). In light of the foregoing, it cannot be said that “no&#xD;
officer of reasonable competence would have requested the&#xD;
warrant.” Malley, 475 U. S., at 346, n. 9. Indeed, a con-&#xD;
trary conclusion would mean not only that Messerschmidt&#xD;
and Lawrence were “plainly incompetent,” id., at 341, but&#xD;
that their supervisor, the deputy district attorney, and the&#xD;
magistrate were as well.&#xD;
   The Court of Appeals, however, gave no weight to the&#xD;
fact that the warrant had been reviewed and approved&#xD;
by the officers’ superiors, a deputy district attorney, and a&#xD;
neutral magistrate. Relying on Malley, the court held that&#xD;
the officers had an “independent responsibility to ensure&#xD;
there [was] at least a colorable argument for probable&#xD;
cause.” 620 F. 3d, at 1034. It explained that “[t]he depu-&#xD;
ties here had a responsibility to exercise their reasonable&#xD;
professional judgment,” and that “in circumstances such&#xD;
as these a neutral magistrate’s approval (and, a fortiori,&#xD;
a non-neutral prosecutor’s) cannot absolve an officer of&#xD;
liability.” Ibid. (citation omitted).&#xD;
   We rejected in Malley the contention that an officer is&#xD;
automatically entitled to qualified immunity for seeking a&#xD;
warrant unsupported by probable cause, simply because&#xD;
a magistrate had approved the application. 475 U. S., at&#xD;
345. And because the officers’ superior and the deputy&#xD;
district attorney are part of the prosecution team, their&#xD;
18            MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
review also cannot be regarded as dispositive. But by&#xD;
holding in Malley that a magistrate’s approval does not&#xD;
automatically render an officer’s conduct reasonable, we&#xD;
did not suggest that approval by a magistrate or review&#xD;
by others is irrelevant to the objective reasonableness of&#xD;
the officers’ determination that the warrant was valid.&#xD;
Indeed, we expressly noted that we were not deciding&#xD;
“whether [the officer’s] conduct in [that] case was in fact&#xD;
objectively reasonable.” Id., at 345, n. 8. The fact that the&#xD;
officers secured these approvals is certainly pertinent in&#xD;
assessing whether they could have held a reasonable belief&#xD;
that the warrant was supported by probable cause.&#xD;
                             C&#xD;
    In holding that the warrant in this case was so obvious-&#xD;
ly defective that no reasonable officer could have believed&#xD;
it was valid, the court below relied heavily on our decision&#xD;
in Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551 (2004), but that prece-&#xD;
dent is far afield. There, we held that officers who carried&#xD;
out a warrant-approved search were not entitled to quali-&#xD;
fied immunity because the warrant in question failed to&#xD;
describe the items to be seized at all. Id., at 557. We&#xD;
explained that “[i]n the portion of the form that called for&#xD;
a description of the ‘person or property’ to be seized, [the&#xD;
applicant] typed a description of [the target’s] two-story&#xD;
blue house rather than the alleged stockpile of firearms.”&#xD;
Id., at 554. Thus, the warrant stated nonsensically that&#xD;
“ ‘there is now concealed [on the specified premises] a&#xD;
certain person or property, namely [a] single dwelling&#xD;
residence two story in height which is blue in color and&#xD;
has two additions attached to the east.’ ” Id., at 554–555,&#xD;
n. 2 (bracketed material in original). Because “even a&#xD;
cursory reading of the warrant in [that] case—perhaps&#xD;
just a simple glance—would have revealed a glaring de-&#xD;
ficiency that any reasonable police officer would have&#xD;
known was constitutionally fatal,” id., at 564, we held that&#xD;
                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          19&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
the officer was not entitled to qualified immunity.&#xD;
   The instant case is not remotely similar. In contrast to&#xD;
Groh, any defect here would not have been obvious from&#xD;
the face of the warrant. Rather, any arguable defect&#xD;
would have become apparent only upon a close parsing of&#xD;
the warrant application, and a comparison of the affidavit&#xD;
to the terms of the warrant to determine whether the&#xD;
affidavit established probable cause to search for all the&#xD;
items listed in the warrant. This is not an error that&#xD;
“just a simple glance” would have revealed. Ibid. Indeed,&#xD;
unlike in Groh, the officers here did not merely submit&#xD;
their application to a magistrate. They also presented it&#xD;
for review by a superior officer, and a deputy district&#xD;
attorney, before submitting it to the magistrate. The fact&#xD;
that none of the officials who reviewed the application&#xD;
expressed concern about its validity demonstrates that&#xD;
any error was not obvious. Groh plainly does not control&#xD;
the result here.&#xD;
                        *    *     *&#xD;
  The question in this case is not whether the magistrate&#xD;
erred in believing there was sufficient probable cause to&#xD;
support the scope of the warrant he issued. It is instead&#xD;
whether the magistrate so obviously erred that any rea-&#xD;
sonable officer would have recognized the error. The&#xD;
occasions on which this standard will be met may be rare,&#xD;
but so too are the circumstances in which it will be appro-&#xD;
priate to impose personal liability on a lay officer in the&#xD;
face of judicial approval of his actions. Even if the war-&#xD;
rant in this case were invalid, it was not so obviously&#xD;
lacking in probable cause that the officers can be con-&#xD;
sidered “plainly incompetent” for concluding otherwise.&#xD;
Malley, supra, at 341. The judgment of the Court of Ap-&#xD;
peals denying the officers qualified immunity must there-&#xD;
fore be reversed.&#xD;

   JUSTICE BREYER, concurring.&#xD;
   The Court concludes that the officers acted reasonably&#xD;
in searching the house for “ ‘all firearms and firearm-&#xD;
related items.’ ” Ante, at 11–12 (emphasis deleted). In&#xD;
support of this conclusion, it cites two sets of circum-&#xD;
stances. First, the majority points to “Bowen’s possession&#xD;
of one illegal gun, his gang membership, his willingness to&#xD;
use the gun to kill someone, and his concern about the&#xD;
police . . . .” Ante, at 11. Second, the majority notes that&#xD;
“[a] reasonable officer also could believe that seizure of the&#xD;
firearms was necessary to prevent further assaults on&#xD;
Kelly,” because “Bowen had already attempted to murder&#xD;
Kelly once with a firearm, and had yelled ‘I’ll kill you’ as&#xD;
she tried to escape from him.” Ante, at 12. In my view,&#xD;
given all these circumstances together, the officers could&#xD;
reasonably have believed that the scope of their search&#xD;
was supported by probable cause. On that basis, I concur.&#xD;

&#xD;
                     [February 22, 2012]&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
   JUSTICE KAGAN, concurring in part and dissenting in&#xD;
part.&#xD;
   Both the Court and the dissent view this case as an&#xD;
all-or-nothing affair: The Court awards immunity across&#xD;
the board to Messerschmidt and his colleagues, while the&#xD;
dissent would grant them none at all. I think the right&#xD;
answer lies in between, although the Court makes the&#xD;
more far-reaching error.&#xD;
   I agree with the Court that a reasonably competent&#xD;
police officer could have thought this warrant valid in&#xD;
authorizing a search for all firearms and related items.&#xD;
See ante, at 11–12. The warrant application recounted&#xD;
that a known gang member had used a sawed-off shot-&#xD;
gun—an illegal weapon under California law, see Cal.&#xD;
Penal Code Ann. §33215 (West 2012 Cum. Supp.)—to try&#xD;
to kill another person. See App. 56–57, 59. Perhaps gang&#xD;
ties plus possession of an unlawful gun plus use of that&#xD;
gun to commit a violent assault do not add up to what was&#xD;
needed for this search: probable cause to believe that&#xD;
Bowen had additional illegal firearms (or legal firearms&#xD;
that he intended to use to violate the law) at the place he&#xD;
was staying. But because our and the Ninth Circuit’s&#xD;
decisions leave that conclusion debatable, a reasonable&#xD;
2             MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of KAGAN, J.&#xD;
&#xD;
police officer could have found the warrant adequately&#xD;
supported by “indicia of probable cause.” Malley v. Briggs,&#xD;
475 U. S. 335, 345 (1986). So Messerschmidt and his&#xD;
fellow officers should receive qualified immunity for their&#xD;
search for firearms.&#xD;
   The Court, however, goes astray when it holds that a&#xD;
reasonable officer could have thought the warrant valid in&#xD;
approving a search for evidence of “street gang member-&#xD;
ship,” App. 52. Membership in even the worst gang does&#xD;
not violate California law, so the officers could not search&#xD;
for gang paraphernalia just to establish Bowen’s ties to&#xD;
the Crips. Instead, the police needed probable cause to&#xD;
believe that such items would provide evidence of an&#xD;
actual crime—and as the Court acknowledges, see ante, at&#xD;
12–14, the only crime mentioned in the warrant applica-&#xD;
tion was the assault on Kelly. The problem for the Court&#xD;
is that nothing in the application supports a link between&#xD;
Bowen’s gang membership and that shooting. Contra the&#xD;
Court’s elaborate theory-spinning, see ante, at 12–16,&#xD;
Messerschmidt’s affidavit in fact characterized the violent&#xD;
assault only as a domestic dispute, not as a gang-related&#xD;
one, see App. 55 (describing the crime as a “spousal as-&#xD;
sault and an assault with a deadly weapon”). And that&#xD;
description is consistent with the most natural under-&#xD;
standing of the events. The warrant application thus had&#xD;
a hole at its very center: It lacked any explanation of how&#xD;
gang items would (or even might) provide evidence of the&#xD;
domestic assault the police were investigating.&#xD;
   To fill this vacuum, the Court proposes an alternative,&#xD;
but similarly inadequate justification—that gang para-&#xD;
phernalia could have demonstrated Bowen’s connection to&#xD;
the Millender residence and to any evidence of the assault&#xD;
found there. The dissent rightly notes one difficulty with&#xD;
this argument: The discovery of gang items would not&#xD;
have established that Bowen was staying at the house,&#xD;
given that several other gang members regularly did so.&#xD;
                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)             3&#xD;
&#xD;
                      Opinion of KAGAN, J.&#xD;
&#xD;
See post, at 8–9 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). And even&#xD;
setting that issue aside, the Court’s reasoning proves far&#xD;
too much: It would sanction equally well a search for any&#xD;
of Bowen’s possessions on the premises—a result impos-&#xD;
sible to square with the Fourth Amendment. See, e.g.,&#xD;
Andresen v. Maryland, 427 U. S. 463, 480 (1976) (disap-&#xD;
proving “ ‘a general, exploratory rummaging in a person’s&#xD;
belongings’ ” (quoting Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403&#xD;
U. S. 443, 467 (1971))). In authorizing a search for all&#xD;
gang-related items, the warrant far outstripped the offic-&#xD;
ers’ probable cause. Because a reasonable officer would&#xD;
have recognized that defect, I would not award qualified&#xD;
immunity to Messerschmidt and his colleagues for this&#xD;
aspect of their search.&#xD;
  Still more fundamentally, the Court errs in scolding the&#xD;
Court of Appeals for failing to give “weight to the fact that&#xD;
the warrant had been reviewed and approved by the offic-&#xD;
ers’ superiors, a deputy district attorney, and a neutral&#xD;
magistrate.” Ante, at 17. As the dissent points out,&#xD;
see post, at 13–15, this Court’s holding in Malley is to&#xD;
the opposite effect: An officer is not “entitled to rely on the&#xD;
judgment of a judicial officer in finding that probable&#xD;
cause exists and hence issuing the warrant.” 475 U. S., at&#xD;
345. Malley made clear that qualified immunity turned&#xD;
on the officer’s own “professional judgment,” considered&#xD;
separately from the mistake of the magistrate. Id., at 346;&#xD;
see ibid., n. 9 (“The officer . . . cannot excuse his own&#xD;
default by pointing to the greater incompetence of the&#xD;
magistrate”); id., at 350 (Powell, J., concurring in part and&#xD;
dissenting in part) (objecting to the Court’s decision to&#xD;
“give little evidentiary weight to the finding of probable&#xD;
cause by a magistrate”). And what we said in Malley&#xD;
about a magistrate’s authorization applies still more&#xD;
strongly to the approval of other police officers or state&#xD;
attorneys. All those individuals, as the Court puts it, are&#xD;
“part of the prosecution team.” Ante, at 18. To make their&#xD;

&#xD;
views relevant is to enable those teammates (whether&#xD;
acting in good or bad faith) to confer immunity on each&#xD;
other for unreasonable conduct—like applying for a war-&#xD;
rant without anything resembling probable cause.&#xD;
  For these reasons, I would reverse in part and affirm in&#xD;
part the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and I would&#xD;
remand this case for further proceedings.&#xD;

&#xD;
&#xD;
   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG&#xD;
joins, dissenting.&#xD;
   The fundamental purpose of the Fourth Amendment’s&#xD;
warrant clause is “to protect against all general searches.”&#xD;
Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 U. S. 344, 357&#xD;
(1931). The Fourth Amendment was adopted specifically&#xD;
in response to the Crown’s practice of using general war-&#xD;
rants and writs of assistance to search “suspected places”&#xD;
for evidence of smuggling, libel, or other crimes. Boyd v.&#xD;
United States, 116 U. S. 616, 625–626 (1886). Early patri-&#xD;
ots railed against these practices as “the worst instrument&#xD;
of arbitrary power” and John Adams later claimed that&#xD;
“the child Independence was born” from colonists’ opposi-&#xD;
tion to their use. Id., at 625 (internal quotation marks&#xD;
omitted).&#xD;
   To prevent the issue of general warrants on “loose,&#xD;
vague or doubtful bases of fact,” Go-Bart Importing Co.,&#xD;
282 U. S., at 357, the Framers established the inviolable&#xD;
principle that should resolve this case: “no Warrants shall&#xD;
issue, but upon probable cause . . . and particularly de-&#xD;
scribing the . . . things to be seized.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 4.&#xD;
That is, the police must articulate an adequate reason to&#xD;
search for specific items related to specific crimes.&#xD;
2              MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER&#xD;
&#xD;
                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
    In this case, police officers investigating a specific, non-&#xD;
gang-related assault committed with a specific firearm (a&#xD;
sawed-off shotgun) obtained a warrant to search for all&#xD;
evidence related to “any Street Gang,” “[a]ny photographs&#xD;
. . . which may depict evidence of criminal activity,” and&#xD;
“any firearms.” App. 52. They did so for the asserted&#xD;
reason that the search might lead to evidence related to&#xD;
other gang members and other criminal activity, and that&#xD;
other “[v]alid warrants commonly allow police to search&#xD;
for ‘firearms and ammunition.’ ” See infra, at 8–9. That&#xD;
kind of general warrant is antithetical to the Fourth&#xD;
Amendment.&#xD;
    The Court nonetheless concludes that the officers are&#xD;
entitled to qualified immunity because their conduct was&#xD;
“objectively reasonable.” I could not disagree more. All&#xD;
13 federal judges who previously considered this case&#xD;
had little difficulty concluding that the police officers’&#xD;
search for any gang-related material violated the Fourth&#xD;
Amendment. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 28–29, 45, n. 7,&#xD;
73, 94, 157–158. And a substantial majority agreed that&#xD;
the police’s search for both gang-related material and all&#xD;
firearms not only violated the Fourth Amendment, but&#xD;
was objectively unreasonable. Like them, I believe that&#xD;
any “reasonably well-trained officer in petitioner’s position&#xD;
would have known that his affidavit failed to establish&#xD;
probable cause.” Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 345&#xD;
(1986).&#xD;
    The Court also hints that a police officer’s otherwise&#xD;
unreasonable conduct may be excused by the approval of&#xD;
a magistrate, or more disturbingly, another police officer.&#xD;
Ante, at 16–18. That is inconsistent with our focus on the&#xD;
objective reasonableness of an officer’s decision to submit&#xD;
a warrant application to a magistrate, and we long ago&#xD;
rejected it. See Malley, 475 U. S., at 345–346.&#xD;
    The Court’s analysis bears little relationship to the&#xD;
record in this case, our precedents, or the purposes under-&#xD;

lying qualified immunity analysis. For all these reasons,&#xD;
I respectfully dissent.&#xD;
                             I&#xD;
   The Court holds that a well-trained officer could have&#xD;
reasonably concluded that there was probable cause to&#xD;
search the Millenders’ residence for any evidence of affilia-&#xD;
tion with “any Street Gang,” and “all handguns, rifles, or&#xD;
shotguns of any caliber, or any firearms capable of firing&#xD;
ammunition.” App. 52.1 I cannot agree.&#xD;
                              A&#xD;
   Most troubling is the Court’s determination that peti-&#xD;
tioners reasonably could have concluded that they had&#xD;
probable cause to search for all evidence of any gang affili-&#xD;
ation in the Millenders’ home. The Court reaches this&#xD;
result only by way of an unprecedented, post hoc recon-&#xD;
struction of the crime that wholly ignores the police’s own&#xD;
conclusions, as well as the undisputed facts presented to&#xD;
the District Court.&#xD;
   The Court primarily theorizes that “[a] reasonable of-&#xD;
ficer could certainly view Bowen’s attack as motivated&#xD;
not by the souring of his romantic relationship with Kelly&#xD;
but instead by a desire to prevent her from disclosing&#xD;
details of his gang activity to the police.” Ante, at 13. The&#xD;
majority therefore dismisses as “misleading” the Millen-&#xD;
ders’ characterization of the case as a “domestic dispute,”&#xD;
insisting that Detective Messerschmidt could have rea-&#xD;
sonably thought that the crime was gang related. See&#xD;
ante, at 13–14.2&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  1 Not even the Court defends the warrant’s authorization to search for&#xD;
&#xD;
“[a]ny photographs . . . which may depict evidence of criminal activity.”&#xD;
  2 The Court implies Detective Messerschmidt did not consider the&#xD;
&#xD;
crime “solely . . . a domestic dispute” because he labeled it a “spousal&#xD;
assault and an assault with a deadly weapon.” Ante, at 13 (internal&#xD;
quotation marks omitted). Solely domestic disputes often involve gun&#xD;
violence, however. See Sorenson &amp; Weibe, Weapons in the Lives of&#xD;
4                MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER&#xD;
&#xD;
                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
  The police flatly rejected that hypothesis, however, con-&#xD;
cluding that the crime was a domestic dispute that was&#xD;
not in any way gang related. Detective Messerschmidt’s&#xD;
deposition is illustrative.&#xD;
     “Q: So as far as you knew, it was just sort of a spousal-&#xD;
     abuse-type case where the perpetrator happened to be&#xD;
     in a gang, right?&#xD;
     “A: Correct.&#xD;
     “Q: So you didn’t have any reason to believe that the&#xD;
     assault on Kelly was any sort of gang crime, did you?&#xD;
     “A: No.” Record in No. CV 05–2298 DDP (RZx) (CD&#xD;
     Cal.) (hereinafter Record), Doc. 51, (Exh. X), p. 120&#xD;
     (hereinafter Deposition).3&#xD;
The “Crime Analysis” forms prepared by the police like-&#xD;
——————&#xD;
Battered Women, 94 Am. J. Pub. Health 1412, 1413 (2004) (noting&#xD;
more than one-third of female domestic violence shelter residents in&#xD;
California reported having been threatened or harmed with a firearm).&#xD;
That was the case here. In any event, the Court’s reading of Detective&#xD;
Messerschmidt’s affidavit is incompatible with his testimony that the&#xD;
crime was “just sort of a spousal-abuse-type case,” not a “gang crime.”&#xD;
See supra this page.&#xD;
  3 By suggesting that courts assessing qualified immunity should ig-&#xD;
&#xD;
nore police officers’ testimony about the information they possessed at&#xD;
the time of the search, ante, at 14–15, n. 6, the Court misreads Harlow&#xD;
v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 815–819 (1982), and Anderson v.&#xD;
Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 645 (1987). In Harlow, we adopted a qualified&#xD;
immunity test focusing on an officer’s objective good faith, rather than&#xD;
whether the officer searched “with the malicious intention to cause a&#xD;
deprivation of constitutional rights or other injury.” 457 U. S., at 815.&#xD;
As we have explained, “examination of the information possessed by the&#xD;
searching officials . . . does not reintroduce into qualified immunity&#xD;
analysis the inquiry into officials’ subjective intent that Harlow sought&#xD;
to minimize.” Anderson, 483 U. S., at 641. It is therefore highly&#xD;

wise identified Bowen as a “Mona Park Crip” gang mem-&#xD;
ber, but did not check off “gang-related” as a motive for the&#xD;
attack. See App. 41, 44 (Crime Analysis Supplemental&#xD;
Form–M. O. Factors). And the District Court noted it was&#xD;
undisputed that Detective Messerschmidt “had no reason&#xD;
to believe Bowen’s crime was a ‘gang’ crime.” App. to Pet.&#xD;
for Cert. 115.4&#xD;
   The police’s conclusions matched the victim’s own ac-&#xD;
count of the attack. Kelly asked police officers to help her&#xD;
move out because Bowen “ha[d] a domestic violence on his&#xD;
record,” had “hit [her] once or twice” already, had repeat-&#xD;
edly threatened her “You’ll never leave me. I’ll kill you&#xD;
if you leave me,” and she was “planning on breaking up”&#xD;
with him. Record, Doc. 51 (Exh. C), pp. 5–6 (hereinafter&#xD;
Kelly Interview). As Kelly described the confrontation, it&#xD;
was only after she fled to her car in order to leave that&#xD;
Bowen reemerged from their shared apartment with the&#xD;
shotgun and told her “I’m gonna kill your ass right here if&#xD;
you take off,” consistent with his prior threats. Id., at 7–8.&#xD;
Every piece of information, therefore, accorded with Detec-&#xD;
tive Messerschmidt’s conclusion: The crime was domestic&#xD;
violence that was not gang related.5&#xD;

   4 The Court is wrong to imply that courts should not consider “facts&#xD;
&#xD;
outside the affidavit,” but within the officers’ possession, when as-&#xD;
sessing qualified immunity. Ante, at 10, n. 2. Our precedents make&#xD;
clear that the objective reasonableness of an officer’s conduct is judged&#xD;
“in light of clearly established law and the information the officers&#xD;
possessed.” Wilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 615 (1999). If an officer&#xD;
possesses information indicating that he lacks probable cause to search,&#xD;
and that information was not presented to the neutral magistrate when&#xD;
he approved the search, it is particularly likely that “a reasonably well&#xD;
trained officer would have known that the search was illegal despite&#xD;
the magistrate’s authorization.” United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897,&#xD;
922, n. 23 (1984).&#xD;
   5 To support its theory that Bowen attacked Kelly to keep her silent&#xD;
&#xD;
about his gang activity, the majority relies principally on its claim that&#xD;
Bowen yelled, “ ‘I told you never to call the cops on me bitch!’ ” ante, at&#xD;
2, citing it no less than five times. See, ante, at 11 (Bowen “attempt[ed]&#xD;

   Unlike the Members of this Court, Detective Messer-&#xD;
schmidt alone had 14 years of experience as a peace of-&#xD;
ficer, “hundreds of hours of instruction on the dynamics of&#xD;
gangs and gang trends,” received “specialized training in&#xD;
the field of gang related crimes,” and had been “involved&#xD;
in hundreds of gang related incidents, contacts, and or&#xD;
arrests.” App. 53–54. The Court provides no justification&#xD;
for sweeping aside the conclusions he reached on the basis&#xD;
of his far greater expertise, let alone the facts found by the&#xD;
District Court. We have repeatedly and recently warned&#xD;
appellate courts, “far removed from the scene,” against&#xD;
second-guessing the judgments made by the police or&#xD;
reweighing the facts as they stood before the district court.&#xD;
Ryburn v. Huff, 565 U. S. —, — (2012) (per curiam) (slip&#xD;
op., at 6–8). The majority’s decision today is totally incon-&#xD;
sistent with those principles.&#xD;
   Qualified immunity analysis does not direct courts to&#xD;
play the role of crime scene investigators, second-guessing&#xD;
police officers’ determinations as to whether a crime was&#xD;
committed with a handgun or a shotgun, or whether vio-&#xD;

statement. Though it appears in the warrant application, the words&#xD;
are Messerschmidt’s—taken from his own inaccurate notes of Kelly’s&#xD;
account of the crime. What Kelly actually said during her interview&#xD;
was that as soon as the police deputies left, Bowen “came out of no-&#xD;
where talking about, ‘Did you call the police on me? You called the&#xD;
police on me,’ ” to which Kelly responded “no one called the police on&#xD;
you . . . . [I]nstead of arguing and fighting with you I just want to get&#xD;
my shit done.” Kelly Interview 7; compare ibid. with Record, Doc. 51&#xD;
(Exh. B), p. 3 (Messerschmidt’s narrative of interview with Kelly). Only&#xD;
after Kelly started to leave did Bowen exclaim “oh it’s like that. It’s&#xD;
like that,” retrieve a gun, and threaten to shoot her if she left. Kelly&#xD;
Interview 7–8. That Bowen was “ ‘angry,’ ” ante, at 14, n. 5, because she&#xD;
had called the sheriff's department for assistance reflected exactly what&#xD;
Kelly and the police expected at the outset—that Bowen “would give&#xD;
her a hard time about moving out.” App. 38 (sheriff’s department&#xD;
incident report).&#xD;

lence was gang related or a domestic dispute. Indeed,&#xD;
we have warned courts against asking “whether another&#xD;
reasonable, or more reasonable, interpretation of the&#xD;
events can be constructed five years after the fact.”&#xD;
Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U. S. 224, 228 (1991) (per curiam).&#xD;
The inquiry our precedents demand is not whether differ-&#xD;
ent conclusions might conceivably be drawn from the&#xD;
crime scene. Rather, it is whether “a reasonably well-&#xD;
trained officer in petitioner’s position would have known&#xD;
that his affidavit failed to establish probable cause.”&#xD;
Malley, 475 U. S., at 345. The operative question in this&#xD;
case, therefore, is whether—given that, as petitioners&#xD;
comprehended, the crime itself was not gang related—a&#xD;
reasonable officer nonetheless could have believed he had&#xD;
probable cause to seek a warrant to search the suspect’s&#xD;
residence for all evidence of affiliation not only with the&#xD;
suspect’s street gang, but “any Street Gang.” He could&#xD;
not.&#xD;
  The Court offers two secondary explanations for why a&#xD;
search for gang-related items might have been justified,&#xD;
but they are equally unpersuasive. First, the majority&#xD;
suggests that such evidence hypothetically “might prove&#xD;
helpful in impeaching Bowen or rebutting various de-&#xD;
fenses he could raise at trial.” Ante, at 15. That is a non-&#xD;
starter. The Fourth Amendment does not permit the police&#xD;
to search for evidence solely because it could be admissible&#xD;
for impeachment or rebuttal purposes. If it did, the police&#xD;
would be equally entitled to obtain warrants to rifle&#xD;
through the papers of anyone reasonably suspected of a&#xD;
crime for all evidence of his bad character, Fed. Rule Evid.&#xD;
404(a)(2)(B)(i), or any evidence of any “crime, wrong, or&#xD;
other act” that might prove the defendant’s “motive, op-&#xD;
portunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity,&#xD;
absence of mistake, or lack of accident,” Fed. Rule Evid.&#xD;
404(b)(2). Indeed, the majority’s rationale presumably&#xD;
would authorize the police to search the residence of every&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
member of Bowen’s street gang for similar weapons—&#xD;
which likewise “might [have] prove[d] helpful in impeach-&#xD;
ing Bowen or rebutting various defenses he could raise at&#xD;
trial.” Ante, at 15. It has long been the case, however,&#xD;
that such general searches, detached from probable cause,&#xD;
are impermissible. See, e.g., Go-Bart Importing Co., 282&#xD;
U. S., at 357. By their own admission, however, the offic-&#xD;
ers were not searching for gang-related indicia to bolster&#xD;
some hypothetical impeachment theory, but for other&#xD;
reasons: because “photos sought re gang membership&#xD;
could be linked with other gang members, evidencing&#xD;
criminal activity as gang affiliation is an enhancement to&#xD;
criminal charges.” App. 181; see also id., at 145. That&#xD;
kind of fishing expedition for evidence of unidentified&#xD;
criminal activity committed by unspecified persons was&#xD;
the very evil the Fourth Amendment was intended to&#xD;
prevent.&#xD;
   Finally, the Court concludes that “even if this were&#xD;
merely a domestic dispute, a reasonable officer could still&#xD;
conclude that gang paraphernalia found at the Millenders’&#xD;
residence would aid in the prosecution of Bowen by, for&#xD;
example, demonstrating Bowen’s connection to other&#xD;
[unspecified] evidence found there.” Ante, at 15. That is&#xD;
difficult to understand. The police were well aware before&#xD;
obtaining a warrant that “other persons associated with&#xD;
the home, the Millender family members, were active&#xD;
Mona Park Crip gang members.” App. 28. Simply finding&#xD;
gang-related paraphernalia, therefore, would have done&#xD;
little to establish probable cause that particular evidence&#xD;
found in the home was connected to Bowen, rather than&#xD;
any of the several other active gang members who resided&#xD;
full time at the Millender home.6 Moreover, it would have&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  6 The Court suggests that even if gang-related evidence would be&#xD;
&#xD;
inconclusive generally, evidence bearing Bowen’s particular gang mon-&#xD;
iker could have demonstrated Bowen’s connection to the residence.&#xD;

done nothing to establish that Bowen had committed the&#xD;
non-gang-related crime specified in the warrant.7&#xD;
                              B&#xD;
   The Court also errs by concluding that petitioners could&#xD;
have reasonably concluded that they had probable cause&#xD;
to search for all firearms. Notably absent from the Court’s&#xD;
discussion is any acknowledgment of the actual basis for&#xD;
petitioners’ search. The police officers searched for all&#xD;
firearms not for the reasons hypothesized by the majority,&#xD;
but because they determined that “[v]alid warrants com-&#xD;
monly allow police to search for ‘firearms and ammuni-&#xD;
tion,’ ” and that “[h]ere, any caliber of shotgun or receipts&#xD;
would show possession of and/or purchase of guns.” Id., at&#xD;
144, 180–181; see also Brief for Appellant in No. 07–55518&#xD;
(CA9), p. 41 (hereinafter CA9 Brief). It is small wonder&#xD;
that the District Court found these arguments “nonsensi-&#xD;
cal and unpersuasive.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 157. It bears&#xD;
repeating that the Founders adopted the Fourth Amend-&#xD;
ment to protect against searches for evidence of unspeci-&#xD;
fied crimes. And merely possessing other firearms is not a&#xD;
crime at all. See generally District of Columbia v. Heller,&#xD;
554 U. S. 570 (2008).8&#xD;
——————&#xD;
But the warrant did not authorize a search for items bearing Bowen’s&#xD;
moniker, but rather for items related to “any Street Gang,” including&#xD;
countless street gangs of which Bowen was not a member. App. 52.&#xD;
Even under the Court’s interpretation, therefore, the warrant was&#xD;
hopelessly overbroad and invalid.&#xD;
  7 The police also could not search for gang-related evidence for its own&#xD;
&#xD;
sake. Mere membership in a gang is not a crime under California law.&#xD;
See People v. Gardeley, 14 Cal. 4th 605, 623, 927 P. 2d 713, 725 (1996).&#xD;
  8 Although the Court recites additional facts about Bowen’s back-&#xD;
&#xD;
ground and arrest record, ante, at 2–3, none of these facts were dis-&#xD;
closed to the magistrate. The police cannot rationalize a search post&#xD;
hoc on the basis of information they failed to set forth in their warrant&#xD;
application to a neutral magistrate. Rather, “[i]t is elementary that in&#xD;
passing on the validity of a warrant, the reviewing court may consider&#xD;
only information brought to the magistrate’s attention.” Aguilar v.&#xD;

&#xD;
   By justifying the officers’ actions on reasons of its own&#xD;
invention, the Court ignores the reasons the officers actu-&#xD;
ally gave, as well as the facts upon which this case was&#xD;
decided below. The majority’s analysis—akin to a rational-&#xD;
basis test—is thus far removed from what qualified&#xD;
immunity analysis demands. Even if the police had&#xD;
searched for the reasons the Court proposes, however, I&#xD;
still would find it inappropriate to afford them qualified&#xD;
immunity.&#xD;
   The Court correctly recognizes that to satisfy the Fourth&#xD;
Amendment the police were required to demonstrate&#xD;
probable cause that (1) other firearms could be found at&#xD;
the Millenders’ residence; and (2) such weapons were&#xD;
illegal or were “ ‘possess[ed] . . . with the intent to use&#xD;
them as a means of committing a public offense.’ ” Ante, at&#xD;
12 (quoting Cal. Penal Code Ann. §1524(a)(3) (West&#xD;
2011)). The warrant failed to establish either.&#xD;
   The majority has little difficulty concluding that because&#xD;
Bowen fired one firearm, it was reasonable for the police&#xD;
to conclude not only that Bowen must have possessed&#xD;
others, but that he must be storing these other weapons&#xD;
at his 73-year-old former foster mother’s home.9 Again,&#xD;
however, this is not what the police actually concluded, as&#xD;
Detective Messerschmidt’s deposition makes clear.&#xD;

qualified immunity for searching pursuant to a warrant by relying&#xD;
upon facts outside that warrant, as evinced by Malley’s focus on&#xD;
“whether a reasonably well-trained officer in petitioner’s position would&#xD;
have known that his affidavit failed to establish probable cause.”&#xD;
Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 345 (1986) (emphasis added).&#xD;
  9 The majority ignores that Bowen retrieved the shotgun that he fired&#xD;
&#xD;
from the apartment he shared with Kelly, not the Millenders’ home.&#xD;
Kelly provided no indication that Bowen possessed other guns or that&#xD;
he stored them at his former foster mother’s home.&#xD;

     “A: I wasn’t given information that there were.” Dep-&#xD;
     osition 120.&#xD;
&#xD;
   Undaunted, the majority finds that a well-trained officer&#xD;
could have concluded on this information that he had&#xD;
probable cause to search for “[a]ll hand guns, . . . [a]ll&#xD;
caliber of ammunition, miscellaneous gun parts, gun&#xD;
cleaning kits, holsters which could hold or have held any&#xD;
caliber handgun being sought,” and “[a]ny receipts or&#xD;
paperwork, showing the purchase, ownership, or posses-&#xD;
sion of the handguns being sought.” App. 52. That is&#xD;
puzzling. If any aspect of the Fourth Amendment is clear-&#xD;
ly established, it is that the police cannot reasonably&#xD;
search—even pursuant to a warrant—for items that they&#xD;
do not have “any reason to believe” will be present. The&#xD;
Court’s conclusion to the contrary simply reads the “prob-&#xD;
able cause” requirement out of the Fourth Amendment.&#xD;
   Even assuming that the police reasonably could have&#xD;
concluded that Bowen possessed other guns and was&#xD;
storing them at the Millenders’ home, I cannot agree that&#xD;
the warrant provided probable cause to believe any weap-&#xD;
on possessed in a home in which 10 persons regularly&#xD;
lived—none of them the suspect in this case—was either&#xD;
“contraband or evidence of a crime.” Ornelas v. United&#xD;
States, 517 U. S. 690, 696 (1996). The warrant set forth no&#xD;
specific facts or particularized explanation establishing&#xD;
probable cause to believe that other guns found in the&#xD;
home were connected to the crime specified in the warrant&#xD;
or were otherwise illegal.10 While the Court hypothesizes&#xD;

&#xD;
that the police could have searched for all firearms to&#xD;
uncover evidence of yet unnamed crimes, ante, at 11–12,&#xD;
the warrant specified that the police were investigating&#xD;
one particular crime—“an assault with a deadly weapon.”&#xD;
App. 55. And the police officers confirmed that their&#xD;
search was targeted to find the gun related to “the crime&#xD;
at issue.” CA9 Brief 42; see also App. 52 (obtaining au-&#xD;
thorization to search for “the item being sought and or&#xD;
believed to be evidence in the case being investigated on&#xD;
this warrant” (emphasis added)).&#xD;
   The police told the Ninth Circuit that they searched for&#xD;
all firearms not because, as the majority hypothesizes,&#xD;
“there would be additional illegal guns among others that&#xD;
Bowen owned,” ante, at 11–12, but on the dubious theory&#xD;
that “Kelly could have been mistaken in her description of&#xD;
the gun.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 20–21. The Ninth Circuit&#xD;
properly dismissed that argument as carrying “little&#xD;
force.” Id., at 21. Its finding is unimpeachable, given that&#xD;
Kelly presented the police with a photograph of Bowen&#xD;
holding the specific gun used in the crime, and the police,&#xD;
the victim, and a witness to the crime all identified the&#xD;
gun as a sawed-off shotgun. See id., at 20, 21, 24, 28.&#xD;
   Finally, the majority suggests that the officers could&#xD;
have reasonably believed that seizure of all firearms at the&#xD;
Millenders’ residence was justified because those weapons&#xD;
might be possessed by Bowen “ ‘with the intent to use&#xD;
them as a means of committing a public offense.’ ” Ante, at&#xD;
12. But the warrant specified that the police sought only&#xD;
the shotgun used in this crime for that purpose. See App.&#xD;
59 (statement of probable cause) (“Your Affiant also be-&#xD;

  The Court also finds error in the Court of Appeals’&#xD;
failure to find “pertinent” the fact that the officer sought&#xD;
approval of his warrant from a magistrate.11 Ante, at 18.&#xD;
Whether Detective Messerschmidt presented his warrant&#xD;
application to a magistrate surely would be “pertinent” to&#xD;
demonstrating his subjective good faith.12 But qualified&#xD;
immunity does not turn on whether an officer is motivated&#xD;
by good intentions or malice, but rather on the “objective&#xD;
reasonableness of an official’s conduct.” Harlow v. Fitz-&#xD;
gerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982).&#xD;
  The majority asserts, without citation, that the magis-&#xD;
trate’s approval is relevant to objective reasonableness.&#xD;
That view, however, is expressly contradicted by our hold-&#xD;
ing in Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335. There, we found&#xD;
that a police officer is not “entitled to rely on the judgment&#xD;
of a judicial officer in finding that probable cause exists&#xD;
and hence issuing the warrant,” and explained that “[that]&#xD;
view of objective reasonableness is at odds with our devel-&#xD;
opment of that concept in Harlow and [United States v.&#xD;
Leon, 468 U. S. 897 (1984)].” Id., at 345. The appropriate&#xD;
qualified immunity analysis, we held, was not whether an&#xD;

issuing search warrants. Cal. Penal Code Ann. §1523 (West 2011).&#xD;
   12 To be clear, no one suggests petitioners acted with malice or in-&#xD;
&#xD;
tended to be “misleading in omitting . . . facts,” ante, at 10, n. 2, that&#xD;
illustrate why it would have been objectively unreasonable to search for&#xD;
the reasons the Court proposes. It is hardly surprising, for instance,&#xD;
that Detective Messerschmidt did not include in his affidavit further&#xD;
facts affirming that the crime was not gang related, given that he did&#xD;
not believe the crime was gang related and did not search for gang-&#xD;
related material for that reason. See supra, at 7–8. The affidavit and&#xD;
warrant were perfectly consistent with the officers’ stated reasons for&#xD;
their search—just not with the Court’s own theories.&#xD;

&#xD;
                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
officer reasonably relied on a magistrate’s probable cause&#xD;
determination, but rather “whether a reasonably well-&#xD;
trained officer in petitioner’s position would have known&#xD;
that his affidavit failed to establish probable cause and&#xD;
that he should not have applied for the warrant.” Ibid.&#xD;
(emphasis added).13 In such a case, “the officer’s applica-&#xD;
tion for a warrant [would] not [be] objectively reasonable,&#xD;
because it create[s] the unnecessary danger of an unlawful&#xD;
arrest.” Ibid. When “no officer of reasonable competence&#xD;
would have requested the warrant,” a “magistrate [who]&#xD;
issues the warrant [makes] not just a reasonable mistake,&#xD;
but an unacceptable error indicating gross incompetence&#xD;
or neglect of duty.” Id., at 346, n. 9. In such cases, “[t]he&#xD;
officer . . . cannot excuse his own default by pointing to the&#xD;
greater incompetence of the magistrate.” Ibid.&#xD;
   In cases in which it would be not only wrong but un-&#xD;
reasonable for any well-trained officer to seek a warrant,&#xD;
allowing a magistrate’s approval to immunize the police&#xD;
officer’s unreasonable action retrospectively makes little&#xD;
sense. By motivating an officer “to reflect, before submit-&#xD;
ting a request for a warrant, upon whether he has a rea-&#xD;
sonable basis for believing that his affidavit establishes&#xD;
probable cause,” we recognized that our qualified immu-&#xD;
nity precedents had the “desirable” effect of “reduc[ing] the&#xD;
likelihood that the officer’s request for a warrant will be&#xD;
premature,” leading to “a waste of judicial resources” or&#xD;
“premature arrests.” Id., at 343. To the extent it proposes&#xD;
to cut back upon Malley, the majority will promote the&#xD;
opposite result—encouraging sloppy police work and ex-&#xD;
acerbating the risk that searches will not comport with&#xD;
the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.&#xD;

&#xD;
   The Court also makes much of the fact that Detective&#xD;
Messerschmidt sent his proposed warrant application to&#xD;
two superior police officers and a district attorney for&#xD;
review. Giving weight to that fact would turn the Fourth&#xD;
Amendment on its head. This Court made clear in Malley&#xD;
that a police officer acting unreasonably cannot obtain&#xD;
qualified immunity on the basis of a neutral magistrate’s&#xD;
approval. It would be passing strange, therefore, to im-&#xD;
munize an officer’s conduct instead based upon the ap-&#xD;
proval of other police officers and prosecutors.14 See John-&#xD;
son v. United States, 333 U. S. 10, 14 (1948) (opinion of&#xD;
Jackson, J.) (“When the right of privacy must reasonably&#xD;
yield to the right of search is, as a rule, to be decided by a&#xD;
judicial officer, not by a policeman or government en-&#xD;
forcement agent”). The effect of the Court’s rule, however,&#xD;
is to hold blameless the “plainly incompetent” action of the&#xD;
police officer seeking a warrant because of the “plainly&#xD;
incompetent” approval of his superiors and the district&#xD;
attorney. See ante, at 16–18; see also ante, at 3–4 (opinion&#xD;
of KAGAN, J.). Under the majority’s test, four wrongs&#xD;
apparently make a right. I cannot agree, however, that&#xD;
the “objective legal reasonableness of an official’s acts,”&#xD;
Harlow, 457 U. S., at 819, turns on the number of police&#xD;
officers or prosecutors who improperly sanction a search&#xD;
that violates the Fourth Amendment.&#xD;

  Police officers perform a difficult and essential service to&#xD;
society, frequently at substantial risk to their personal&#xD;

  14 In the famous case of Wilkes v. Wood, Lofft 1, 98 Eng. Rep. 489&#xD;
&#xD;
(C. P. 1763), one of the seminal events informing the Framers’ development&#xD;
of the Fourth Amendment, the Undersecretary of State who searched&#xD;
the home of John Wilkes pursuant to a general warrant was subjected&#xD;
to monetary damages notwithstanding that his superior, Lord Halifax,&#xD;
issued the warrant. See Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 626&#xD;
(1886).&#xD;

&#xD;
safety. And criminals like Bowen are not sympathetic&#xD;
figures. But the Fourth Amendment “protects all, those&#xD;
suspected or known to be offenders as well as the inno-&#xD;
cent.” Go-Bart Importing Co., 282 U. S., at 357. And this&#xD;
Court long ago recognized that efforts “to bring the guilty&#xD;
to punishment, praiseworthy as they are, are not to be&#xD;
aided by the sacrifice of those great principles established&#xD;
by years of endeavor and suffering which have resulted&#xD;
in their embodiment in the fundamental law of the land.”&#xD;
Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383, 393 (1914).&#xD;
   Qualified immunity properly affords police officers protec-&#xD;
tion so long as their conduct is objectively reasonable.&#xD;
But it is not objectively reasonable for police investi-&#xD;
gating a specific, non-gang-related assault committed with&#xD;
a particular firearm to search for all evidence related to&#xD;
“any Street Gang,” “photographs . . . which may depict&#xD;
evidence of criminal activity,” and all firearms. The Court&#xD;
reaches a contrary result not because it thinks that these&#xD;
police officers’ stated reasons for searching were objective-&#xD;
ly reasonable, but because it thinks different conclusions&#xD;
might be drawn from the crime scene that reasonably&#xD;
might have led different officers to search for different&#xD;
reasons. That analysis, however, is far removed from&#xD;
qualified immunity’s proper focus on whether petitioners&#xD;
acted in an objectively reasonable manner.&#xD;
   Because petitioners did not, I would affirm the judgment&#xD;
of the Court of Appeals.&#xD;
