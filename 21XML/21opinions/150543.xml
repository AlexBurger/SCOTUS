       CERTIORARI TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL OF&#xD;
&#xD;
                   FLORIDA, 1ST DISTRICT&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
   No. 08–7412. Argued November 9, 2009—Decided May 17, 2010; &#xD;
&#xD;
                      modified July 6, 2010 &#xD;
&#xD;
Petitioner Graham was 16 when he committed armed burglary and&#xD;
  another crime. Under a plea agreement, the Florida trial court sen&#xD;
  tenced Graham to probation and withheld adjudication of guilt. Sub&#xD;
  sequently, the trial court found that Graham had violated the terms&#xD;
  of his probation by committing additional crimes. The trial court ad&#xD;
  judicated Graham guilty of the earlier charges, revoked his proba&#xD;
  tion, and sentenced him to life in prison for the burglary. Because&#xD;
  Florida has abolished its parole system, the life sentence left Graham&#xD;
  no possibility of release except executive clemency. He challenged his&#xD;
  sentence under the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Pun&#xD;
  ishments Clause, but the State First District Court of Appeal af&#xD;
  firmed.&#xD;
Held: The Clause does not permit a juvenile offender to be sentenced to&#xD;
 life in prison without parole for a nonhomicide crime. Pp. 7–31.&#xD;
    (a) Embodied in the cruel and unusual punishments ban is the&#xD;
 “precept . . . that punishment for crime should be graduated and pro&#xD;
 portioned to [the] offense.” Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349,&#xD;
 367. The Court’s cases implementing the proportionality standard&#xD;
 fall within two general classifications. In cases of the first type, the&#xD;
 Court has considered all the circumstances to determine whether the&#xD;
 length of a term-of-years sentence is unconstitutionally excessive for&#xD;
 a particular defendant’s crime. The second classification comprises&#xD;
 cases in which the Court has applied certain categorical rules against&#xD;
 the death penalty. In a subset of such cases considering the nature of&#xD;
 the offense, the Court has concluded that capital punishment is im&#xD;
 permissible for nonhomicide crimes against individuals. E.g., Ken&#xD;
 nedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___, ___. In a second subset, cases turn&#xD;
 ing on the offender’s characteristics, the Court has prohibited death&#xD;
2                          GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&#xD;
&#xD;
                                  Syllabus&#xD;
&#xD;
    for defendants who committed their crimes before age 18, Roper v.&#xD;
    Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, or whose intellectual functioning is in a low&#xD;
    range, Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304. In cases involving categori&#xD;
    cal rules, the Court first considers “objective indicia of society’s stan&#xD;
    dards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice” to&#xD;
    determine whether there is a national consensus against the sentenc&#xD;
    ing practice at issue. Roper, supra, at 563. Next, looking to “the&#xD;
    standards elaborated by controlling precedents and by the Court’s&#xD;
    own understanding and interpretation of the Eighth Amendment’s&#xD;
    text, history, meaning, and purpose,” Kennedy, supra, at ___, the&#xD;
    Court determines in the exercise of its own independent judgment&#xD;
    whether the punishment in question violates the Constitution, Roper,&#xD;
    supra, at 564. Because this case implicates a particular type of sen&#xD;
    tence as it applies to an entire class of offenders who have committed&#xD;
    a range of crimes, the appropriate analysis is the categorical ap&#xD;
    proach used in Atkins, Roper, and Kennedy. Pp. 7–10.&#xD;
       (b) Application of the foregoing approach convinces the Court that&#xD;
    the sentencing practice at issue is unconstitutional. Pp. 10–31.&#xD;
         (1) Six jurisdictions do not allow life without parole sentences for&#xD;
    any juvenile offenders. Seven jurisdictions permit life without parole&#xD;
    for juvenile offenders, but only for homicide crimes. Thirty-seven&#xD;
    States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government permit&#xD;
    sentences of life without parole for a juvenile nonhomicide offender in&#xD;
    some circumstances. The State relies on these data to argue that no&#xD;
    national consensus against the sentencing practice in question exists.&#xD;
    An examination of actual sentencing practices in those jurisdictions&#xD;
    that permit life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders,&#xD;
    however, discloses a consensus against the sentence. Nationwide,&#xD;
    there are only 123 juvenile offenders serving life without parole sen&#xD;
    tences for nonhomicide crimes. Because 77 of those offenders are&#xD;
    serving sentences imposed in Florida and the other 46 are imprisoned&#xD;
    in just 10 States, it appears that only 11 jurisdictions nationwide in&#xD;
    fact impose life without parole sentences on juvenile nonhomicide of&#xD;
    fenders, while 26 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal&#xD;
    Government do not impose them despite apparent statutory authori&#xD;
    zation. Given that the statistics reflect nearly all juvenile nonhomi&#xD;
    cide offenders who have received a life without parole sentence&#xD;
    stretching back many years, moreover, it is clear how rare these sen&#xD;
    tences are, even within the States that do sometimes impose them.&#xD;
    While more common in terms of absolute numbers than the sentenc&#xD;
    ing practices in, e.g., Atkins and Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, the&#xD;
    type of sentence at issue is actually as rare as those other sentencing&#xD;
    practices when viewed in proportion to the opportunities for its imposi&#xD;
    tion. The fact that many jurisdictions do not expressly prohibit the&#xD;
                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3&#xD;
&#xD;
                              Syllabus&#xD;
&#xD;
sentencing practice at issue is not dispositive because it does not nec&#xD;
essarily follow that the legislatures in those jurisdictions have delib&#xD;
erately concluded that such sentences would be appropriate. See&#xD;
Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815, 826, n. 24, 850. Pp. 10–16.&#xD;
     (2) The inadequacy of penological theory to justify life without&#xD;
parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, the limited cul&#xD;
pability of such offenders, and the severity of these sentences all lead&#xD;
the Court to conclude that the sentencing practice at issue is cruel&#xD;
and unusual. No recent data provide reason to reconsider Roper’s&#xD;
holding that because juveniles have lessened culpability they are less&#xD;
deserving of the most serious forms of punishment. 543 U. S., at 551.&#xD;
Moreover, defendants who do not kill, intend to kill, or foresee that&#xD;
life will be taken are categorically less deserving of such punishments&#xD;
than are murderers. E.g., Kennedy, supra. Serious nonhomicide&#xD;
crimes “may be devastating in their harm . . . but ‘in terms of moral&#xD;
depravity and of the injury to the person and to the public,’ . . . they&#xD;
cannot be compared to murder in their ‘severity and irrevocability.’ ”&#xD;
Id., at ___. Thus, when compared to an adult murderer, a juvenile of&#xD;
fender who did not kill or intend to kill has a twice diminished moral&#xD;
culpability. Age and the nature of the crime each bear on the analy&#xD;
sis. As for the punishment, life without parole is “the second most&#xD;
severe penalty permitted by law,” Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S.&#xD;
957, 1001, and is especially harsh for a juvenile offender, who will on&#xD;
average serve more years and a greater percentage of his life in&#xD;
prison than an adult offender, see, e.g., Roper, supra, at 572. And&#xD;
none of the legitimate goals of penal sanctions—retribution, deter&#xD;
rence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, see Ewing v. California, 538&#xD;
U. S. 11, 25—is adequate to justify life without parole for juvenile&#xD;
nonhomicide offenders, see, e.g., Roper, 543 U. S., at 571, 573. Be&#xD;
cause age “18 is the point where society draws the line for many pur&#xD;
poses between childhood and adulthood,” it is the age below which a&#xD;
defendant may not be sentenced to life without parole for a nonhomi&#xD;
cide crime. Id., at 574. A State is not required to guarantee eventual&#xD;
freedom to such an offender, but must impose a sentence that pro&#xD;
vides some meaningful opportunity for release based on demon&#xD;
strated maturity and rehabilitation. It is for the State, in the first&#xD;
instance, to explore the means and mechanisms for compliance.&#xD;
Pp. 16–24.&#xD;
     (3) A categorical rule is necessary, given the inadequacy of two&#xD;
alternative approaches to address the relevant constitutional con&#xD;
cerns. First, although Florida and other States have made substan&#xD;
tial efforts to enact comprehensive rules governing the treatment of&#xD;
youthful offenders, such laws allow the imposition of the type of sen&#xD;
tence at issue based only on a discretionary, subjective judgment by a&#xD;
4                         GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&#xD;
&#xD;
                                  Syllabus&#xD;
&#xD;
    judge or jury that the juvenile offender is irredeemably depraved, and&#xD;
    are therefore insufficient to prevent the possibility that the offender&#xD;
    will receive such a sentence despite a lack of moral culpability. Sec&#xD;
    ond, a case-by-case approach requiring that the particular offender’s&#xD;
    age be weighed against the seriousness of the crime as part of a gross&#xD;
    disproportionality inquiry would not allow courts to distinguish with&#xD;
    sufficient accuracy the few juvenile offenders having sufficient psy&#xD;
    chological maturity and depravity to merit a life without parole sen&#xD;
    tence from the many that have the capacity for change. Cf. Roper,&#xD;
    supra, at 572–573. Nor does such an approach take account of spe&#xD;
    cial difficulties encountered by counsel in juvenile representation,&#xD;
    given juveniles’ impulsiveness, difficulty thinking in terms of long&#xD;
    term benefits, and reluctance to trust adults. A categorical rule&#xD;
    avoids the risk that, as a result of these difficulties, a court or jury&#xD;
    will erroneously conclude that a particular juvenile is sufficiently&#xD;
    culpable to deserve life without parole for a nonhomicide. It also&#xD;
    gives the juvenile offender a chance to demonstrate maturity and re&#xD;
    form. Pp. 24–29.&#xD;
          (4) Additional support for the Court’s conclusion lies in the fact&#xD;
    that the sentencing practice at issue has been rejected the world over:&#xD;
    The United States is the only Nation that imposes this type of sen&#xD;
    tence. While the judgments of other nations and the international&#xD;
    community are not dispositive as to the meaning of the Eighth&#xD;
    Amendment, the Court has looked abroad to support its independent&#xD;
    conclusion that a particular punishment is cruel and unusual. See,&#xD;
    e.g., Roper, supra, at 575–578. Pp. 29–31.&#xD;

    TERRANCE JAMAR GRAHAM, PETITIONER v.&#xD;
&#xD;
                 FLORIDA &#xD;
&#xD;
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL&#xD;
              OF FLORIDA, FIRST DISTRICT&#xD;
                   [May 17, 2010; modified July 6, 2010]&#xD;
&#xD;
  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.&#xD;
  The issue before the Court is whether the Constitution&#xD;
permits a juvenile offender to be sentenced to life in prison&#xD;
without parole for a nonhomicide crime. The sentence was&#xD;
imposed by the State of Florida. Petitioner challenges the&#xD;
sentence under the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Un&#xD;
usual Punishments Clause, made applicable to the States&#xD;
by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.&#xD;
Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660 (1962).&#xD;
                            I&#xD;
  Petitioner is Terrance Jamar Graham. He was born on&#xD;
January 6, 1987. Graham’s parents were addicted to&#xD;
crack cocaine, and their drug use persisted in his early&#xD;
years. Graham was diagnosed with attention deficit hy&#xD;
peractivity disorder in elementary school. He began&#xD;
drinking alcohol and using tobacco at age 9 and smoked&#xD;
marijuana at age 13.&#xD;
  In July 2003, when Graham was age 16, he and three&#xD;
other school-age youths attempted to rob a barbeque&#xD;
restaurant in Jacksonville, Florida. One youth, who&#xD;
worked at the restaurant, left the back door unlocked just&#xD;
2                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&#xD;
&#xD;
                Appendix to opinion of the Court&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
before closing time. Graham and another youth, wearing&#xD;
masks, entered through the unlocked door. Graham’s&#xD;
masked accomplice twice struck the restaurant manager&#xD;
in the back of the head with a metal bar. When the man&#xD;
ager started yelling at the assailant and Graham, the two&#xD;
youths ran out and escaped in a car driven by the third&#xD;
accomplice. The restaurant manager required stitches for&#xD;
his head injury. No money was taken.&#xD;
   Graham was arrested for the robbery attempt. Under&#xD;
Florida law, it is within a prosecutor’s discretion whether&#xD;
to charge 16- and 17-year-olds as adults or juveniles for&#xD;
most felony crimes. Fla. Stat. §985.227(1)(b) (2003) (sub&#xD;
sequently renumbered at §985.557(1)(b) (2007)). Gra&#xD;
ham’s prosecutor elected to charge Graham as an adult.&#xD;
The charges against Graham were armed burglary with&#xD;
assault or battery, a first-degree felony carrying a maxi&#xD;
mum penalty of life imprisonment without the possibility&#xD;
of parole, §§810.02(1)(b), (2)(a) (2003); and attempted&#xD;
armed-robbery, a second-degree felony carrying a maxi&#xD;
mum penalty of 15 years’ imprisonment, §§812.13(2)(b),&#xD;
777.04(1), (4)(a), 775.082(3)(c).&#xD;
   On December 18, 2003, Graham pleaded guilty to both&#xD;
charges under a plea agreement. Graham wrote a letter to&#xD;
the trial court. After reciting “this is my first and last&#xD;
time getting in trouble,” he continued “I’ve decided to turn&#xD;
my life around.” App. 379–380. Graham said “I made a&#xD;
promise to God and myself that if I get a second chance,&#xD;
I’m going to do whatever it takes to get to the [National&#xD;
Football League].” Id., at 380.&#xD;
   The trial court accepted the plea agreement. The court&#xD;
withheld adjudication of guilt as to both charges and&#xD;
sentenced Graham to concurrent 3-year terms of proba&#xD;
tion. Graham was required to spend the first 12 months of&#xD;
his probation in the county jail, but he received credit for&#xD;
the time he had served awaiting trial, and was released on&#xD;
June 25, 2004.&#xD;

                    Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
   Less than 6 months later, on the night of December 2,&#xD;
2004, Graham again was arrested. The State’s case was&#xD;
as follows: Earlier that evening, Graham participated in a&#xD;
home invasion robbery. His two accomplices were Meigo&#xD;
Bailey and Kirkland Lawrence, both 20-year-old men.&#xD;
According to the State, at 7 p.m. that night, Graham,&#xD;
Bailey, and Lawrence knocked on the door of the home&#xD;
where Carlos Rodriguez lived. Graham, followed by Bailey&#xD;
and Lawrence, forcibly entered the home and held a pistol&#xD;
to Rodriguez’s chest. For the next 30 minutes, the three&#xD;
held Rodriguez and another man, a friend of Rodriguez, at&#xD;
gunpoint while they ransacked the home searching for&#xD;
money. Before leaving, Graham and his accomplices&#xD;
barricaded Rodriguez and his friend inside a closet.&#xD;
   The State further alleged that Graham, Bailey, and&#xD;
Lawrence, later the same evening, attempted a second&#xD;
robbery, during which Bailey was shot. Graham, who had&#xD;
borrowed his father’s car, drove Bailey and Lawrence to&#xD;
the hospital and left them there. As Graham drove away,&#xD;
a police sergeant signaled him to stop. Graham continued&#xD;
at a high speed but crashed into a telephone pole. He&#xD;
tried to flee on foot but was apprehended. Three hand&#xD;
guns were found in his car.&#xD;
   When detectives interviewed Graham, he denied in&#xD;
volvement in the crimes. He said he encountered Bailey&#xD;
and Lawrence only after Bailey had been shot. One of the&#xD;
detectives told Graham that the victims of the home inva&#xD;
sion had identified him. He asked Graham, “Aside from&#xD;
the two robberies tonight how many more were you in&#xD;
volved in?” Graham responded, “Two to three before&#xD;
tonight.” Id., at 160. The night that Graham allegedly&#xD;
committed the robbery, he was 34 days short of his 18th&#xD;
birthday.&#xD;
   On December 13, 2004, Graham’s probation officer filed&#xD;
with the trial court an affidavit asserting that Graham&#xD;
had violated the conditions of his probation by possessing&#xD;

&#xD;

                    Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
a firearm, committing crimes, and associating with per&#xD;
sons engaged in criminal activity. The trial court held&#xD;
hearings on Graham’s violations about a year later, in&#xD;
December 2005 and January 2006. The judge who pre&#xD;
sided was not the same judge who had accepted Graham’s&#xD;
guilty plea to the earlier offenses.&#xD;
   Graham maintained that he had no involvement in the&#xD;
home invasion robbery; but, even after the court under&#xD;
scored that the admission could expose him to a life sen&#xD;
tence on the earlier charges, he admitted violating proba&#xD;
tion conditions by fleeing. The State presented evidence&#xD;
related to the home invasion, including testimony from the&#xD;
victims. The trial court noted that Graham, in admitting&#xD;
his attempt to avoid arrest, had acknowledged violating&#xD;
his probation. The court further found that Graham had&#xD;
violated his probation by committing a home invasion&#xD;
robbery, by possessing a firearm, and by associating with&#xD;
persons engaged in criminal activity.&#xD;
   The trial court held a sentencing hearing. Under Flor&#xD;
ida law the minimum sentence Graham could receive&#xD;
absent a downward departure by the judge was 5 years’&#xD;
imprisonment. The maximum was life imprisonment.&#xD;
Graham’s attorney requested the minimum nondeparture&#xD;
sentence of 5 years. A presentence report prepared by the&#xD;
Florida Department of Corrections recommended that&#xD;
Graham receive an even lower sentence—at most 4 years’&#xD;
imprisonment. The State recommended that Graham&#xD;
receive 30 years on the armed burglary count and 15 years&#xD;
on the attempted armed robbery count.&#xD;
   After hearing Graham’s testimony, the trial court ex&#xD;
plained the sentence it was about to pronounce:&#xD;
      “Mr. Graham, as I look back on your case, yours is&#xD;
    really candidly a sad situation. You had, as far as I&#xD;
    can tell, you have quite a family structure. You had a&#xD;
    lot of people who wanted to try and help you get your&#xD;

&#xD;
life turned around including the court system, and&#xD;
you had a judge who took the step to try and give you&#xD;
direction through his probation order to give you a&#xD;
chance to get back onto track. And at the time you&#xD;
seemed through your letters that that is exactly what&#xD;
you wanted to do. And I don’t know why it is that you&#xD;
threw your life away. I don’t know why.&#xD;
   “But you did, and that is what is so sad about this&#xD;
today is that you have actually been given a chance to&#xD;
get through this, the original charge, which were very&#xD;
serious charges to begin with. . . . The attempted rob&#xD;
bery with a weapon was a very serious charge.&#xD;
  .            .              .                .      .&#xD;
   “[I]n a very short period of time you were back be&#xD;
fore the Court on a violation of this probation, and&#xD;
then here you are two years later standing before me,&#xD;
literally the—facing a life sentence as to—up to life as&#xD;
to count 1 and up to 15 years as to count 2.&#xD;
   “And I don’t understand why you would be given&#xD;
such a great opportunity to do something with your&#xD;
life and why you would throw it away. The only thing&#xD;
that I can rationalize is that you decided that this is&#xD;
how you were going to lead your life and that there is&#xD;
nothing that we can do for you. And as the state&#xD;
pointed out, that this is an escalating pattern of&#xD;
criminal conduct on your part and that we can’t help&#xD;
you any further. We can’t do anything to deter you.&#xD;
This is the way you are going to lead your life, and I&#xD;
don’t know why you are going to. You’ve made that&#xD;
decision. I have no idea. But, evidently, that is what&#xD;
you decided to do.&#xD;

    day is I don’t see where I can do anything to help you&#xD;
    any further. You’ve evidently decided this is the di&#xD;
    rection you’re going to take in life, and it’s unfortu&#xD;
    nate that you made that choice.&#xD;
      “I have reviewed the statute. I don’t see where any&#xD;
    further juvenile sanctions would be appropriate. I&#xD;
    don’t see where any youthful offender sanctions would&#xD;
    be appropriate. Given your escalating pattern of&#xD;
    criminal conduct, it is apparent to the Court that you&#xD;
    have decided that this is the way you are going to live&#xD;
    your life and that the only thing I can do now is to try&#xD;
    and protect the community from your actions.” Id., at&#xD;
    392–394.&#xD;
  The trial court found Graham guilty of the earlier armed&#xD;
burglary and attempted armed robbery charges. It sen&#xD;
tenced him to the maximum sentence authorized by law&#xD;
on each charge: life imprisonment for the armed burglary&#xD;
and 15 years for the attempted armed robbery. Because&#xD;
Florida has abolished its parole system, see Fla. Stat.&#xD;
§921.002(1)(e) (2003), a life sentence gives a defendant&#xD;
no possibility of release unless he is granted executive&#xD;
clemency.&#xD;
  Graham filed a motion in the trial court challenging his&#xD;
sentence under the Eighth Amendment. The motion was&#xD;
deemed denied after the trial court failed to rule on it&#xD;
within 60 days. The First District Court of Appeal of&#xD;
Florida affirmed, concluding that Graham’s sentence was&#xD;
not grossly disproportionate to his crimes. &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/fladistctapp/9ov1/graham-v-state/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;982&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;So. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;43&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&#xD;
(2008). The court took note of the seriousness of Graham’s&#xD;
offenses and their violent nature, as well as the fact that&#xD;
they “were not committed by a pre-teen, but a seventeen&#xD;
year-old who was ultimately sentenced at the age of nine&#xD;
teen.” Id., at 52. The court concluded further that Gra&#xD;
ham was incapable of rehabilitation. Although Graham&#xD;

                              II&#xD;
   The Eighth Amendment states: “Excessive bail shall not&#xD;
be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and&#xD;
unusual punishments inflicted.” To determine whether a&#xD;
punishment is cruel and unusual, courts must look beyond&#xD;
historical conceptions to “ ‘the evolving standards of de&#xD;
cency that mark the progress of a maturing society.’ ”&#xD;
Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 102 (1976) (quoting Trop&#xD;
v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion)).&#xD;
“This is because ‘[t]he standard of extreme cruelty is not&#xD;
merely descriptive, but necessarily embodies a moral&#xD;
judgment. The standard itself remains the same, but its&#xD;
applicability must change as the basic mores of society&#xD;
change.’ ” Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008)&#xD;
(slip op., at 8) (quoting Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238,&#xD;
382 (1972) (Burger, C. J., dissenting)).&#xD;
   The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause prohibits&#xD;
the imposition of inherently barbaric punishments under&#xD;
all circumstances. See, e.g., Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S. 730&#xD;
(2002). “[P]unishments of torture,” for example, “are&#xD;
forbidden.” Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130, 136 (1879).&#xD;
These cases underscore the essential principle that, under&#xD;
the Eighth Amendment, the State must respect the hu&#xD;
man attributes even of those who have committed serious&#xD;
crimes.&#xD;
   For the most part, however, the Court’s precedents&#xD;
8                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&#xD;
&#xD;
                Appendix to opinion of the Court&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
consider punishments challenged not as inherently bar&#xD;
baric but as disproportionate to the crime. The concept of&#xD;
proportionality is central to the Eighth Amendment.&#xD;
Embodied in the Constitution’s ban on cruel and unusual&#xD;
punishments is the “precept of justice that punishment for&#xD;
crime should be graduated and proportioned to [the] of&#xD;
fense.” Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 367 (1910).&#xD;
   The Court’s cases addressing the proportionality of&#xD;
sentences fall within two general classifications. The first&#xD;
involves challenges to the length of term-of-years sen&#xD;
tences given all the circumstances in a particular case.&#xD;
The second comprises cases in which the Court imple&#xD;
ments the proportionality standard by certain categorical&#xD;
restrictions on the death penalty.&#xD;
   In the first classification the Court considers all of the&#xD;
circumstances of the case to determine whether the sen&#xD;
tence is unconstitutionally excessive. Under this ap&#xD;
proach, the Court has held unconstitutional a life without&#xD;
parole sentence for the defendant’s seventh nonviolent&#xD;
felony, the crime of passing a worthless check. Solem v.&#xD;
Helm, 463 U. S. 277 (1983). In other cases, however, it&#xD;
has been difficult for the challenger to establish a lack of&#xD;
proportionality. A leading case is Harmelin v. Michigan,&#xD;
501 U. S. 957 (1991), in which the offender was sentenced&#xD;
under state law to life without parole for possessing a&#xD;
large quantity of cocaine. A closely divided Court upheld&#xD;
the sentence. The controlling opinion concluded that the&#xD;
Eighth Amendment contains a “narrow proportionality&#xD;
principle,” that “does not require strict proportionality&#xD;
between crime and sentence” but rather “forbids only&#xD;
extreme sentences that are ‘grossly disproportionate’ to&#xD;
the crime.” Id., at 997, 1000–1001 (KENNEDY, J., concur&#xD;
ring in part and concurring in judgment). Again closely&#xD;
divided, the Court rejected a challenge to a sentence of 25&#xD;
years to life for the theft of a few golf clubs under Califor&#xD;
nia’s so-called three-strikes recidivist sentencing scheme.&#xD;

&#xD;
Ewing v. California, 538 U. S. 11 (2003); see also Lockyer&#xD;
v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63 (2003). The Court has also up&#xD;
held a sentence of life with the possibility of parole for a&#xD;
defendant’s third nonviolent felony, the crime of obtaining&#xD;
money by false pretenses, Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263&#xD;
(1980), and a sentence of 40 years for possession of mari&#xD;
juana with intent to distribute and distribution of mari&#xD;
juana, Hutto v. Davis, 454 U. S. 370 (1982) (per curiam).&#xD;
  The controlling opinion in Harmelin explained its ap&#xD;
proach for determining whether a sentence for a term of&#xD;
years is grossly disproportionate for a particular defen&#xD;
dant’s crime. A court must begin by comparing the gravity&#xD;
of the offense and the severity of the sentence. 501 U. S.,&#xD;
at 1005 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). “[I]n the rare case in&#xD;
which [this] threshold comparison . . . leads to an infer&#xD;
ence of gross disproportionality” the court should then&#xD;
compare the defendant’s sentence with the sentences&#xD;
received by other offenders in the same jurisdiction and&#xD;
with the sentences imposed for the same crime in other&#xD;
jurisdictions. Ibid. If this comparative analysis “vali&#xD;
date[s] an initial judgment that [the] sentence is grossly&#xD;
disproportionate,” the sentence is cruel and unusual. Ibid.&#xD;
   The second classification of cases has used categorical&#xD;
rules to define Eighth Amendment standards. The previ&#xD;
ous cases in this classification involved the death penalty.&#xD;
The classification in turn consists of two subsets, one&#xD;
considering the nature of the offense, the other consider&#xD;
ing the characteristics of the offender. With respect to the&#xD;
nature of the offense, the Court has concluded that capital&#xD;
punishment is impermissible for nonhomicide crimes&#xD;
against individuals. Kennedy, supra, at __ (slip op., at 28);&#xD;
see also Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782 (1982); Coker v.&#xD;
Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977). In cases turning on the&#xD;
characteristics of the offender, the Court has adopted&#xD;
categorical rules prohibiting the death penalty for defen&#xD;
dants who committed their crimes before the age of 18,&#xD;

&#xD;
                Appendix to opinion of the Court&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005), or whose intellec&#xD;
tual functioning is in a low range, Atkins v. Virginia, 536&#xD;
U. S. 304 (2002). See also Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487&#xD;
U. S. 815 (1988).&#xD;
   In the cases adopting categorical rules the Court has&#xD;
taken the following approach. The Court first considers&#xD;
“objective indicia of society’s standards, as expressed in&#xD;
legislative enactments and state practice” to determine&#xD;
whether there is a national consensus against the sentenc&#xD;
ing practice at issue. Roper, supra, at 563. Next, guided&#xD;
by “the standards elaborated by controlling precedents&#xD;
and by the Court’s own understanding and interpretation&#xD;
of the Eighth Amendment’s text, history, meaning, and&#xD;
purpose,” Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10), the&#xD;
Court must determine in the exercise of its own inde&#xD;
pendent judgment whether the punishment in question&#xD;
violates the Constitution. Roper, supra, at 564.&#xD;
   The present case involves an issue the Court has not&#xD;
considered previously: a categorical challenge to a term-of&#xD;
years sentence. The approach in cases such as Harmelin&#xD;
and Ewing is suited for considering a gross proportionality&#xD;
challenge to a particular defendant’s sentence, but here a&#xD;
sentencing practice itself is in question. This case impli&#xD;
cates a particular type of sentence as it applies to an&#xD;
entire class of offenders who have committed a range of&#xD;
crimes. As a result, a threshold comparison between the&#xD;
severity of the penalty and the gravity of the crime does&#xD;
not advance the analysis. Here, in addressing the ques&#xD;
tion presented, the appropriate analysis is the one used in&#xD;
cases that involved the categorical approach, specifically&#xD;
Atkins, Roper, and Kennedy.&#xD;

evidence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted&#xD;
by the country’s legislatures.’ ” Atkins, supra, at 312&#xD;
(quoting Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 331 (1989)). Six&#xD;
jurisdictions do not allow life without parole sentences for&#xD;
any juvenile offenders. See Appendix, infra, Part III.&#xD;
Seven jurisdictions permit life without parole for juvenile&#xD;
offenders, but only for homicide crimes. Id., Part II.&#xD;
Thirty-seven States as well as the District of Columbia&#xD;
permit sentences of life without parole for a juvenile non&#xD;
homicide offender in some circumstances. Id., Part I.&#xD;
Federal law also allows for the possibility of life without&#xD;
parole for offenders as young as 13. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C.&#xD;
§§2241 (2006 ed. and Supp. II), 5032 (2006 ed.). Relying&#xD;
on this metric, the State and its amici argue that there is&#xD;
no national consensus against the sentencing practice at&#xD;
issue.&#xD;
  This argument is incomplete and unavailing. “There are&#xD;
measures of consensus other than legislation.” Kennedy,&#xD;
supra, at ___ (slip op., at 22). Actual sentencing practices&#xD;
are an important part of the Court’s inquiry into consen&#xD;
sus. See Enmund, supra, at 794–796; Thompson, supra,&#xD;
at 831–832 (plurality opinion); Atkins, supra, at 316;&#xD;
Roper, supra, at 564–565; Kennedy, supra, at ___ (slip op.,&#xD;
at 22–23). Here, an examination of actual sentencing&#xD;
practices in jurisdictions where the sentence in question is&#xD;
permitted by statute discloses a consensus against its use.&#xD;
Although these statutory schemes contain no explicit&#xD;
prohibition on sentences of life without parole for juvenile&#xD;
nonhomicide offenders, those sentences are most infre&#xD;
quent. According to a recent study, nationwide there are&#xD;
only 109 juvenile offenders serving sentences of life with&#xD;
out parole for nonhomicide offenses. See P. Annino, D.&#xD;
Rasmussen, &amp; C. Rice, Juvenile Life without Parole for&#xD;
Non-Homicide Offenses: Florida Compared to Nation 2&#xD;
(Sept. 14, 2009) (hereinafter Annino).&#xD;
  The State contends that this study’s tally is inaccurate&#xD;

                Appendix to opinion of the Court&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;

because it does not count juvenile offenders who were&#xD;
convicted of both a homicide and a nonhomicide offense,&#xD;
even when the offender received a life without parole&#xD;
sentence for the nonhomicide. See Brief for Respondent&#xD;
34; Tr. of Oral Arg. in Sullivan v. Florida, O. T. 2009,&#xD;
No. 08–7621, pp. 28–31. This distinction is unpersuasive.&#xD;
Juvenile offenders who committed both homicide and&#xD;
nonhomicide crimes present a different situation for a&#xD;
sentencing judge than juvenile offenders who committed&#xD;
no homicide. It is difficult to say that a defendant who&#xD;
receives a life sentence on a nonhomicide offense but who&#xD;
was at the same time convicted of homicide is not in some&#xD;
sense being punished in part for the homicide when the&#xD;
judge makes the sentencing determination. The instant&#xD;
case concerns only those juvenile offenders sentenced&#xD;
to life without parole solely for a nonhomicide offense.&#xD;
   Florida further criticizes this study because the authors&#xD;
were unable to obtain complete information on some&#xD;
States and because the study was not peer reviewed. See&#xD;
Brief for Respondent 40. The State does not, however,&#xD;
provide any data of its own. Although in the first instance&#xD;
it is for the litigants to provide data to aid the Court, we&#xD;
have been able to supplement the study’s findings. The&#xD;
study’s authors were not able to obtain a definitive tally&#xD;
for Nevada, Utah, or Virginia. See Annino 11–13. Our&#xD;
research shows that Nevada has five juvenile nonhomicide&#xD;
offenders serving life without parole sentences, Utah has&#xD;
none, and Virginia has eight. See Letter from Alejandra&#xD;

  Thus, adding the individuals counted by the study to&#xD;
those we have been able to locate independently, there are&#xD;
123 juvenile nonhomicide offenders serving life without&#xD;
parole sentences. A significant majority of those, 77 in&#xD;
total, are serving sentences imposed in Florida. Annino 2.&#xD;
The other 46 are imprisoned in just 10 States—California,&#xD;

none of the six prisoners referred to in the earlier BOP report is serving&#xD;
a life without parole sentence solely for a juvenile nonhomicide crime&#xD;
completed before the age of 18. Letter from Neal Kumar Katyal, Acting&#xD;

the Government was not aware of any other federal prisoners serving&#xD;
life without parole sentences solely for juvenile nonhomicide crimes.&#xD;

jurisdiction’s penal system, regardless of when they were&#xD;
convicted. It becomes all the more clear how rare these&#xD;
sentences are, even within the jurisdictions that do some&#xD;
times impose them, when one considers that a juvenile&#xD;
sentenced to life without parole is likely to live in prison&#xD;
for decades. Thus, these statistics likely reflect nearly all&#xD;
juvenile nonhomicide offenders who have received a life&#xD;
without parole sentence stretching back many years. It is&#xD;
not certain that this opinion has identified every juvenile&#xD;
nonhomicide offender nationwide serving a life without&#xD;
parole sentence, for the statistics are not precise. The&#xD;
available data, nonetheless, are sufficient to demonstrate&#xD;
how rarely these sentences are imposed even if there are&#xD;
isolated cases that have not been included in the presenta&#xD;
tions of the parties or the analysis of the Court.&#xD;
   It must be acknowledged that in terms of absolute num&#xD;
bers juvenile life without parole sentences for nonhomi&#xD;
cides are more common than the sentencing practices at&#xD;
issue in some of this Court’s other Eighth Amendment&#xD;
cases. See, e.g., Enmund, 458 U. S., at 794 (only six exe&#xD;
cutions of nontriggerman felony murderers between 1954&#xD;
and 1982) Atkins, 536 U. S., at 316 (only five executions of&#xD;
mentally retarded defendants in 13-year period). This&#xD;
contrast can be instructive, however, if attention is first&#xD;
given to the base number of certain types of offenses. For&#xD;
example, in the year 2007 (the most recent year for which&#xD;
statistics are available), a total of 13,480 persons, adult&#xD;
and juvenile, were arrested for homicide crimes. That&#xD;
same year, 57,600 juveniles were arrested for aggravated&#xD;
assault; 3,580 for forcible rape; 34,500 for robbery; 81,900&#xD;
for burglary; 195,700 for drug offenses; and 7,200 for&#xD;
arson. See Dept. of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and&#xD;
Delinquency Prevention, Statistical Briefing Book, online&#xD;
at http://ojjdp.ncjrs.org/ojstatbb/ (as visited May 14, 2010,&#xD;
and available in Clerk of Court’s case file). Although it is&#xD;
not certain how many of these numerous juvenile offend&#xD;

                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
ers were eligible for life without parole sentences, the&#xD;
comparison suggests that in proportion to the opportuni&#xD;
ties for its imposition, life without parole sentences for&#xD;
juveniles convicted of nonhomicide crimes is as rare as&#xD;
other sentencing practices found to be cruel and unusual.&#xD;
   The evidence of consensus is not undermined by the fact&#xD;
that many jurisdictions do not prohibit life without parole&#xD;
for juvenile nonhomicide offenders. The Court confronted&#xD;
a similar situation in Thompson, where a plurality con&#xD;
cluded that the death penalty for offenders younger than&#xD;
16 was unconstitutional. A number of States then allowed&#xD;
the juvenile death penalty if one considered the statutory&#xD;
scheme. As is the case here, those States authorized the&#xD;
transfer of some juvenile offenders to adult court; and at&#xD;
that point there was no statutory differentiation between&#xD;
adults and juveniles with respect to authorized penalties.&#xD;
The plurality concluded that the transfer laws show “that&#xD;
the States consider 15-year-olds to be old enough to be&#xD;
tried in criminal court for serious crimes (or too old to be&#xD;
dealt with effectively in juvenile court), but tells us noth&#xD;
ing about the judgment these States have made regarding&#xD;
the appropriate punishment for such youthful offenders.”&#xD;
487 U. S., at 826, n. 24. Justice O’Connor, concurring in&#xD;
the judgment, took a similar view. Id., at 850 (“When a&#xD;
legislature provides for some 15-year-olds to be processed&#xD;
through the adult criminal justice system, and capital&#xD;
punishment is available for adults in that jurisdiction, the&#xD;
death penalty becomes at least theoretically applicable to&#xD;
such defendants. . . . [H]owever, it does not necessarily&#xD;
follow that the legislatures in those jurisdictions have&#xD;
deliberately concluded that it would be appropriate”).&#xD;
   The same reasoning obtains here. Many States have&#xD;
chosen to move away from juvenile court systems and to&#xD;
allow juveniles to be transferred to, or charged directly in,&#xD;
adult court under certain circumstances. Once in adult&#xD;
court, a juvenile offender may receive the same sentence&#xD;

as would be given to an adult offender, including a life&#xD;
without parole sentence. But the fact that transfer and&#xD;
direct charging laws make life without parole possible for&#xD;
some juvenile nonhomicide offenders does not justify a&#xD;
judgment that many States intended to subject such of&#xD;
fenders to life without parole sentences.&#xD;
   For example, under Florida law a child of any age can be&#xD;
prosecuted as an adult for certain crimes and can be sen&#xD;
tenced to life without parole. The State acknowledged at&#xD;
oral argument that even a 5-year-old, theoretically, could&#xD;
receive such a sentence under the letter of the law. See&#xD;
Tr. of Oral Arg. 36–37. All would concede this to be unre&#xD;
alistic, but the example underscores that the statutory&#xD;
eligibility of a juvenile offender for life without parole does&#xD;
not indicate that the penalty has been endorsed through&#xD;
deliberate, express, and full legislative consideration.&#xD;
Similarly, the many States that allow life without parole&#xD;
for juvenile nonhomicide offenders but do not impose the&#xD;
punishment should not be treated as if they have ex&#xD;
pressed the view that the sentence is appropriate. The&#xD;
sentencing practice now under consideration is exceed&#xD;
ingly rare. And “it is fair to say that a national consensus&#xD;
has developed against it.” Atkins, supra, at 316.&#xD;
                                B&#xD;
  Community consensus, while “entitled to great weight,”&#xD;
is not itself determinative of whether a punishment is&#xD;
cruel and unusual. Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at&#xD;
24). In accordance with the constitutional design, “the&#xD;
task of interpreting the Eighth Amendment remains our&#xD;
responsibility.” Roper, 543 U. S., at 575. The judicial&#xD;
exercise of independent judgment requires consideration&#xD;
of the culpability of the offenders at issue in light of their&#xD;
crimes and characteristics, along with the severity of the&#xD;
punishment in question. Id., at 568; Kennedy, supra, at&#xD;
___ (slip op., at 27–28); cf. Solem, 463 U. S., at 292. In this&#xD;

sentencing practice serves legitimate penological goals.&#xD;
Kennedy, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 30–36); Roper, supra, at&#xD;
571–572; Atkins, supra, at 318–320.&#xD;
   Roper established that because juveniles have lessened&#xD;
culpability they are less deserving of the most severe&#xD;
punishments. 543 U. S., at 569. As compared to adults,&#xD;
juveniles have a “ ‘lack of maturity and an underdeveloped&#xD;
sense of responsibility’ ”; they “are more vulnerable or&#xD;
susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures,&#xD;
including peer pressure”; and their characters are “not as&#xD;
well formed.” Id., at 569–570. These salient characteris&#xD;
tics mean that “[i]t is difficult even for expert psycholo&#xD;
gists to differentiate between the juvenile offender whose&#xD;
crime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, and&#xD;
the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable&#xD;
corruption.” Id., at 573. Accordingly, “juvenile offenders&#xD;
cannot with reliability be classified among the worst of&#xD;
fenders.” Id., at 569. A juvenile is not absolved of respon&#xD;
sibility for his actions, but his transgression “is not as&#xD;
morally reprehensible as that of an adult.” Thompson,&#xD;
supra, at 835 (plurality opinion).&#xD;
   No recent data provide reason to reconsider the Court’s&#xD;
observations in Roper about the nature of juveniles. As&#xD;
petitioner’s amici point out, developments in psychology&#xD;
and brain science continue to show fundamental differ&#xD;
ences between juvenile and adult minds. For example,&#xD;
parts of the brain involved in behavior control continue to&#xD;
mature through late adolescence. See Brief for American&#xD;
Medical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 16–24; Brief for&#xD;
American Psychological Association et al. as Amici Curiae&#xD;
22–27. Juveniles are more capable of change than are&#xD;
adults, and their actions are less likely to be evidence of&#xD;
“irretrievably depraved character” than are the actions of&#xD;
adults. Roper, 543 U. S., at 570. It remains true that&#xD;
“[f]rom a moral standpoint it would be misguided to&#xD;

&#xD;
equate the failings of a minor with those of an adult, for a&#xD;
greater possibility exists that a minor’s character deficien&#xD;
cies will be reformed.” Ibid. These matters relate to the&#xD;
status of the offenders in question; and it is relevant to&#xD;
consider next the nature of the offenses to which this&#xD;
harsh penalty might apply.&#xD;
  The Court has recognized that defendants who do not&#xD;
kill, intend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are&#xD;
categorically less deserving of the most serious forms of&#xD;
punishment than are murderers. Kennedy, supra; En&#xD;
mund, 458 U. S. 782; Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S. 137&#xD;
(1987); Coker, 433 U. S. 584. There is a line “between&#xD;
homicide and other serious violent offenses against the&#xD;
individual.” Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 27).&#xD;
Serious nonhomicide crimes “may be devastating in their&#xD;
harm . . . but ‘in terms of moral depravity and of the injury&#xD;
to the person and to the public,’ . . . they cannot be com&#xD;
pared to murder in their ‘severity and irrevocability.’ ” Id.,&#xD;
at ___ (slip op., at 28) (quoting Coker, 433 U. S., at 598&#xD;
(plurality opinion)). This is because “[l]ife is over for the&#xD;
victim of the murderer,” but for the victim of even a very&#xD;
serious nonhomicide crime, “life . . . is not over and nor&#xD;
mally is not beyond repair.” Ibid. (plurality opinion).&#xD;
Although an offense like robbery or rape is “a serious&#xD;
crime deserving serious punishment,” Enmund, supra, at&#xD;
797, those crimes differ from homicide crimes in a moral&#xD;
sense.&#xD;
  It follows that, when compared to an adult murderer, a&#xD;
juvenile offender who did not kill or intend to kill has a&#xD;
twice diminished moral culpability.        The age of the&#xD;
offender and the nature of the crime each bear on the&#xD;
analysis.&#xD;
  As for the punishment, life without parole is “the second&#xD;
most severe penalty permitted by law.” Harmelin, 501&#xD;
U. S., at 1001 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). It is true that a&#xD;
death sentence is “unique in its severity and irrevocabil&#xD;

&#xD;
ity,” Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 187 (1976) (joint&#xD;
opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.); yet life&#xD;
without parole sentences share some characteristics with&#xD;
death sentences that are shared by no other sentences.&#xD;
The State does not execute the offender sentenced to life&#xD;
without parole, but the sentence alters the offender’s life&#xD;
by a forfeiture that is irrevocable. It deprives the convict&#xD;
of the most basic liberties without giving hope of restora&#xD;
tion, except perhaps by executive clemency—the remote&#xD;
possibility of which does not mitigate the harshness of the&#xD;
sentence. Solem, 463 U. S., at 300–301. As one court&#xD;
observed in overturning a life without parole sentence for&#xD;
a juvenile defendant, this sentence “means denial of hope;&#xD;
it means that good behavior and character improvement&#xD;
are immaterial; it means that whatever the future might&#xD;
hold in store for the mind and spirit of [the convict], he&#xD;
will remain in prison for the rest of his days.” Naovarath&#xD;
v. State, &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/nev/6Z5f/naovarath-v-state/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;105&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Nev.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;525&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;pre class="inline"&gt;, 526, 779 P. 2d 944 (1989).&#xD;
   The Court has recognized the severity of sentences that&#xD;
deny convicts the possibility of parole. In Rummel, 445&#xD;
U. S. 263, the Court rejected an Eighth Amendment chal&#xD;
lenge to a life sentence for a defendant’s third nonviolent&#xD;
felony but stressed that the sentence gave the defendant&#xD;
the possibility of parole. Noting that “parole is an estab&#xD;
lished variation on imprisonment of convicted criminals,”&#xD;
it was evident that an analysis of the petitioner’s sentence&#xD;
“could hardly ignore the possibility that he will not actu&#xD;
ally be imprisoned for the rest of his life.” Id., at 280–281&#xD;
(internal quotation marks omitted). And in Solem, the&#xD;
only previous case striking down a sentence for a term of&#xD;
years as grossly disproportionate, the defendant’s sentence&#xD;
was deemed “far more severe than the life sentence we&#xD;
considered in Rummel,” because it did not give the defen&#xD;
dant the possibility of parole. 463 U. S., at 297.&#xD;
   Life without parole is an especially harsh punishment&#xD;
for a juvenile. Under this sentence a juvenile offender will&#xD;

&#xD;
                Appendix to opinion of the Court&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
on average serve more years and a greater percentage of&#xD;
his life in prison than an adult offender. A 16-year-old&#xD;
and a 75-year-old each sentenced to life without parole&#xD;
receive the same punishment in name only. See Roper,&#xD;
supra, at 572; cf. Harmelin, supra, at 996 (“In some cases&#xD;
. . . there will be negligible difference between life without&#xD;
parole and other sentences of imprisonment—for example,&#xD;
. . . a lengthy term sentence without eligibility for parole,&#xD;
given to a 65-year-old man”). This reality cannot be&#xD;
ignored.&#xD;
    The penological justifications for the sentencing practice&#xD;
are also relevant to the analysis. Kennedy, supra, at ___&#xD;
(slip op., at 30–36); Roper, 543 U. S., at 571–572; Atkins,&#xD;
supra, at 318–320. Criminal punishment can have differ&#xD;
ent goals, and choosing among them is within a legisla&#xD;
ture’s discretion. See Harmelin, supra, at 999 (opinion of&#xD;
KENNEDY, J.) (“[T]he Eighth Amendment does not man&#xD;
date adoption of any one penological theory”). It does not&#xD;
follow, however, that the purposes and effects of penal&#xD;
sanctions are irrelevant to the determination of Eighth&#xD;
Amendment restrictions. A sentence lacking any legiti&#xD;
mate penological justification is by its nature dispropor&#xD;
tionate to the offense. With respect to life without parole&#xD;
for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, none of the goals of&#xD;
penal sanctions that have been recognized as legitimate—&#xD;
retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation,&#xD;
see Ewing, 538 U. S., at 25 (plurality opinion)—provides&#xD;
an adequate justification.&#xD;
    Retribution is a legitimate reason to punish, but it&#xD;
cannot support the sentence at issue here. Society is&#xD;
entitled to impose severe sanctions on a juvenile nonhomi&#xD;
cide offender to express its condemnation of the crime and&#xD;
to seek restoration of the moral imbalance caused by the&#xD;
offense. But “[t]he heart of the retribution rationale is&#xD;
that a criminal sentence must be directly related to the&#xD;
personal culpability of the criminal offender.” Tison, 481&#xD;
                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           21&#xD;

                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
U. S., at 149. And as Roper observed, “[w]hether viewed&#xD;
as an attempt to express the community’s moral outrage&#xD;
or as an attempt to right the balance for the wrong to the&#xD;
victim, the case for retribution is not as strong with a&#xD;
minor as with an adult.” 543 U. S., at 571. The case&#xD;
becomes even weaker with respect to a juvenile who did&#xD;
not commit homicide. Roper found that “[r]etribution is&#xD;
not proportional if the law’s most severe penalty is im&#xD;
posed” on the juvenile murderer. Ibid. The considerations&#xD;
underlying that holding support as well the conclusion&#xD;
that retribution does not justify imposing the second most&#xD;
severe penalty on the less culpable juvenile nonhomicide&#xD;
offender.&#xD;
   Deterrence does not suffice to justify the sentence ei&#xD;
ther. Roper noted that “the same characteristics that&#xD;
render juveniles less culpable than adults suggest . . . that&#xD;
juveniles will be less susceptible to deterrence.” Ibid.&#xD;
Because juveniles’ “lack of maturity and underdeveloped&#xD;
sense of responsibility . . . often result in impetuous and&#xD;
ill-considered actions and decisions,” Johnson v. Texas,&#xD;
509 U. S. 350, 367 (1993), they are less likely to take a&#xD;
possible punishment into consideration when making&#xD;
decisions. This is particularly so when that punishment is&#xD;
rarely imposed. That the sentence deters in a few cases is&#xD;
perhaps plausible, but “[t]his argument does not overcome&#xD;
other objections.” Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at&#xD;
31). Even if the punishment has some connection to a&#xD;
valid penological goal, it must be shown that the punish&#xD;
ment is not grossly disproportionate in light of the justifi&#xD;
cation offered. Here, in light of juvenile nonhomicide&#xD;
offenders’ diminished moral responsibility, any limited&#xD;
deterrent effect provided by life without parole is not&#xD;
enough to justify the sentence.&#xD;
   Incapacitation, a third legitimate reason for imprison&#xD;
ment, does not justify the life without parole sentence in&#xD;
question here. Recidivism is a serious risk to public&#xD;

&#xD;
                Appendix to opinion of the Court&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
safety, and so incapacitation is an important goal. See&#xD;
Ewing, supra, at 26 (plurality opinion) (statistics show 67&#xD;
percent of former inmates released from state prisons are&#xD;
charged with at least one serious new crime within three&#xD;
years). But while incapacitation may be a legitimate&#xD;
penological goal sufficient to justify life without parole in&#xD;
other contexts, it is inadequate to justify that punishment&#xD;
for juveniles who did not commit homicide. To justify life&#xD;
without parole on the assumption that the juvenile of&#xD;
fender forever will be a danger to society requires the&#xD;
sentencer to make a judgment that the juvenile is incorri&#xD;
gible. The characteristics of juveniles make that judgment&#xD;
questionable. “It is difficult even for expert psychologists&#xD;
to differentiate between the juvenile offender whose crime&#xD;
reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, and the&#xD;
rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable&#xD;
corruption.” Roper, supra, at 573. As one court concluded&#xD;
in a challenge to a life without parole sentence for a 14&#xD;
year-old, “incorrigibility is inconsistent with youth.”&#xD;
Workman v. Commonwealth, 429 S. W. 2d 374, 378 (Ky.&#xD;
App. 1968).&#xD;
   Here one cannot dispute that this defendant posed an&#xD;
immediate risk, for he had committed, we can assume,&#xD;
serious crimes early in his term of supervised release and&#xD;
despite his own assurances of reform. Graham deserved&#xD;
to be separated from society for some time in order to&#xD;
prevent what the trial court described as an “escalating&#xD;
pattern of criminal conduct,” App. 394, but it does not&#xD;
follow that he would be a risk to society for the rest of his&#xD;
life. Even if the State’s judgment that Graham was incor&#xD;
rigible were later corroborated by prison misbehavior or&#xD;
failure to mature, the sentence was still disproportionate&#xD;
because that judgment was made at the outset. A life&#xD;
without parole sentence improperly denies the juvenile&#xD;
offender a chance to demonstrate growth and maturity.&#xD;
Incapacitation cannot override all other considerations,&#xD;

                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
lest the Eighth Amendment’s rule against disproportion&#xD;
ate sentences be a nullity.&#xD;
   Finally there is rehabilitation, a penological goal that&#xD;
forms the basis of parole systems. See Solem, 463 U. S., at&#xD;
300; Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 363 (1989).&#xD;
The concept of rehabilitation is imprecise; and its utility&#xD;
and proper implementation are the subject of a substan&#xD;
tial, dynamic field of inquiry and dialogue. See, e.g., Cul&#xD;
len &amp; Gendreau, Assessing Correctional Rehabilitation:&#xD;
Policy, Practice, and Prospects, 3 Criminal Justice 2000,&#xD;
pp. 119–133 (2000) (describing scholarly debates regarding&#xD;
the effectiveness of rehabilitation over the last several&#xD;
decades). It is for legislatures to determine what rehabili&#xD;
tative techniques are appropriate and effective.&#xD;
   A sentence of life imprisonment without parole, how&#xD;
ever, cannot be justified by the goal of rehabilitation. The&#xD;
penalty forswears altogether the rehabilitative ideal. By&#xD;
denying the defendant the right to reenter the community,&#xD;
the State makes an irrevocable judgment about that per&#xD;
son’s value and place in society. This judgment is not&#xD;
appropriate in light of a juvenile nonhomicide offender’s&#xD;
capacity for change and limited moral culpability. A&#xD;
State’s rejection of rehabilitation, moreover, goes beyond a&#xD;
mere expressive judgment. As one amicus notes, defen&#xD;
dants serving life without parole sentences are often de&#xD;
nied access to vocational training and other rehabilitative&#xD;
services that are available to other inmates. See Brief for&#xD;
Sentencing Project as Amicus Curiae 11–13. For juvenile&#xD;
offenders, who are most in need of and receptive to reha&#xD;
bilitation, see Brief for J. Lawrence Aber et al. as Amici&#xD;
Curiae 28–31 (hereinafter Aber Brief), the absence of&#xD;
rehabilitative opportunities or treatment makes the dis&#xD;
proportionality of the sentence all the more evident.&#xD;
   In sum, penological theory is not adequate to justify life&#xD;
without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders. This&#xD;
determination; the limited culpability of juvenile non&#xD;

&#xD;
                Appendix to opinion of the Court&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
homicide offenders; and the severity of life without parole&#xD;
sentences all lead to the conclusion that the sentencing&#xD;
practice under consideration is cruel and unusual. This&#xD;
Court now holds that for a juvenile offender who did not&#xD;
commit homicide the Eighth Amendment forbids the&#xD;
sentence of life without parole. This clear line is necessary&#xD;
to prevent the possibility that life without parole sen&#xD;
tences will be imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders&#xD;
who are not sufficiently culpable to merit that punish&#xD;
ment. Because “[t]he age of 18 is the point where society&#xD;
draws the line for many purposes between childhood and&#xD;
adulthood,” those who were below that age when the&#xD;
offense was committed may not be sentenced to life with&#xD;
out parole for a nonhomicide crime. Roper, 543 U. S., at&#xD;
574.&#xD;
  A State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom to&#xD;
a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide crime.&#xD;
What the State must do, however, is give defendants like&#xD;
Graham some meaningful opportunity to obtain release&#xD;
based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation. It is&#xD;
for the State, in the first instance, to explore the means&#xD;
and mechanisms for compliance. It bears emphasis, how&#xD;
ever, that while the Eighth Amendment forbids a State&#xD;
from imposing a life without parole sentence on a juvenile&#xD;
nonhomicide offender, it does not require the State to&#xD;
release that offender during his natural life. Those who&#xD;
commit truly horrifying crimes as juveniles may turn out&#xD;
to be irredeemable, and thus deserving of incarceration for&#xD;
the duration of their lives. The Eighth Amendment does&#xD;
not foreclose the possibility that persons convicted of&#xD;
nonhomicide crimes committed before adulthood will&#xD;
remain behind bars for life. It does forbid States from&#xD;
making the judgment at the outset that those offenders&#xD;
never will be fit to reenter society.&#xD;

                              C&#xD;
   Categorical rules tend to be imperfect, but one is neces&#xD;
sary here. Two alternative approaches are not adequate&#xD;
to address the relevant constitutional concerns. First, the&#xD;
State argues that the laws of Florida and other States&#xD;
governing criminal procedure take sufficient account of&#xD;
the age of a juvenile offender. Here, Florida notes that&#xD;
under its law prosecutors are required to charge 16- and&#xD;
17-year-old offenders as adults only for certain serious&#xD;
felonies; that prosecutors have discretion to charge those&#xD;
offenders as adults for other felonies; and that prosecutors&#xD;
may not charge nonrecidivist 16- and 17-year-old offenders&#xD;
as adults for misdemeanors. Brief for Respondent 54&#xD;
(citing Fla. Stat. §985.227 (2003)). The State also stresses&#xD;
that “in only the narrowest of circumstances” does Florida&#xD;
law impose no age limit whatsoever for prosecuting juve&#xD;
niles in adult court. Brief for Respondent 54.&#xD;
   Florida is correct to say that state laws requiring con&#xD;
sideration of a defendant’s age in charging decisions are&#xD;
salutary. An offender’s age is relevant to the Eighth&#xD;
Amendment, and criminal procedure laws that fail to take&#xD;
defendants’ youthfulness into account at all would be&#xD;
flawed. Florida, like other States, has made substantial&#xD;
efforts to enact comprehensive rules governing the treat&#xD;
ment of youthful offenders by its criminal justice system.&#xD;
See generally Fla. Stat. §958 et seq. (2007).&#xD;
   The provisions the State notes are, nonetheless, by&#xD;
themselves insufficient to address the constitutional con&#xD;
cerns at issue. Nothing in Florida’s laws prevents its&#xD;
courts from sentencing a juvenile nonhomicide offender to&#xD;
life without parole based on a subjective judgment that the&#xD;
defendant’s crimes demonstrate an “irretrievably de&#xD;
praved character.” Roper, supra, at 570. This is inconsis&#xD;
tent with the Eighth Amendment. Specific cases are&#xD;
illustrative. In Graham’s case the sentencing judge de&#xD;
cided to impose life without parole—a sentence greater&#xD;

&#xD;
than that requested by the prosecutor—for Graham’s&#xD;
armed burglary conviction. The judge did so because he&#xD;
concluded that Graham was incorrigible: “[Y]ou decided&#xD;
that this is how you were going to lead your life and that&#xD;
there is nothing that we can do for you. . . . We can’t do&#xD;
anything to deter you.” App. 394.&#xD;
   Another example comes from Sullivan v. Florida,&#xD;
No. 08–7621. Sullivan was argued the same day as this&#xD;
case, but the Court has now dismissed the writ of certio&#xD;
rari in Sullivan as improvidently granted. Post, p. ___.&#xD;
The facts, however, demonstrate the flaws of Florida’s&#xD;
system. The petitioner, Joe Sullivan, was prosecuted as&#xD;
an adult for a sexual assault committed when he was 13&#xD;
years old. Noting Sullivan’s past encounters with the law,&#xD;
the sentencing judge concluded that, although Sullivan&#xD;
had been “given opportunity after opportunity to upright&#xD;
himself and take advantage of the second and third&#xD;
chances he’s been given,” he had demonstrated himself to&#xD;
be unwilling to follow the law and needed to be kept away&#xD;
from society for the duration of his life. Brief for Respon&#xD;
dent in Sullivan v. Florida, O. T. 2009, No. 08–7621, p. 6.&#xD;
The judge sentenced Sullivan to life without parole. As&#xD;
these examples make clear, existing state laws, allowing&#xD;
the imposition of these sentences based only on a discre&#xD;
tionary, subjective judgment by a judge or jury that the&#xD;
offender is irredeemably depraved, are insufficient to&#xD;
prevent the possibility that the offender will receive a life&#xD;
without parole sentence for which he or she lacks the&#xD;
moral culpability.&#xD;
   Another possible approach would be to hold that the&#xD;
Eighth Amendment requires courts to take the offender’s&#xD;
age into consideration as part of a case-specific gross&#xD;
disproportionality inquiry, weighing it against the seri&#xD;
ousness of the crime. This approach would allow courts to&#xD;
account for factual differences between cases and to im&#xD;
pose life without parole sentences for particularly heinous&#xD;

crimes. Few, perhaps no, judicial responsibilities are more&#xD;
difficult than sentencing. The task is usually undertaken&#xD;
by trial judges who seek with diligence and professional&#xD;
ism to take account of the human existence of the offender&#xD;
and the just demands of a wronged society.&#xD;
   The case-by-case approach to sentencing must, however,&#xD;
be confined by some boundaries. The dilemma of juvenile&#xD;
sentencing demonstrates this. For even if we were to&#xD;
assume that some juvenile nonhomicide offenders might&#xD;
have “sufficient psychological maturity, and at the same&#xD;
time demonstrat[e] sufficient depravity,” Roper, 543 U. S.,&#xD;
at 572, to merit a life without parole sentence, it does not&#xD;
follow that courts taking a case-by-case proportionality&#xD;
approach could with sufficient accuracy distinguish the&#xD;
few incorrigible juvenile offenders from the many that&#xD;
have the capacity for change. Roper rejected the argument&#xD;
that the Eighth Amendment required only that juries be&#xD;
told they must consider the defendant’s age as a mitigat&#xD;
ing factor in sentencing. The Court concluded that an&#xD;
“unacceptable likelihood exists that the brutality or cold&#xD;
blooded nature of any particular crime would overpower&#xD;
mitigating arguments based on youth as a matter of&#xD;
course, even where the juvenile offender’s objective imma&#xD;
turity, vulnerability, and lack of true depravity should&#xD;
require a sentence less severe than death.” Id., at 573.&#xD;
Here, as with the death penalty, “[t]he differences between&#xD;
juvenile and adult offenders are too marked and well&#xD;
understood to risk allowing a youthful person to receive” a&#xD;
sentence of life without parole for a nonhomicide crime&#xD;
“despite insufficient culpability.” Id., at 572–573.&#xD;
   Another problem with a case-by-case approach is that it&#xD;
does not take account of special difficulties encountered by&#xD;
counsel in juvenile representation. As some amici note,&#xD;
the features that distinguish juveniles from adults also&#xD;
put them at a significant disadvantage in criminal pro&#xD;
ceedings. Juveniles mistrust adults and have limited&#xD;

understandings of the criminal justice system and the&#xD;
roles of the institutional actors within it. They are less&#xD;

aid in their defense. Brief for NAACP Legal Defense &amp;&#xD;

Loyalty, Paternalism, and Rights: Client Counseling&#xD;
Theory and the Role of Child’s Counsel in Delinquency&#xD;
Cases, 81 Notre Dame L. Rev. 245, 272–273 (2005). Diffi&#xD;
culty in weighing long-term consequences; a corresponding&#xD;
impulsiveness; and reluctance to trust defense counsel&#xD;
seen as part of the adult world a rebellious youth rejects,&#xD;
all can lead to poor decisions by one charged with a juve&#xD;
nile offense. Aber Brief 35. These factors are likely to&#xD;
impair the quality of a juvenile defendant’s representa&#xD;
tion. Cf. Atkins, 536 U. S., at 320 (“Mentally retarded&#xD;
defendants may be less able to give meaningful assistance&#xD;
to their counsel”). A categorical rule avoids the risk that,&#xD;
as a result of these difficulties, a court or jury will errone&#xD;
ously conclude that a particular juvenile is sufficiently&#xD;
culpable to deserve life without parole for a nonhomicide.&#xD;
   Finally, a categorical rule gives all juvenile nonhomicide&#xD;
offenders a chance to demonstrate maturity and reform.&#xD;
The juvenile should not be deprived of the opportunity to&#xD;
achieve maturity of judgment and self-recognition of hu&#xD;
man worth and potential. In Roper, that deprivation&#xD;
resulted from an execution that brought life to its end.&#xD;
Here, though by a different dynamic, the same concerns&#xD;
apply. Life in prison without the possibility of parole gives&#xD;
no chance for fulfillment outside prison walls, no chance&#xD;
for reconciliation with society, no hope. Maturity can lead&#xD;
to that considered reflection which is the foundation for&#xD;
remorse, renewal, and rehabilitation. A young person who&#xD;
knows that he or she has no chance to leave prison before&#xD;
life’s end has little incentive to become a responsible indi&#xD;
vidual. In some prisons, moreover, the system itself be&#xD;
comes complicit in the lack of development. As noted&#xD;

above, see supra, at 23, it is the policy in some prisons to&#xD;
withhold counseling, education, and rehabilitation pro&#xD;
grams for those who are ineligible for parole consideration.&#xD;
A categorical rule against life without parole for juvenile&#xD;
nonhomicide offenders avoids the perverse consequence in&#xD;
which the lack of maturity that led to an offender’s crime&#xD;
is reinforced by the prison term.&#xD;
   Terrance Graham’s sentence guarantees he will die in&#xD;
prison without any meaningful opportunity to obtain&#xD;
release, no matter what he might do to demonstrate that&#xD;
the bad acts he committed as a teenager are not represen&#xD;
tative of his true character, even if he spends the next half&#xD;
century attempting to atone for his crimes and learn from&#xD;
his mistakes. The State has denied him any chance to&#xD;
later demonstrate that he is fit to rejoin society based&#xD;
solely on a nonhomicide crime that he committed while he&#xD;
was a child in the eyes of the law. This the Eighth&#xD;
Amendment does not permit.&#xD;
                                D&#xD;
   There is support for our conclusion in the fact that, in&#xD;
continuing to impose life without parole sentences on&#xD;
juveniles who did not commit homicide, the United States&#xD;
adheres to a sentencing practice rejected the world over.&#xD;
This observation does not control our decision. The judg&#xD;
ments of other nations and the international community&#xD;
are not dispositive as to the meaning of the Eighth&#xD;
Amendment. But “ ‘[t]he climate of international opinion&#xD;
concerning the acceptability of a particular punishment’ ”&#xD;
is also “ ‘not irrelevant.’ ” Enmund, 458 U. S., at 796, n. 22.&#xD;
The Court has looked beyond our Nation’s borders for&#xD;
support for its independent conclusion that a particular&#xD;
punishment is cruel and unusual. See, e.g., Roper, 543&#xD;
U. S., at 575–578; Atkins, supra, at 317–318, n. 21;&#xD;
Thompson, 487 U. S., at 830 (plurality opinion); Enmund,&#xD;

   Today we continue that longstanding practice in noting&#xD;
the global consensus against the sentencing practice in&#xD;
question. A recent study concluded that only 11 nations&#xD;
authorize life without parole for juvenile offenders under&#xD;
any circumstances; and only 2 of them, the United States&#xD;
and Israel, ever impose the punishment in practice. See&#xD;
M. Leighton &amp; C. de la Vega, Sentencing Our Children to&#xD;
Die in Prison: Global Law and Practice 4 (2007). An up&#xD;
dated version of the study concluded that Israel’s “laws&#xD;
allow for parole review of juvenile offenders serving life&#xD;
terms,” but expressed reservations about how that parole&#xD;
review is implemented. De la Vega &amp; Leighton, Sentenc&#xD;
ing Our Children to Die in Prison: Global Law and Prac&#xD;
tice, 42 U. S. F. L. Rev. 983, 1002–1003 (2008). But even if&#xD;
Israel is counted as allowing life without parole for juve&#xD;
nile offenders, that nation does not appear to impose that&#xD;
sentence for nonhomicide crimes; all of the seven Israeli&#xD;
prisoners whom commentators have identified as serving&#xD;
life sentences for juvenile crimes were convicted of homi&#xD;
cide or attempted homicide. See Amnesty International,&#xD;
Human Rights Watch, The Rest of Their Lives: Life with&#xD;

brary (Feb. 16, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court’s case&#xD;
file).&#xD;
   Thus, as petitioner contends and respondent does not&#xD;
contest, the United States is the only Nation that imposes&#xD;
life without parole sentences on juvenile nonhomicide&#xD;
offenders. We also note, as petitioner and his amici em&#xD;
phasize, that Article 37(a) of the United Nations Conven&#xD;
tion on the Rights of the Child, Nov. 20, 1989, 1577&#xD;

                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
hibits the imposition of “life imprisonment without possi&#xD;
bility of release . . . for offences committed by persons&#xD;
below eighteen years of age.” Brief for Petitioner 66; Brief&#xD;
for Amnesty International et al. as Amici Curiae 15–17.&#xD;
As we concluded in Roper with respect to the juvenile&#xD;
death penalty, “the United States now stands alone in a&#xD;
world that has turned its face against” life without parole&#xD;
for juvenile nonhomicide offenders. 543 U. S., at 577.&#xD;
   The State’s amici stress that no international legal&#xD;
agreement that is binding on the United States prohibits&#xD;
life without parole for juvenile offenders and thus urge us&#xD;
to ignore the international consensus. See Brief for Soli&#xD;
darity Center for Law and Justice et al. as Amici Curiae&#xD;
14–16; Brief for Sixteen Members of United States House&#xD;
of Representatives as Amici Curiae 40–43. These argu&#xD;
ments miss the mark. The question before us is not&#xD;
whether international law prohibits the United States&#xD;
from imposing the sentence at issue in this case. The&#xD;
question is whether that punishment is cruel and unusual.&#xD;
In that inquiry, “the overwhelming weight of international&#xD;
opinion against” life without parole for nonhomicide of&#xD;
fenses committed by juveniles “provide[s] respected and&#xD;
significant confirmation for our own conclusions.” Roper,&#xD;
supra, at 578.&#xD;
   The debate between petitioner’s and respondent’s amici&#xD;
over whether there is a binding jus cogens norm against&#xD;
this sentencing practice is likewise of no import. See Brief&#xD;
for Amnesty International 10–23; Brief for Sixteen Mem&#xD;
bers of United States House of Representatives 4–40. The&#xD;
Court has treated the laws and practices of other nations&#xD;
and international agreements as relevant to the Eighth&#xD;
Amendment not because those norms are binding or con&#xD;
trolling but because the judgment of the world’s nations&#xD;
that a particular sentencing practice is inconsistent with&#xD;
basic principles of decency demonstrates that the Court’s&#xD;
rationale has respected reasoning to support it.&#xD;

  The Constitution prohibits the imposition of a life with&#xD;
out parole sentence on a juvenile offender who did not&#xD;
commit homicide. A State need not guarantee the offender&#xD;
eventual release, but if it imposes a sentence of life it must&#xD;
provide him or her with some realistic opportunity to&#xD;
obtain release before the end of that term. The judgment&#xD;
of the First District Court of Appeal of Florida affirming&#xD;
Graham’s conviction is reversed, and the case is remanded&#xD;
for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.&#xD;

                                                   It is so ordered.&#xD;

   JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG and&#xD;

   In his dissenting opinion, JUSTICE THOMAS argues that&#xD;
today’s holding is not entirely consistent with the control&#xD;

Ewing v. California, 538 U. S. 11 (2003), Harmelin v.&#xD;

standards of decency” have played a central role in our&#xD;
Eighth Amendment jurisprudence for at least a century,&#xD;
see Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 373–378 (1910),&#xD;
this argument suggests the dissenting opinions in those&#xD;
cases more accurately describe the law today than does&#xD;
JUSTICE THOMAS’ rigid interpretation of the Amendment.&#xD;
Society changes. Knowledge accumulates. We learn,&#xD;
sometimes, from our mistakes. Punishments that did not&#xD;
seem cruel and unusual at one time may, in the light of&#xD;
reason and experience, be found cruel and unusual at a&#xD;
later time; unless we are to abandon the moral commit&#xD;
ment embodied in the Eighth Amendment, proportionality&#xD;
review must never become effectively obsolete, post, at&#xD;
8–9, and n. 2.&#xD;
   While JUSTICE THOMAS would apparently not rule out a&#xD;
death sentence for a $50 theft by a 7-year-old, see post, at&#xD;

                 FLORIDA &#xD;
&#xD;
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL&#xD;
              OF FLORIDA, FIRST DISTRICT&#xD;
                        [May 17, 2010]&#xD;
&#xD;
   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, concurring in the judgment.&#xD;
   I agree with the Court that Terrance Graham’s sentence&#xD;
of life without parole violates the Eighth Amendment’s&#xD;
prohibition on “cruel and unusual punishments.” Unlike&#xD;
the majority, however, I see no need to invent a new con&#xD;
stitutional rule of dubious provenance in reaching that&#xD;
conclusion. Instead, my analysis is based on an applica&#xD;
tion of this Court’s precedents, in particular (1) our cases&#xD;
requiring “narrow proportionality” review of noncapital&#xD;
sentences and (2) our conclusion in Roper v. Simmons, 543&#xD;
U. S. 551 (2005), that juvenile offenders are generally less&#xD;
culpable than adults who commit the same crimes.&#xD;
   These cases expressly allow courts addressing allega&#xD;
tions that a noncapital sentence violates the Eighth&#xD;
Amendment to consider the particular defendant and&#xD;
particular crime at issue. The standards for relief under&#xD;
these precedents are rigorous, and should be. But here&#xD;
Graham’s juvenile status—together with the nature of his&#xD;
criminal conduct and the extraordinarily severe punish&#xD;
ment imposed—lead me to conclude that his sentence of&#xD;
life without parole is unconstitutional.&#xD;
                           I&#xD;
  Our Court has struggled with whether and how to apply&#xD;
the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause to sentences&#xD;
2                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&#xD;
&#xD;
             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
for noncapital crimes. Some of my colleagues have raised&#xD;
serious and thoughtful questions about whether, as an&#xD;
original matter, the Constitution was understood to re&#xD;
quire any degree of proportionality between noncapital&#xD;
offenses and their corresponding punishments. See, e.g.,&#xD;
Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 962–994 (1991)&#xD;
(principal opinion of SCALIA, J.); post, at 3–5, and n. 1&#xD;
(THOMAS, J., dissenting). Neither party here asks us to&#xD;
reexamine our precedents requiring such proportionality,&#xD;
however, and so I approach this case by trying to apply&#xD;
our past decisions to the facts at hand.&#xD;
                              A&#xD;
   Graham’s case arises at the intersection of two lines of&#xD;
Eighth Amendment precedent. The first consists of deci&#xD;
sions holding that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments&#xD;
Clause embraces a “narrow proportionality principle” that&#xD;
we apply, on a case-by-case basis, when asked to review&#xD;
noncapital sentences. Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 72&#xD;
(2003) (internal quotation marks omitted); Solem v. Helm,&#xD;
463 U. S. 277, 290 (1983); Ewing v. California, 538 U. S.&#xD;
11, 20 (2003) (plurality opinion); Harmelin, supra, at 996–&#xD;
997 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in&#xD;
judgment). This “narrow proportionality principle” does&#xD;
not grant judges blanket authority to second-guess deci&#xD;
sions made by legislatures or sentencing courts. On the&#xD;
contrary, a reviewing court will only “rarely” need “to&#xD;
engage in extended analysis to determine that a sentence&#xD;
is not constitutionally disproportionate,” Solem, supra, at&#xD;
290, n. 16 (emphasis added), and “successful challenges” to&#xD;
noncapital sentences will be all the more “exceedingly&#xD;
rare,” Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, 272 (1980).&#xD;
   We have “not established a clear or consistent path for&#xD;
courts to follow” in applying the highly deferential “narrow&#xD;
proportionality” analysis. Lockyer, supra, at 72. We have,&#xD;
however, emphasized the primacy of the legislature in&#xD;
                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             3&#xD;
&#xD;
              ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
setting sentences, the variety of legitimate penological&#xD;
schemes, the state-by-state diversity protected by our&#xD;
federal system, and the requirement that review be guided&#xD;
by objective, rather than subjective, factors. Ewing, supra,&#xD;
at 23 (plurality opinion); Harmelin, supra, at 998–1001&#xD;
(opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Most importantly, however, we&#xD;
have explained that the Eighth Amendment “ ‘does not&#xD;
require strict proportionality between crime and sen&#xD;
tence’ ”; rather, “ ‘it forbids only extreme sentences that are&#xD;
“grossly disproportionate” to the crime.’ ” Ewing, supra, at&#xD;
23 (plurality opinion) (quoting Harmelin, supra, at 1001&#xD;
(opinion of KENNEDY, J.)).&#xD;
   Our cases indicate that courts conducting “narrow pro&#xD;
portionality” review should begin with a threshold inquiry&#xD;
that compares “the gravity of the offense and the harsh&#xD;
ness of the penalty.” Solem, 463 U. S., at 290–291. This&#xD;
analysis can consider a particular offender’s mental state&#xD;
and motive in committing the crime, the actual harm&#xD;
caused to his victim or to society by his conduct, and any&#xD;
prior criminal history. Id., at 292–294, 296–297, and n. 22&#xD;
(considering motive, past criminal conduct, alcoholism,&#xD;
and propensity for violence of the particular defendant);&#xD;
see also Ewing, supra, at 28–30 (plurality opinion) (exam&#xD;
ining defendant’s criminal history); Harmelin, 501 U. S.,&#xD;
at 1001–1004 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (noting specific&#xD;
details of the particular crime of conviction).&#xD;
   Only in “the rare case in which a threshold comparison&#xD;
of the crime committed and the sentence imposed leads&#xD;
to an inference of gross disproportionality,” id., at 1005,&#xD;
should courts proceed to an “intrajurisdictional” compari&#xD;
son of the sentence at issue with those imposed on other&#xD;
criminals in the same jurisdiction, and an “interjurisdic&#xD;
tional” comparison with sentences imposed for the same&#xD;
crime in other jurisdictions. Solem, supra, at 291–292. If&#xD;
these subsequent comparisons confirm the inference of&#xD;
gross disproportionality, courts should invalidate the&#xD;
4                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&#xD;
&#xD;
             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
sentence as a violation of the Eighth Amendment.&#xD;
                              B&#xD;
   The second line of precedent relevant to assessing Gra&#xD;
ham’s sentence consists of our cases acknowledging that&#xD;
juvenile offenders are generally—though not necessarily in&#xD;
every case—less morally culpable than adults who commit&#xD;
the same crimes. This insight animated our decision in&#xD;
Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815 (1988), in which we&#xD;
invalidated a capital sentence imposed on a juvenile who&#xD;
had committed his crime under the age of 16. More re&#xD;
cently, in Roper, 543 U. S. 551, we extended the prohibi&#xD;
tion on executions to those who committed their crimes&#xD;
before the age of 18.&#xD;
   Both Thompson and Roper arose in the unique context&#xD;
of the death penalty, a punishment that our Court has&#xD;
recognized “must be limited to those offenders who commit&#xD;
‘a narrow category of the most serious crimes’ and whose&#xD;
extreme culpability makes them ‘the most deserving of&#xD;
execution.’ ” 543 U. S., at 568 (quoting Atkins v. Virginia,&#xD;
536 U. S. 304, 319 (2002)). Roper’s prohibition on the&#xD;
juvenile death penalty followed from our conclusion that&#xD;
“[t]hree general differences between juveniles under 18&#xD;
and adults demonstrate that juvenile offenders cannot&#xD;
with reliability be classified among the worst offenders.”&#xD;
543 U. S., at 569. These differences are a lack of maturity&#xD;
and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility, a height&#xD;
ened susceptibility to negative influences and outside&#xD;
pressures, and the fact that the character of a juvenile is&#xD;
“more transitory” and “less fixed” than that of an adult.&#xD;
Id., at 569–570. Together, these factors establish the&#xD;
“diminished culpability of juveniles,” id., at 571, and “ren&#xD;
der suspect any conclusion” that juveniles are among “the&#xD;
worst offenders” for whom the death penalty is reserved,&#xD;
id., at 570.&#xD;
   Today, the Court views Roper as providing the basis for&#xD;
                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           5&#xD;
&#xD;
              ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
a new categorical rule that juveniles may never receive a&#xD;
sentence of life without parole for nonhomicide crimes. I&#xD;
disagree. In Roper, the Court tailored its analysis of&#xD;
juvenile characteristics to the specific question whether&#xD;
juvenile offenders could constitutionally be subject to&#xD;
capital punishment. Our answer that they could not be&#xD;
sentenced to death was based on the explicit conclusion&#xD;
that they “cannot with reliability be classified among the&#xD;
worst offenders.” Id., at 569 (emphasis added).&#xD;
  This conclusion does not establish that juveniles can&#xD;
never be eligible for life without parole. A life sentence is&#xD;
of course far less severe than a death sentence, and we&#xD;
have never required that it be imposed only on the very&#xD;
worst offenders, as we have with capital punishment.&#xD;
Treating juvenile life sentences as analogous to capital&#xD;
punishment is at odds with our longstanding view that&#xD;
“the death penalty is different from other punishments in&#xD;
kind rather than degree.” Solem, supra, at 294. It is also&#xD;
at odds with Roper itself, which drew the line at capital&#xD;
punishment by blessing juvenile sentences that are “less&#xD;
severe than death” despite involving “forfeiture of some of&#xD;
the most basic liberties.” 543 U. S., at 573–574. Indeed,&#xD;
Roper explicitly relied on the possible imposition of life&#xD;
without parole on some juvenile offenders. Id., at 572.&#xD;
  But the fact that Roper does not support a categorical&#xD;
rule barring life sentences for all juveniles does not mean&#xD;
that a criminal defendant’s age is irrelevant to those&#xD;
sentences. On the contrary, our cases establish that the&#xD;
“narrow proportionality” review applicable to noncapital&#xD;
cases itself takes the personal “culpability of the offender”&#xD;
into account in examining whether a given punishment is&#xD;
proportionate to the crime. Solem, supra, at 292. There&#xD;
is no reason why an offender’s juvenile status should be&#xD;
excluded from the analysis. Indeed, given Roper’s conclu&#xD;
sion that juveniles are typically less blameworthy than&#xD;
adults, 543 U. S., at 571, an offender’s juvenile status can&#xD;
6                        GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&#xD;
&#xD;
                 ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
play a central role in the inquiry.&#xD;
   JUSTICE THOMAS disagrees with even our limited reli&#xD;
ance on Roper on the ground that the present case does&#xD;
not involve capital punishment. Post, at 26 (dissenting&#xD;
opinion). That distinction is important—indeed, it under&#xD;
lies our rejection of the categorical rule declared by the&#xD;
Court. But Roper’s conclusion that juveniles are typically&#xD;
less culpable than adults has pertinence beyond capital&#xD;
cases, and rightly informs the case-specific inquiry I be&#xD;
lieve to be appropriate here.&#xD;
   In short, our existing precedent already provides a&#xD;
sufficient framework for assessing the concerns outlined&#xD;
by the majority. Not every juvenile receiving a life sen&#xD;
tence will prevail under this approach. Not every juvenile&#xD;
should. But all will receive the protection that the Eighth&#xD;
Amendment requires.&#xD;
                            II&#xD;
  Applying the “narrow proportionality” framework to the&#xD;
particular facts of this case, I conclude that Graham’s&#xD;
sentence of life without parole violates the Eighth&#xD;
Amendment.*&#xD;
&#xD;
——————&#xD;
   * JUSTICE ALITO suggests that Graham has failed to preserve any&#xD;
challenge to his sentence based on the “narrow, as-applied proportional&#xD;
ity principle.” Post, at 1 (dissenting opinion). I disagree. It is true that&#xD;
Graham asks us to declare, categorically, that no juvenile convicted of a&#xD;
nonhomicide offense may ever be subject to a sentence of life without&#xD;
parole. But he claims that this rule is warranted under the narrow&#xD;
proportionality principle we set forth in Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277&#xD;
(1983), Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957 (1991), and Ewing v.&#xD;
California, 538 U. S. 11 (2003). Brief for Petitioner 30, 31, 54–64.&#xD;
Insofar as he relies on that framework, I believe we may do so as well,&#xD;
even if our analysis results in a narrower holding than the categori-&#xD;
cal rule Graham seeks. See also Reply Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 8&#xD;
(“[T]he Court could rule narrowly in this case and hold only that&#xD;
petitioner’s sentence of life without parole was unconstitutionally&#xD;
disproportionate”).&#xD;

&#xD;
             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
                              A&#xD;
   I begin with the threshold inquiry comparing the gravity&#xD;
of Graham’s conduct to the harshness of his penalty.&#xD;
There is no question that the crime for which Graham&#xD;
received his life sentence—armed burglary of a nondomicil&#xD;
with an assault or battery—is “a serious crime deserving&#xD;
serious punishment.” Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782,&#xD;
797 (1982). So too is the home invasion robbery that was&#xD;
the basis of Graham’s probation violation. But these&#xD;
crimes are certainly less serious than other crimes, such&#xD;
as murder or rape.&#xD;
   As for Graham’s degree of personal culpability, he com&#xD;
mitted the relevant offenses when he was a juvenile—a&#xD;
stage at which, Roper emphasized, one’s “culpability or&#xD;
blameworthiness is diminished, to a substantial degree, by&#xD;
reason of youth and immaturity.” 543 U. S., at 571. Gra&#xD;
ham’s age places him in a significantly different category&#xD;
from the defendants in Rummel, Harmelin, and Ewing, all&#xD;
of whom committed their crimes as adults. Graham’s&#xD;
youth made him relatively more likely to engage in reck&#xD;
less and dangerous criminal activity than an adult; it also&#xD;
likely enhanced his susceptibility to peer pressure. See,&#xD;
e.g., Roper, supra, at 569; Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350,&#xD;
367 (1993); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 115–117&#xD;
(1982). There is no reason to believe that Graham should&#xD;
be denied the general presumption of diminished culpabil&#xD;
ity that Roper indicates should apply to juvenile offenders.&#xD;
If anything, Graham’s in-court statements—including his&#xD;
request for a second chance so that he could “do whatever&#xD;
it takes to get to the NFL”—underscore his immaturity.&#xD;
App. 380.&#xD;
   The fact that Graham committed the crimes that he did&#xD;
proves that he was dangerous and deserved to be pun&#xD;
ished. But it does not establish that he was particularly&#xD;
dangerous—at least relative to the murderers and rapists&#xD;
for whom the sentence of life without parole is typically&#xD;
8                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&#xD;
&#xD;
             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
reserved. On the contrary, his lack of prior criminal con&#xD;
victions, his youth and immaturity, and the difficult cir&#xD;
cumstances of his upbringing noted by the majority, ante,&#xD;
at 1, all suggest that he was markedly less culpable than a&#xD;
typical adult who commits the same offenses.&#xD;
   Despite these considerations, the trial court sentenced&#xD;
Graham to life in prison without the possibility of parole.&#xD;
This is the second-harshest sentence available under our&#xD;
precedents for any crime, and the most severe sanction&#xD;
available for a nonhomicide offense. See Kennedy v. Lou&#xD;
isiana, 554 U. S. ___ (2008). Indeed, as the majority notes,&#xD;
Graham’s sentence far exceeded the punishment proposed&#xD;
by the Florida Department of Corrections (which sug&#xD;
gested a sentence of four years, Brief for Petitioner 20),&#xD;
and the state prosecutors (who asked that he be sentenced&#xD;
to 30 years in prison for the armed burglary, App. 388).&#xD;
No one in Graham’s case other than the sentencing judge&#xD;
appears to have believed that Graham deserved to go to&#xD;
prison for life.&#xD;
   Based on the foregoing circumstances, I conclude that&#xD;
there is a strong inference that Graham’s sentence of life&#xD;
imprisonment without parole was grossly disproportionate&#xD;
in violation of the Eighth Amendment. I therefore proceed&#xD;
to the next steps of the proportionality analysis.&#xD;
                              B&#xD;
   Both intrajurisdictional and interjurisdictional compari&#xD;
sons of Graham’s sentence confirm the threshold inference&#xD;
of disproportionality.&#xD;
   Graham’s sentence was far more severe than that im&#xD;
posed for similar violations of Florida law, even without&#xD;
taking juvenile status into account. For example, indi&#xD;
viduals who commit burglary or robbery offenses in Flor&#xD;
ida receive average sentences of less than 5 years and less&#xD;
than 10 years, respectively. Florida Dept. of Corrections,&#xD;

&#xD;
             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
tions in Florida 35. Unsurprisingly, Florida’s juvenile&#xD;
criminals receive similarly low sentences—typically less&#xD;
than five years for burglary and less than seven years for&#xD;
robbery. Id., at 36. Graham’s life without parole sentence&#xD;
was far more severe than the average sentence imposed on&#xD;
those convicted of murder or manslaughter, who typically&#xD;
receive under 25 years in prison. Id., at 35. As the Court&#xD;
explained in Solem, 463 U. S., at 291, “[i]f more serious&#xD;
crimes are subject to the same penalty, or to less serious&#xD;
penalties, that is some indication that the punishment at&#xD;
issue may be excessive.”&#xD;
   Finally, the inference that Graham’s sentence is dispro&#xD;
portionate is further validated by comparison to the sen&#xD;
tences imposed in other domestic jurisdictions. As the&#xD;
majority opinion explains, Florida is an outlier in its will&#xD;
ingness to impose sentences of life without parole on juve&#xD;
niles convicted of nonhomicide crimes. See ante, at 11–13.&#xD;
                              III&#xD;
  So much for Graham. But what about Milagro Cun&#xD;
ningham, a 17-year-old who beat and raped an 8-year-old&#xD;
girl before leaving her to die under 197 pounds of rock in a&#xD;
recycling bin in a remote landfill? See Musgrave, Cruel or&#xD;
Necessary? Life Terms for Youths Spur National Debate,&#xD;
Palm Beach Post, Oct. 15, 2009, p. 1A. Or Nathan Walker&#xD;
and Jakaris Taylor, the Florida juveniles who together&#xD;
with their friends gang-raped a woman and forced her to&#xD;
perform oral sex on her 12-year-old son? See 3 Sentenced&#xD;
to Life for Gang Rape of Mother, Associated Press, Oct. 14,&#xD;
2009. The fact that Graham cannot be sentenced to life&#xD;
without parole for his conduct says nothing whatever&#xD;
about these offenders, or others like them who commit&#xD;
nonhomicide crimes far more reprehensible than the&#xD;
conduct at issue here. The Court uses Graham’s case as a&#xD;
vehicle to proclaim a new constitutional rule—applicable&#xD;
well beyond the particular facts of Graham’s case—that a&#xD;
10                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&#xD;
&#xD;
              ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
sentence of life without parole imposed on any juvenile for&#xD;
any nonhomicide offense is unconstitutional. This cate&#xD;
gorical conclusion is as unnecessary as it is unwise.&#xD;
   A holding this broad is unnecessary because the particu&#xD;
lar conduct and circumstances at issue in the case before&#xD;
us are not serious enough to justify Graham’s sentence.&#xD;
In reaching this conclusion, there is no need for the Court&#xD;
to decide whether that same sentence would be constitu&#xD;
tional if imposed for other more heinous nonhomicide&#xD;
crimes.&#xD;
   A more restrained approach is especially appropriate in&#xD;
light of the Court’s apparent recognition that it is perfectly&#xD;
legitimate for a juvenile to receive a sentence of life with&#xD;
out parole for committing murder. This means that there&#xD;
is nothing inherently unconstitutional about imposing&#xD;
sentences of life without parole on juvenile offenders;&#xD;
rather, the constitutionality of such sentences depends on&#xD;
the particular crimes for which they are imposed. But if&#xD;
the constitutionality of the sentence turns on the particu&#xD;
lar crime being punished, then the Court should limit its&#xD;
holding to the particular offenses that Graham committed&#xD;
here, and should decline to consider other hypothetical&#xD;
crimes not presented by this case.&#xD;
   In any event, the Court’s categorical conclusion is also&#xD;
unwise. Most importantly, it ignores the fact that some&#xD;
nonhomicide crimes—like the ones committed by Milagro&#xD;
Cunningham, Nathan Walker, and Jakaris Taylor—are&#xD;
especially heinous or grotesque, and thus may be deserv&#xD;
ing of more severe punishment.&#xD;
   Those under 18 years old may as a general matter have&#xD;
“diminished” culpability relative to adults who commit the&#xD;
same crimes, Roper, 543 U. S., at 571, but that does not&#xD;
mean that their culpability is always insufficient to justify&#xD;
a life sentence. See generally Thompson, 487 U. S., at 853&#xD;
(O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment). It does not take a&#xD;
moral sense that is fully developed in every respect to&#xD;

&#xD;
             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
know that beating and raping an 8-year-old girl and leav&#xD;
ing her to die under 197 pounds of rocks is horribly wrong.&#xD;
The single fact of being 17 years old would not afford&#xD;
Cunningham protection against life without parole if the&#xD;
young girl had died—as Cunningham surely expected she&#xD;
would—so why should it do so when she miraculously&#xD;
survived his barbaric brutality?&#xD;
   The Court defends its categorical approach on the&#xD;
grounds that a “clear line is necessary to prevent the&#xD;
possibility that life without parole sentences will be im&#xD;
posed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders who are not&#xD;
sufficiently culpable to merit that punishment.” Ante, at&#xD;
24. It argues that a case-by-case approach to proportional&#xD;
ity review is constitutionally insufficient because courts&#xD;
might not be able “with sufficient accuracy [to] distinguish&#xD;
the few incorrigible juvenile offenders from the many that&#xD;
have the capacity for change.” Ante, at 27.&#xD;
   The Court is of course correct that judges will never&#xD;
have perfect foresight—or perfect wisdom—in making&#xD;
sentencing decisions. But this is true when they sentence&#xD;
adults no less than when they sentence juveniles. It is&#xD;
also true when they sentence juveniles who commit mur&#xD;
der no less than when they sentence juveniles who commit&#xD;
other crimes.&#xD;
   Our system depends upon sentencing judges applying&#xD;
their reasoned judgment to each case that comes before&#xD;
them. As we explained in Solem, the whole enterprise of&#xD;
proportionality review is premised on the “justified” as&#xD;
sumption that “courts are competent to judge the gravity&#xD;
of an offense, at least on a relative scale.” 463 U. S., at&#xD;
292. Indeed, “courts traditionally have made these judg&#xD;
ments” by applying “generally accepted criteria” to analyze&#xD;
“the harm caused or threatened to the victim or society,&#xD;
and the culpability of the offender.” Id., at 292, 294.&#xD;

                         *     *   *&#xD;
   Terrance Graham committed serious offenses, for which&#xD;
he deserves serious punishment. But he was only 16 years&#xD;
old, and under our Court’s precedents, his youth is one&#xD;
factor, among others, that should be considered in decid&#xD;
ing whether his punishment was unconstitutionally exces&#xD;
sive. In my view, Graham’s age—together with the nature&#xD;
of his criminal activity and the unusual severity of his&#xD;
sentence—tips the constitutional balance. I thus concur in&#xD;
the Court’s judgment that Graham’s sentence of life with&#xD;
out parole violated the Eighth Amendment.&#xD;
   I would not, however, reach the same conclusion in&#xD;
every case involving a juvenile offender. Some crimes are&#xD;
so heinous, and some juvenile offenders so highly culpable,&#xD;
that a sentence of life without parole may be entirely&#xD;
justified under the Constitution. As we have said, “suc&#xD;
cessful challenges” to noncapital sentences under the&#xD;
Eighth Amendment have been—and, in my view, should&#xD;
continue to be—“exceedingly rare.” Rummel, 445 U. S., at&#xD;
272. But Graham’s sentence presents the exceptional case&#xD;
that our precedents have recognized will come along. We&#xD;
should grant Graham the relief to which he is entitled&#xD;
under the Eighth Amendment. The Court errs, however,&#xD;
in using this case as a vehicle for unsettling our estab&#xD;
lished jurisprudence and fashioning a categorical rule&#xD;
applicable to far different cases.&#xD;

    TERRANCE JAMAR GRAHAM, PETITIONER v.&#xD;
&#xD;
                 FLORIDA &#xD;
&#xD;
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL&#xD;
              OF FLORIDA, FIRST DISTRICT&#xD;
              [May 17, 2010; modified July 6, 2010]&#xD;
&#xD;
   JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins, and&#xD;
with whom JUSTICE ALITO joins as to Parts I and III,&#xD;
dissenting.&#xD;
   The Court holds today that it is “grossly disproportion&#xD;
ate” and hence unconstitutional for any judge or jury to&#xD;
impose a sentence of life without parole on an offender less&#xD;
than 18 years old, unless he has committed a homicide.&#xD;
Although the text of the Constitution is silent regarding&#xD;
the permissibility of this sentencing practice, and al&#xD;
though it would not have offended the standards that&#xD;
prevailed at the founding, the Court insists that the stan&#xD;
dards of American society have evolved such that the&#xD;
Constitution now requires its prohibition.&#xD;
   The news of this evolution will, I think, come as a sur&#xD;
prise to the American people. Congress, the District of&#xD;
Columbia, and 37 States allow judges and juries to con&#xD;
sider this sentencing practice in juvenile nonhomicide&#xD;
cases, and those judges and juries have decided to use it in&#xD;
the very worst cases they have encountered.&#xD;
   The Court does not conclude that life without parole&#xD;
itself is a cruel and unusual punishment. It instead re&#xD;
jects the judgments of those legislatures, judges, and&#xD;
juries regarding what the Court describes as the “moral”&#xD;
question of whether this sentence can ever be “propor&#xD;
tionat[e]” when applied to the category of offenders at&#xD;

issue here. Ante, at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted),&#xD;
ante, at 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring).&#xD;
  I am unwilling to assume that we, as members of this&#xD;
Court, are any more capable of making such moral judg&#xD;
ments than our fellow citizens. Nothing in our training as&#xD;
judges qualifies us for that task, and nothing in Article III&#xD;
gives us that authority.&#xD;
  I respectfully dissent.&#xD;
                              I&#xD;
   The Court recounts the facts of Terrance Jamar Gra&#xD;
ham’s case in detail, so only a summary is necessary here.&#xD;
At age 16 years and 6 months, Graham and two masked&#xD;
accomplices committed a burglary at a small Florida&#xD;
restaurant, during which one of Graham’s accomplices&#xD;
twice struck the restaurant manager on the head with a&#xD;
steel pipe when he refused to turn over money to the&#xD;
intruders. Graham was arrested and charged as an adult.&#xD;
He later pleaded guilty to two offenses, including armed&#xD;
burglary with assault or battery, an offense punishable by&#xD;
life imprisonment under Florida law.           Fla. Stat.&#xD;
§§810.02(2)(a), 810.02(2)(b) (2007). The trial court with&#xD;
held adjudication on both counts, however, and sentenced&#xD;
Graham to probation, the first 12 months of which he&#xD;
spent in a county detention facility.&#xD;
   Graham reoffended just six months after his release. At&#xD;
a probation revocation hearing, a judge found by a pre&#xD;
ponderance of the evidence that, at age 17 years and 11&#xD;
months, Graham invaded a home with two accomplices&#xD;
and held the homeowner at gunpoint for approximately 30&#xD;
minutes while his accomplices ransacked the residence.&#xD;
As a result, the judge concluded that Graham had violated&#xD;
his probation and, after additional hearings, adjudicated&#xD;
Graham guilty on both counts arising from the restaurant&#xD;
robbery. The judge imposed the maximum sentence al&#xD;
lowed by Florida law on the armed burglary count, life&#xD;

&#xD;
imprisonment without the possibility of parole.&#xD;
  Graham argues, and the Court holds, that this sentence&#xD;
violates the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual&#xD;
Punishments Clause because a life-without-parole sen&#xD;
tence is always “grossly disproportionate” when imposed&#xD;
on a person under 18 who commits any crime short of a&#xD;
homicide. Brief for Petitioner 24; ante, at 21.&#xD;

&#xD;
                             A&#xD;
&#xD;
    The Eighth Amendment, which applies to the States&#xD;
through the Fourteenth, provides that “[e]xcessive bail&#xD;
shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor&#xD;
cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.” It is by now&#xD;
well established that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments&#xD;
Clause was originally understood as prohibiting torturous&#xD;
“ ‘methods of punishment,’ ” Harmelin v. Michigan, 501&#xD;
U. S. 957, 979 (1991) (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (quoting&#xD;
Granucci, “Nor Cruel and Unusual Punishments In&#xD;
flicted”: The Original Meaning, 57 Cal. L. Rev. 839, 842&#xD;
(1969))—specifically methods akin to those that had been&#xD;
considered cruel and unusual at the time the Bill of&#xD;
Rights was adopted, Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, 99 (2008)&#xD;
(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). With one arguable&#xD;
exception, see Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349&#xD;
(1910); Harmelin, supra, at 990–994 (opinion of&#xD;
SCALIA, J.) (discussing the scope and relevance of Weems’&#xD;
holding), this Court applied the Clause with that under&#xD;
standing for nearly 170 years after the Eighth Amend&#xD;
ment’s ratification.&#xD;
   More recently, however, the Court has held that the&#xD;
Clause authorizes it to proscribe not only methods of&#xD;
punishment that qualify as “cruel and unusual,” but also&#xD;
any punishment that the Court deems “grossly dispropor&#xD;
tionate” to the crime committed. Ante, at 8 (internal&#xD;
quotation marks omitted). This latter interpretation is&#xD;

&#xD;
entirely the Court’s creation. As has been described else&#xD;
where at length, there is virtually no indication that the&#xD;
Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause originally was&#xD;
understood to require proportionality in sentencing. See&#xD;
Harmelin, 501 U. S., at 975–985 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).&#xD;
Here, it suffices to recall just two points. First, the Clause&#xD;
does not expressly refer to proportionality or invoke any&#xD;
synonym for that term, even though the Framers were&#xD;
familiar with the concept, as evidenced by several found&#xD;
ing-era state constitutions that required (albeit without&#xD;
defining) proportional punishments. See id., at 977–978.&#xD;
In addition, the penal statute adopted by the First Con&#xD;
gress demonstrates that proportionality in sentencing was&#xD;
not considered a constitutional command.1 See id., at&#xD;
980–981 (noting that the statute prescribed capital pun&#xD;
ishment for offenses ranging from “ ‘run[ning] away with&#xD;
. . . goods or merchandise to the value of fifty dollars,’ ” to&#xD;
“murder on the high seas” (quoting 1 Stat. 114)); see also&#xD;

  1 THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s concurrence suggests that it is unnecessary to&#xD;
&#xD;
remark on the underlying question whether the Eighth Amendment&#xD;
requires proportionality in sentencing because “[n]either party here&#xD;
asks us to reexamine our precedents” requiring “proportionality be&#xD;
tween noncapital offenses and their corresponding punishments.” Ante,&#xD;
at 2 (opinion concurring in judgment). I disagree. Both the Court and&#xD;
the concurrence do more than apply existing noncapital proportionality&#xD;
precedents to the particulars of Graham’s claim. The Court radically&#xD;
departs from the framework those precedents establish by applying to a&#xD;
noncapital sentence the categorical proportionality review its prior&#xD;
decisions have reserved for death penalty cases alone. See Part III,&#xD;
infra. The concurrence, meanwhile, breathes new life into the case-by&#xD;
case proportionality approach that previously governed noncapital&#xD;
cases, from which the Court has steadily, and wisely, retreated since&#xD;
Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277 (1983). See Part IV, infra. In dissenting&#xD;
from both choices to expand proportionality review, I find it essential to&#xD;
reexamine the foundations on which that doctrine is built.&#xD;

generally were punished either by fines, whipping, or&#xD;
public “shaming,” or by death, as intermediate sentencing&#xD;
options such as incarceration were not common).&#xD;
   The Court has nonetheless invoked proportionality to&#xD;
declare that capital punishment—though not unconstitu&#xD;
tional per se—is categorically too harsh a penalty to apply&#xD;
to certain types of crimes and certain classes of offenders.&#xD;
See Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977) (plurality opin&#xD;
ion) (rape of an adult woman); Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554&#xD;
U. S. ___ (2008) (rape of a child); Enmund v. Florida, 458&#xD;
U. S. 782 (1982) (felony murder in which the defendant&#xD;
participated in the felony but did not kill or intend to kill);&#xD;
Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815 (1988) (plurality&#xD;
opinion) (juveniles under 16); Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S.&#xD;
551 (2005) (juveniles under 18); Atkins v. Virginia, 536&#xD;
U. S. 304 (2002) (mentally retarded offenders). In adopting&#xD;
these categorical proportionality rules, the Court intrudes&#xD;
upon areas that the Constitution reserves to other (state&#xD;
and federal) organs of government. The Eighth Amend&#xD;
ment prohibits the government from inflicting a cruel and&#xD;
unusual method of punishment upon a defendant. Other&#xD;
constitutional provisions ensure the defendant’s right to&#xD;
fair process before any punishment is imposed. But, as&#xD;
members of today’s majority note, “[s]ociety changes,” ante,&#xD;
at 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring), and the Eighth Amendment&#xD;
leaves the unavoidably moral question of who “deserves” a&#xD;
particular nonprohibited method of punishment to the&#xD;
judgment of the legislatures that authorize the penalty, the&#xD;
prosecutors who seek it, and the judges and juries that&#xD;
impose it under circumstances they deem appropriate.&#xD;
   The Court has nonetheless adopted categorical rules&#xD;
that shield entire classes of offenses and offenders from&#xD;
the death penalty on the theory that “evolving standards&#xD;
of decency” require this result. Ante, at 7 (internal quota&#xD;
tion marks omitted). The Court has offered assurances&#xD;
that these standards can be reliably measured by “ ‘objec&#xD;

&#xD;
                     THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
tive indicia’ ” of “national consensus,” such as state and&#xD;
federal legislation, jury behavior, and (surprisingly, given&#xD;
that we are talking about “national” consensus) interna&#xD;
tional opinion. Ante, at 10 (quoting Roper, supra, at 563);&#xD;
see also ante, at 10–16, 29–31. Yet even assuming that is&#xD;
true, the Framers did not provide for the constitutionality&#xD;
of a particular type of punishment to turn on a “snapshot&#xD;
of American public opinion” taken at the moment a case&#xD;
is decided. Roper, supra, at 629 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).&#xD;
By holding otherwise, the Court pretermits in all but one&#xD;
direction the evolution of the standards it describes, thus&#xD;
“calling a constitutional halt to what may well be a pen&#xD;
dulum swing in social attitudes,” Thompson, supra, at&#xD;
869 (SCALIA, J., dissenting), and “stunt[ing] legislative&#xD;
consideration” of new questions of penal policy as they&#xD;
emerge, Kennedy, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 2) (ALITO, J.,&#xD;
dissenting).&#xD;
   But the Court is not content to rely on snapshots of&#xD;
community consensus in any event. Ante, at 16 (“Commu&#xD;
nity consensus, while ‘entitled to great weight,’ is not itself&#xD;
determinative” (quoting Kennedy, supra, at __ (slip op., at&#xD;
24))). Instead, it reserves the right to reject the evidence&#xD;
of consensus it finds whenever its own “independent judg&#xD;
ment” points in a different direction. Ante, at 16. The&#xD;
Court thus openly claims the power not only to approve or&#xD;
disapprove of democratic choices in penal policy based on&#xD;
evidence of how society’s standards have evolved, but also&#xD;
on the basis of the Court’s “independent” perception of&#xD;
how those standards should evolve, which depends on&#xD;
what the Court concedes is “ ‘ “necessarily . . . a moral&#xD;
judgment” ’ ” regarding the propriety of a given punish&#xD;
ment in today’s society. Ante, at 7 (quoting Kennedy,&#xD;
supra, at ___ (slip op., at 8)).&#xD;
   The categorical proportionality review the Court em&#xD;
ploys in capital cases thus lacks a principled foundation.&#xD;
The Court’s decision today is significant because it does&#xD;

&#xD;
                    THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
not merely apply this standard—it remarkably expands its&#xD;
reach. For the first time in its history, the Court declares&#xD;
an entire class of offenders immune from a noncapital&#xD;
sentence using the categorical approach it previously&#xD;
reserved for death penalty cases alone.&#xD;
                                B&#xD;
   Until today, the Court has based its categorical propor&#xD;
tionality rulings on the notion that the Constitution gives&#xD;
special protection to capital defendants because the death&#xD;
penalty is a uniquely severe punishment that must be&#xD;
reserved for only those who are “most deserving of execu&#xD;
tion.” Atkins, supra, at 319; see Roper, supra, at 568;&#xD;
Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982); Lockett v.&#xD;
Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978).           Of course, the Eighth&#xD;
Amendment itself makes no distinction between capital&#xD;
and noncapital sentencing, but the “ ‘bright line’ ” the&#xD;
Court drew between the two penalties has for many years&#xD;
served as the principal justification for the Court’s will&#xD;
ingness to reject democratic choices regarding the death&#xD;
penalty. See Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, 275 (1980).&#xD;
   Today’s decision eviscerates that distinction. “Death is&#xD;
different” no longer. The Court now claims not only the&#xD;
power categorically to reserve the “most severe punish&#xD;
ment” for those the Court thinks are “ ‘the most deserving&#xD;
of execution,’ ” Roper, 543 U. S., at 568 (quoting Atkins,&#xD;
536 U. S., at 319), but also to declare that “less culpable”&#xD;
persons are categorically exempt from the “second most&#xD;
severe penalty.” Ante, at 21 (emphasis added). No reli&#xD;
able limiting principle remains to prevent the Court from&#xD;
immunizing any class of offenders from the law’s third,&#xD;
fourth, fifth, or fiftieth most severe penalties as well.&#xD;
   The Court’s departure from the “death is different”&#xD;
distinction is especially mystifying when one considers&#xD;
how long it has resisted crossing that divide. Indeed, for a&#xD;
time the Court declined to apply proportionality principles&#xD;
8                   GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&#xD;
&#xD;
                    THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
to noncapital sentences at all, emphasizing that “a sen&#xD;
tence of death differs in kind from any sentence of impris&#xD;
onment, no matter how long.” Rummel, 445 U. S., at 272&#xD;
(emphasis added). Based on that rationale, the Court&#xD;
found that the excessiveness of one prison term as com&#xD;
pared to another was “properly within the province of&#xD;
legislatures, not courts,” id., at 275–276, precisely because&#xD;
it involved an “invariably . . . subjective determination,&#xD;
there being no clear way to make ‘any constitutional dis&#xD;
tinction between one term of years and a shorter or longer&#xD;
term of years,’ ” Hutto v. Davis, 454 U. S. 370, 373 (1982)&#xD;
(per curiam) (quoting Rummel, supra, at 275; emphasis&#xD;
added).&#xD;
   Even when the Court broke from that understanding in&#xD;
its 5-to-4 decision in Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277 (1983)&#xD;
(striking down as “grossly disproportionate” a life-without&#xD;
parole sentence imposed on a defendant for passing a&#xD;
worthless check), the Court did so only as applied to the&#xD;
facts of that case; it announced no categorical rule. Id., at&#xD;
288, 303. Moreover, the Court soon cabined Solem’s ra&#xD;
tionale. The controlling opinion in the Court’s very next&#xD;
noncapital proportionality case emphasized that principles&#xD;
of federalism require substantial deference to legislative&#xD;
choices regarding the proper length of prison sentences.&#xD;
Harmelin, 501 U. S., at 999 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.)&#xD;
(“[M]arked divergences both in underlying theories of&#xD;
sentencing and in the length of prescribed prison terms&#xD;
are the inevitable, often beneficial, result of the federal&#xD;
structure”); id., at 1000 (“[D]iffering attitudes and percep&#xD;
tions of local conditions may yield different, yet rational,&#xD;
conclusions regarding the appropriate length of prison&#xD;
terms for particular crimes”). That opinion thus concluded&#xD;
that “successful challenges to the proportionality of&#xD;
[prison] sentences [would be] exceedingly rare.” Id., at&#xD;
1001 (internal quotation marks omitted).&#xD;
   They have been rare indeed. In the 28 years since&#xD;

&#xD;
Solem, the Court has considered just three such chal&#xD;
lenges and has rejected them all, see Ewing v. California,&#xD;
538 U. S. 11 (2003); Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63&#xD;
(2003); Harmelin, supra, largely on the theory that criti&#xD;
cisms of the “wisdom, cost-efficiency, and effectiveness” of&#xD;
term-of-years prison sentences are “appropriately directed&#xD;
at the legislature[s],” not the courts, Ewing, supra, at 27,&#xD;
28 (plurality opinion). The Court correctly notes that&#xD;
those decisions were “closely divided,” ante, at 8, but so&#xD;
was Solem itself, and it is now fair to describe Solem as an&#xD;
outlier.2&#xD;
   Remarkably, the Court today does more than return to&#xD;
Solem’s case-by-case proportionality standard for noncapi&#xD;
tal sentences; it hurtles past it to impose a categorical&#xD;
proportionality rule banning life-without-parole sentences&#xD;
not just in this case, but in every case involving a juvenile&#xD;
nonhomicide offender, no matter what the circumstances.&#xD;
Neither the Eighth Amendment nor the Court’s prece&#xD;
dents justify this decision.&#xD;
                            III&#xD;

view is necessary here merely because Graham asks for a&#xD;

  2 Courts  and commentators interpreting this Court’s decisions have&#xD;
reached this conclusion. See, e.g., United States v. Polk, 546 F. 3d 74,&#xD;
76 (CA1 2008) (“[I]nstances of gross disproportionality [in noncapital&#xD;
cases] will be hen’s-teeth rare”); Barkow, The Court of Life and Death:&#xD;

&#xD;
                         THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
thinks clear lines are a good idea, see ante, at 25. I find&#xD;
those factors wholly insufficient to justify the Court’s&#xD;
break from past practice. First, the Court fails to ac&#xD;
knowledge that a petitioner seeking to exempt an entire&#xD;
category of offenders from a sentencing practice carries a&#xD;
much heavier burden than one seeking case-specific relief&#xD;
under Solem. Unlike the petitioner in Solem, Graham&#xD;
must establish not only that his own life-without-parole&#xD;
sentence is “grossly disproportionate,” but also that such a&#xD;
sentence is always grossly disproportionate whenever it is&#xD;
applied to a juvenile nonhomicide offender, no matter how&#xD;
heinous his crime. Cf. United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S.&#xD;
739 (1987). Second, even applying the Court’s categorical&#xD;
“evolving standards” test, neither objective evidence of&#xD;
national consensus nor the notions of culpability on which&#xD;
the Court’s “independent judgment” relies can justify the&#xD;
categorical rule it declares here.&#xD;
                              A&#xD;
  According to the Court, proper Eighth Amendment&#xD;
analysis “begins with objective indicia of national consen&#xD;
sus,”3 and “[t]he clearest and most reliable objective evi&#xD;
dence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted by&#xD;
the country’s legislatures,” ante, at 10–11 (internal quota&#xD;

  3 The Court ignores entirely the threshold inquiry of whether subject&#xD;
&#xD;
ing juvenile offenders to adult penalties was one of the “modes or acts of&#xD;
punishment that had been considered cruel and unusual at the time&#xD;
that the Bill of Rights was adopted.” Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S.&#xD;
399, 405 (1986). As the Court has noted in the past, however, the&#xD;
evidence is clear that, at the time of the Founding, “the common law set&#xD;
a rebuttable presumption of incapacity to commit any felony at the age&#xD;
of 14, and theoretically permitted [even] capital punishment to be&#xD;
imposed on a person as young as age 7.” Stanford v. Kentucky, 492&#xD;
U. S. 361, 368 (1989) (citing 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *23–*24; 1&#xD;
M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 24–29 (1800)). It thus seems exceedingly&#xD;
unlikely that the imposition of a life-without-parole sentence on a&#xD;
person of Graham’s age would run afoul of those standards.&#xD;

tion marks omitted). As such, the analysis should end&#xD;
quickly, because a national “consensus” in favor of the&#xD;
Court’s result simply does not exist. The laws of all 50&#xD;
States, the Federal Government, and the District of Co&#xD;
lumbia provide that juveniles over a certain age may be&#xD;
tried in adult court if charged with certain crimes.4 See&#xD;
ante, at 33–35 (Appendix to opinion of the Court). Forty&#xD;
five States, the Federal Government, and the District of&#xD;
Columbia expose juvenile offenders charged in adult court&#xD;
to the very same range of punishments faced by adults&#xD;
charged with the same crimes. See ante, at 33–34, Part I.&#xD;
Eight of those States do not make life-without-parole&#xD;
sentences available for any nonhomicide offender, regard&#xD;
less of age.5 All remaining jurisdictions—the Federal&#xD;
Government, the other 37 States, and the District—&#xD;
authorize life-without-parole sentences for certain non&#xD;
homicide offenses, and authorize the imposition of such&#xD;
sentences on persons under 18. See ibid. Only five States&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  4 Although  the details of state laws vary extensively, they generally&#xD;
permit the transfer of a juvenile offender to adult court through one or&#xD;
more of the following mechanisms: (1) judicial waiver, in which the&#xD;
juvenile court has the authority to waive jurisdiction over the offender&#xD;
and transfer the case to adult court; (2) concurrent jurisdiction, in&#xD;
which adult and juvenile courts share jurisdiction over certain cases&#xD;
and the prosecutor has discretion to file in either court; or (3) statutory&#xD;
provisions that exclude juveniles who commit certain crimes from&#xD;
juvenile-court jurisdiction. See Dept. of Justice, Juvenile Offenders and&#xD;
Victims: 1999 National Report 89, 104 (1999) (hereinafter 1999 DOJ&#xD;

prohibit juvenile offenders from receiving a life-without&#xD;
parole sentence that could be imposed on an adult con&#xD;
victed of the same crime.6&#xD;
    No plausible claim of a consensus against this sentenc&#xD;
ing practice can be made in light of this overwhelming&#xD;
legislative evidence. The sole fact that federal law author&#xD;
izes this practice singlehandedly refutes the claim that our&#xD;
Nation finds it morally repugnant. The additional reality&#xD;
that 37 out of 50 States (a supermajority of 74%) permit&#xD;
the practice makes the claim utterly implausible. Not only&#xD;
is there no consensus against this penalty, there is a clear&#xD;
legislative consensus in favor of its availability.&#xD;
    Undaunted, however, the Court brushes this evidence&#xD;
aside as “incomplete and unavailing,” declaring that&#xD;
“ ‘[t]here are measures of consensus other than legisla&#xD;
tion.’ ” Ante, at 11 (quoting Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip&#xD;
op., at 22)). This is nothing short of stunning. Most im&#xD;
portantly, federal civilian law approves this sentencing&#xD;
practice.7 And although the Court has never decided how&#xD;
many state laws are necessary to show consensus, the&#xD;
Court has never banished into constitutional exile a sen&#xD;
tencing practice that the laws of a majority, let alone a&#xD;
supermajority, of States expressly permit.8&#xD;

  Moreover, the consistency and direction of recent legis&#xD;

crafting categorical proportionality rules, see Atkins, 536&#xD;
U. S., at 315–316; Roper, 543 U. S., at 565–566—&#xD;
underscores the consensus against the rule the Court&#xD;
announces here. In my view, the Court cannot point to a&#xD;
national consensus in favor of its rule without assuming a&#xD;
consensus in favor of the two penological points it later&#xD;
discusses: (1) Juveniles are always less culpable than&#xD;
similarly-situated adults, and (2) juveniles who commit&#xD;
nonhomicide crimes should always receive an opportunity&#xD;
to demonstrate rehabilitation through parole. Ante, at 17–&#xD;
18, 23–25. But legislative trends make that assumption&#xD;
untenable.&#xD;
  First, States over the past 20 years have consistently&#xD;
increased the severity of punishments for juvenile offend&#xD;
ers. See 1999 DOJ National Report 89 (referring to the&#xD;
1990’s as “a time of unprecedented change as State legis&#xD;

punishment for the rape of a child where only six States had enacted&#xD;
statutes authorizing the punishment since Furman v. Georgia, 408&#xD;

568 (2005) (prohibiting capital punishment for offenders younger than&#xD;
18 where 18 of 38 death-penalty States precluded imposition of the&#xD;
penalty on persons under 18 and the remaining 12 States did not&#xD;
permit capital punishment at all); Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304,&#xD;
314–315 (2002) (prohibiting capital punishment of mentally retarded&#xD;

latures crack[ed] down on juvenile crime”); ibid. (noting&#xD;
that, during that period, “legislatures in 47 States and the&#xD;
District of Columbia enacted laws that made their juvenile&#xD;
justice systems more punitive,” principally by “ma[king] it&#xD;
easier to transfer juvenile offenders from the juvenile&#xD;
justice system to the [adult] criminal justice system”); id.,&#xD;
at 104. This, in my view, reveals the States’ widespread&#xD;
agreement that juveniles can sometimes act with the same&#xD;
culpability as adults and that the law should permit&#xD;
judges and juries to consider adult sentences—including&#xD;
life without parole—in those rare and unfortunate cases.&#xD;
See Feld, Unmitigated Punishment: Adolescent Criminal&#xD;
Responsibility and LWOP Sentences, 10 J. Law &amp; Family&#xD;
Studies 11, 69–70 (2007) (noting that life-without-parole&#xD;

of Their Lives: Life Without Parole for Child Offenders in&#xD;
the United States 2, 31 (2005) (same).&#xD;
   Second, legislatures have moved away from parole over&#xD;
the same period. Congress abolished parole for federal&#xD;
offenders in 1984 amid criticism that it was subject to&#xD;
“gamesmanship and cynicism,” Breyer, Federal Sentenc&#xD;
ing Guidelines Revisited, 11 Fed. Sentencing Rep. 180&#xD;
(1999) (discussing the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98&#xD;

Hughes, D. Wilson, &amp; A. Beck, Dept. of Justice, Bureau of&#xD;
Justice Statistics, Trends in State Parole, 1990–2000, p. 1&#xD;
(2001) (noting that, by the end of 2000, 16 States had&#xD;
abolished parole for all offenses, while another 4 States&#xD;
had abolished it for certain ones). In light of these devel&#xD;
opments, the argument that there is nationwide consensus&#xD;
that parole must be available to offenders less than 18&#xD;
years old in every nonhomicide case simply fails.&#xD;
                            B&#xD;
     The Court nonetheless dismisses existing legislation,&#xD;

use, the Court proclaims a consensus against the practice,&#xD;
implying that laws allowing it either reflect the consensus&#xD;
of a prior, less civilized time or are the work of legislatures&#xD;
tone-deaf to moral values of their constituents that this&#xD;
Court claims to have easily discerned from afar. See ante,&#xD;

   This logic strains credulity. It has been rejected before.&#xD;

——————&#xD;
   9 I say “recent memory” because the research relied upon by the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
provides a headcount of juvenile nonhomicide offenders presently&#xD;
incarcerated in this country, but does not provide more specific infor&#xD;
mation about all of the offenders, such as the dates on which they were&#xD;
convicted.&#xD;
   10 When issued, the Court’s opinion relied on a letter the Court had&#xD;
&#xD;
requested from the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), which stated that there&#xD;
were six juvenile nonhomicide offenders then serving life-without&#xD;
parole sentences in the federal system. After the Court released its&#xD;
opinion, the Acting Solicitor General disputed the BOP’s calculations&#xD;
and stated that none of those six offenders was serving a life without&#xD;
parole sentence solely for a juvenile nonhomicide crime completed&#xD;
before the age of 18. See Letter from Neal Kumar Katyal, Acting&#xD;
Solicitor General, U. S. Dept. of Justice, to Clerk of the Supreme Court&#xD;
(May 24, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court’s case file) (noting that five&#xD;
of the six inmates were convicted for participation in unlawful con&#xD;
spiracies that began when they were juveniles but continued after they&#xD;
reached the age of 18, and noting that the sixth inmate was convicted of&#xD;
murder as a predicate offense under the Racketeer Influenced and&#xD;
Corrupt Organizations Act). The Court has amended its opinion in&#xD;
light of the Acting Solicitor General’s letter. In my view, the inconsis&#xD;
tency between the BOP’s classification of these six offenders and the&#xD;
Solicitor General’s is irrelevant. The fact remains that federal law, and&#xD;
the laws of a supermajority of States, permit this sentencing practice.&#xD;
And, as will be explained, see infra this page and 16–20, judges and&#xD;
jurors have chosen to impose this sentence in the very worst cases they&#xD;
have encountered.&#xD;

&#xD;
                     THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
infrequency of jury verdicts imposing the death sentence&#xD;
does not indicate rejection of capital punishment per se.&#xD;
Rather, [it] . . . may well reflect the humane feeling that&#xD;
this most irrevocable of sanctions should be reserved for a&#xD;
small number of extreme cases”). It should also be re&#xD;
jected here. That a punishment is rarely imposed demon&#xD;
strates nothing more than a general consensus that it&#xD;
should be just that—rarely imposed. It is not proof that&#xD;
the punishment is one the Nation abhors.&#xD;
   The Court nonetheless insists that the 26 States that&#xD;
authorize this penalty, but are not presently incarcerating&#xD;
a juvenile nonhomicide offender on a life-without-parole&#xD;
sentence, cannot be counted as approving its use. The&#xD;
mere fact that the laws of a jurisdiction permit this pen&#xD;
alty, the Court explains, “does not indicate that the pen&#xD;
alty has been endorsed through deliberate, express, and&#xD;
full legislative consideration.” Ante, at 16.&#xD;
   But this misapplies the Court’s own evolving standards&#xD;
test. Under that test, “[i]t is not the burden of [a State] to&#xD;
establish a national consensus approving what their citi&#xD;
zens have voted to do; rather, it is the ‘heavy burden’ of&#xD;
petitioners to establish a national consensus against it.”&#xD;
Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361, 373 (1989) (quoting&#xD;
Gregg, supra, at 175 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and&#xD;
STEVENS, JJ.); some emphasis added). In light of this fact,&#xD;
the Court is wrong to equate a jurisdiction’s disuse of a&#xD;
legislatively authorized penalty with its moral opposition&#xD;
to it. The fact that the laws of a jurisdiction permit this&#xD;
sentencing practice demonstrates, at a minimum, that the&#xD;
citizens of that jurisdiction find tolerable the possibility&#xD;
that a jury of their peers could impose a life-without&#xD;
parole sentence on a juvenile whose nonhomicide crime is&#xD;
sufficiently depraved.&#xD;
   The recent case of 16-year-old Keighton Budder illus&#xD;
trates this point. Just weeks before the release of this&#xD;
opinion, an Oklahoma jury sentenced Budder to life with&#xD;

pounded her face into the rocks alongside a dirt road.&#xD;

Miraculously, the victim survived. Ibid.&#xD;
   Budder’s crime was rare in its brutality. The sentence&#xD;
the jury imposed was also rare. According to the study&#xD;
relied upon by this Court, Oklahoma had no such offender&#xD;
in its prison system before Budder’s offense. P. Annino, D.&#xD;
Rasmussen, &amp; C. Rice, Juvenile Life Without Parole for&#xD;
Non-Homicide Offenses: Florida Compared to Nation 2, 14&#xD;
(Sept. 14, 2009) (Table A). Without his conviction, there&#xD;
fore, the Court would have counted Oklahoma’s citizens as&#xD;
morally opposed to life-without-parole sentences for juve&#xD;
niles nonhomicide offenders.&#xD;
   Yet Oklahoma’s experience proves the inescapable flaw&#xD;
in that reasoning: Oklahoma citizens have enacted laws&#xD;
that allow Oklahoma juries to consider life-without-parole&#xD;
sentences in juvenile nonhomicide cases. Oklahoma juries&#xD;
invoke those laws rarely—in the unusual cases that they&#xD;
find exceptionally depraved. I cannot agree with the&#xD;
Court that Oklahoma citizens should be constitutionally&#xD;
disabled from using this sentencing practice merely be&#xD;
cause they have not done so more frequently. If anything,&#xD;
the rarity of this penalty’s use underscores just how judi&#xD;
cious sentencing judges and juries across the country have&#xD;
been in invoking it.&#xD;
   This fact is entirely consistent with the Court’s intuition&#xD;
that juveniles generally are less culpable and more capable&#xD;
of growth than adults. See infra, at 21–22. Graham’s own&#xD;
18                       GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&#xD;
&#xD;
                         THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
case provides another example. Graham was statutorily&#xD;
eligible for a life-without-parole sentence after his first&#xD;
crime. But the record indicates that the trial court did not&#xD;
give such a sentence serious consideration at Graham’s&#xD;
initial plea hearing. It was only after Graham subse&#xD;
quently violated his parole by invading a home at gun&#xD;
point that the maximum sentence was imposed.&#xD;
   In sum, the Court’s calculation that 123 juvenile non&#xD;
homicide life-without-parole sentences have been imposed&#xD;
nationwide in recent memory, even if accepted, hardly&#xD;
amounts to strong evidence that the sentencing practice&#xD;
offends our common sense of decency.11&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  11 Because  existing legislation plainly suffices to refute any consensus&#xD;
against this sentencing practice, I assume the accuracy of the Court’s&#xD;
evidence regarding the frequency with which this sentence has been&#xD;
imposed. But I would be remiss if I did not mention two points about&#xD;
the Court’s figures. First, it seems odd that the Court counts only those&#xD;
juveniles sentenced to life without parole and excludes from its analysis&#xD;
all juveniles sentenced to lengthy term-of-years sentences (e.g., 70 or 80&#xD;
years’ imprisonment). It is difficult to argue that a judge or jury&#xD;
imposing such a long sentence—which effectively denies the offender&#xD;
any material opportunity for parole—would express moral outrage at a&#xD;
life-without-parole sentence.&#xD;
   Second, if objective indicia of consensus were truly important to the&#xD;
Court’s analysis, the statistical information presently available would&#xD;
be woefully inadequate to form the basis of an Eighth Amendment rule&#xD;
that can be revoked only by constitutional amendment. The only&#xD;
evidence submitted to this Court regarding the frequency of this sen&#xD;
tence’s imposition was a single study completed after this Court&#xD;
granted certiorari in this case. See P. Annino, D. Rasmussen, &amp; C.&#xD;
Rice, Juvenile Life Without Parole for Non-Homicide Offenses: Florida&#xD;
Compared to Nation 2 (Sept. 14, 2009). Although I have no reason to&#xD;
question the professionalism with which this study was conducted, the&#xD;
study itself acknowledges that it was incomplete and the first of its&#xD;
kind. See id., at 1. The Court’s questionable decision to “complete” the&#xD;
study on its own does not materially increase its reliability. For one&#xD;
thing, by finishing the study itself, the Court prohibits the parties from&#xD;
ever disputing its findings. Complicating matters further, the original&#xD;
study sometimes relied on third-party data rather than data from the&#xD;
States themselves, see ibid.; the study has never been peer reviewed;&#xD;

&#xD;
                         THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
   Finally, I cannot help but note that the statistics the&#xD;
Court finds inadequate to justify the penalty in this case&#xD;
are stronger than those supporting at least one other&#xD;
penalty this Court has upheld. Not long ago, this Court,&#xD;
joined by the author of today’s opinion, upheld the applica&#xD;
tion of the death penalty against a 16-year-old, despite the&#xD;
fact that no such punishment had been carried out on a&#xD;
person of that age in this country in nearly 30 years. See&#xD;
Stanford, 492 U. S., at 374. Whatever the statistical&#xD;
frequency with which life-without-parole sentences have&#xD;
been imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders in the&#xD;
last 30 years, it is surely greater than zero.&#xD;
   In the end, however, objective factors such as legislation&#xD;
and the frequency of a penalty’s use are merely ornaments&#xD;
in the Court’s analysis, window dressing that accompanies&#xD;
its judicial fiat.12 By the Court’s own decree, “[c]ommunity&#xD;
——————&#xD;
and specific data on all 123 offenders (age, date of conviction, crime of&#xD;
conviction, etc.), have not been collected, making verification of the&#xD;
Court’s headcount impossible. The Court inexplicably blames Florida&#xD;
for all of this. See ante, at 12. But as already noted, it is not Florida’s&#xD;
burden to collect data to prove a national consensus in favor of this&#xD;
sentencing practice, but Graham’s “heavy burden” to prove a consensus&#xD;
against it. See supra, at 16.&#xD;
  12 I confine to a footnote the Court’s discussion of foreign laws and&#xD;
&#xD;
sentencing practices because past opinions explain at length why such&#xD;
factors are irrelevant to the meaning of our Constitution or the Court’s&#xD;
discernment of any longstanding tradition in this Nation. See Atkins,&#xD;
536 U. S., at 324–325 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting). Here, two points&#xD;
suffice. First, despite the Court’s attempt to count the actual number of&#xD;
juvenile nonhomicide offenders serving life-without-parole sentences in&#xD;
other nations (a task even more challenging than counting them within&#xD;
our borders), the laws of other countries permit juvenile life-without&#xD;
parole sentences, see Child Rights Information, Network, C. de la Vega,&#xD;
M. Montesano, &amp; A. Solter, Human Rights Advocates, Statement on&#xD;
Juvenile Sentencing to Human Rights Council, 10th Sess. (Nov. 3,&#xD;
2009) (“Eleven countries have laws with the potential to permit the&#xD;
sentencing of child offenders to life without the possibility of release,”&#xD;
online at http://www.crin.org/resources/infoDetail.asp?ID=19806) (as&#xD;
visited May 14, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file)).&#xD;

&#xD;
                         THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
consensus . . . is not itself determinative.” Ante, at 16.&#xD;
Only the independent moral judgment of this Court is&#xD;
sufficient to decide the question. See ibid.&#xD;
                              C&#xD;
  Lacking any plausible claim to consensus, the Court&#xD;
shifts to the heart of its argument: its “independent judg&#xD;
ment” that this sentencing practice does not “serv[e] legiti&#xD;
mate penological goals.” Ante, at 16–17. The Court begins&#xD;
that analysis with the obligatory preamble that “ ‘[t]he&#xD;
Eighth Amendment does not mandate adoption of any one&#xD;
penological theory,’ ” ante, at 20 (quoting Harmelin, 501&#xD;
U. S., at 999 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.)), then promptly&#xD;
mandates the adoption of the theories the Court deems&#xD;
best.&#xD;
  First, the Court acknowledges that, at a minimum, the&#xD;
imposition of life-without-parole sentences on juvenile&#xD;
nonhomicide offenders serves two “legitimate” penological&#xD;
goals: incapacitation and deterrence. Ante, at 21–23. By&#xD;
definition, such sentences serve the goal of incapacitation&#xD;
by ensuring that juvenile offenders who commit armed&#xD;
burglaries, or those who commit the types of grievous sex&#xD;
crimes described by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, no longer&#xD;
threaten their communities. See ante, at 9 (opinion con&#xD;
curring in judgment). That should settle the matter, since&#xD;
the Court acknowledges that incapacitation is an “impor&#xD;
tant” penological goal. Ante, at 22. Yet, the Court finds&#xD;
this goal “inadequate” to justify the life-without-parole&#xD;
sentences here. Ante, at 22 (emphasis added). A similar&#xD;
fate befalls deterrence. The Court acknowledges that such&#xD;
sentences will deter future juvenile offenders, at least to&#xD;
——————&#xD;
Second, present legislation notwithstanding, democracies around the&#xD;
world remain free to adopt life-without-parole sentences for juvenile&#xD;
offenders tomorrow if they see fit. Starting today, ours can count itself&#xD;
among the few in which judicial decree prevents voters from making&#xD;
that choice.&#xD;
                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            21&#xD;
&#xD;
                     THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
some degree, but rejects that penological goal, not as&#xD;
illegitimate, but as insufficient. Ante, at 21 (“[A]ny limited&#xD;
deterrent effect provided by life without parole is not&#xD;
enough to justify the sentence.” (emphasis added)).&#xD;
   The Court looks more favorably on rehabilitation, but&#xD;
laments that life-without-parole sentences do little to&#xD;
promote this goal because they result in the offender’s&#xD;
permanent incarceration. Ante, at 23. Of course, the&#xD;
Court recognizes that rehabilitation’s “utility and proper&#xD;
implementation” are subject to debate. Ante, at 23. But&#xD;
that does not stop it from declaring that a legislature may&#xD;
not “forswea[r] . . . the rehabilitative ideal.” Ibid. In other&#xD;
words, the Eighth Amendment does not mandate “any one&#xD;
penological theory,” ante, at 20 (internal quotation marks&#xD;
omitted), just one the Court approves.&#xD;
   Ultimately, however, the Court’s “independent judg&#xD;
ment” and the proportionality rule itself center on retribu&#xD;
tion—the notion that a criminal sentence should be pro&#xD;
portioned to “ ‘the personal culpability of the criminal&#xD;
offender.’ ” Ante, at 16, 20–21 (quoting Tison v. Arizona,&#xD;
481 U. S. 137, 149 (1987)). The Court finds that retribu&#xD;
tive purposes are not served here for two reasons.&#xD;
                             1&#xD;
  First, quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 569–570, the Court&#xD;
concludes that juveniles are less culpable than adults&#xD;
because, as compared to adults, they “have a ‘ “lack of&#xD;
maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,” ’ ”&#xD;
and “their characters are ‘not as well formed.’ ” Ante, at&#xD;
17. As a general matter, this statement is entirely consis&#xD;
tent with the evidence recounted above that judges and&#xD;
juries impose the sentence at issue quite infrequently,&#xD;
despite legislative authorization to do so in many more&#xD;
cases. See Part III–B, supra. Our society tends to treat&#xD;
the average juvenile as less culpable than the average&#xD;
adult. But the question here does not involve the average&#xD;
22                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&#xD;
&#xD;
                    THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
juvenile. The question, instead, is whether the Constitu&#xD;
tion prohibits judges and juries from ever concluding that&#xD;
an offender under the age of 18 has demonstrated suffi&#xD;
cient depravity and incorrigibility to warrant his perma&#xD;
nent incarceration.&#xD;
   In holding that the Constitution imposes such a ban, the&#xD;
Court cites “developments in psychology and brain sci&#xD;
ence” indicating that juvenile minds “continue to mature&#xD;
through late adolescence,” ante, at 17 (citing Brief for&#xD;
American Medical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 16–&#xD;
24; Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as&#xD;
Amici Curiae 22–27 (hereinafter APA Brief)), and that&#xD;
juveniles are “more likely [than adults] to engage in risky&#xD;
behaviors,” id., at 7. But even if such generalizations from&#xD;
social science were relevant to constitutional rulemaking,&#xD;
the Court misstates the data on which it relies.&#xD;
   The Court equates the propensity of a fairly substantial&#xD;
number of youths to engage in “risky” or antisocial behav&#xD;
iors with the propensity of a much smaller group to com&#xD;
mit violent crimes. Ante, at 25–29. But research relied&#xD;
upon by the amici cited in the Court’s opinion differenti&#xD;
ates between adolescents for whom antisocial behavior is a&#xD;
fleeting symptom and those for whom it is a lifelong pat&#xD;
tern. See Moffitt, Adolescence-Limited and Life-Course-&#xD;
Persistent Antisocial Behavior: A Developmental Taxon&#xD;
omy, 100 Psychological Rev. 674, 678 (1993) (cited in APA&#xD;
Brief 8, 17, 20) (distinguishing between adolescents who&#xD;
are “antisocial only during adolescence” and a smaller&#xD;
group who engage in antisocial behavior “at every life&#xD;
stage” despite “drift[ing] through successive systems&#xD;
aimed at curbing their deviance”). That research further&#xD;
suggests that the pattern of behavior in the latter group&#xD;
often sets in before 18. See Moffitt, supra, at 684 (“The&#xD;
well-documented resistance of antisocial personality dis&#xD;
order to treatments of all kinds seems to suggest that the&#xD;
life-course-persistent style is fixed sometime before age&#xD;

&#xD;
                     THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
18”). And, notably, it suggests that violence itself is evi&#xD;
dence that an adolescent offender’s antisocial behavior is&#xD;
not transient. See Moffitt, A Review of Research on the&#xD;
Taxonomy of Life-Course Persistent Versus Adolescence-&#xD;
Limited Antisocial Behavior, in Taking Stock: the Status&#xD;
of Criminological Theory 277, 292–293 (F. Cullen, J.&#xD;
Wright, &amp; K. Blevins eds. 2006) (observing that “life&#xD;
course persistent” males “tended to specialize in serious&#xD;
offenses (carrying a hidden weapon, assault, robbery,&#xD;
violating court orders), whereas adolescence-limited” ones&#xD;
“specialized in non-serious offenses (theft less than $5,&#xD;
public drunkenness, giving false information on applica&#xD;
tion forms, pirating computer software, etc.)”).&#xD;
   In sum, even if it were relevant, none of this psychologi&#xD;
cal or sociological data is sufficient to support the Court’s&#xD;
“ ‘moral’ ” conclusion that youth defeats culpability in every&#xD;
case. Ante, at 18 (quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 570); see&#xD;
id., at 618 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); R. Epstein, The Case&#xD;
Against Adolescence 171 (2007) (reporting on a study of&#xD;
juvenile reasoning skills and concluding that “most teens&#xD;
are capable of conventional, adult-like moral reasoning”).&#xD;
   The Court responds that a categorical rule is nonethe&#xD;
less necessary to prevent the “ ‘unacceptable likelihood’ ”&#xD;
that a judge or jury, unduly swayed by “ ‘the brutality or&#xD;
cold-blooded nature’ ” of a juvenile’s nonhomicide crime,&#xD;
will sentence him to a life-without-parole sentence for&#xD;
which he possesses “ ‘insufficient culpability,’ ” ante, at 27&#xD;
(quoting Roper, supra, at 572–573). I find that justifica&#xD;
tion entirely insufficient. The integrity of our criminal&#xD;
justice system depends on the ability of citizens to stand&#xD;
between the defendant and an outraged public and dispas&#xD;
sionately determine his guilt and the proper amount of&#xD;
punishment based on the evidence presented. That proc&#xD;
ess necessarily admits of human error. But so does the&#xD;
process of judging in which we engage. As between the&#xD;
two, I find far more “unacceptable” that this Court,&#xD;
24                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&#xD;
&#xD;
                    THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
swayed by studies reflecting the general tendencies of&#xD;
youth, decree that the people of this country are not fit to&#xD;
decide for themselves when the rare case requires differ&#xD;
ent treatment.&#xD;
                                2&#xD;
   That is especially so because, in the end, the Court does&#xD;
not even believe its pronouncements about the juvenile&#xD;
mind. If it did, the categorical rule it announces today&#xD;
would be most peculiar because it leaves intact state and&#xD;
federal laws that permit life-without-parole sentences for&#xD;
juveniles who commit homicides. See ante, at 18–19. The&#xD;
Court thus acknowledges that there is nothing inherent in&#xD;
the psyche of a person less than 18 that prevents him from&#xD;
acquiring the moral agency necessary to warrant a life&#xD;
without-parole sentence. Instead, the Court rejects over&#xD;
whelming legislative consensus only on the question of&#xD;
which acts are sufficient to demonstrate that moral agency.&#xD;
   The Court is quite willing to accept that a 17-year-old&#xD;
who pulls the trigger on a firearm can demonstrate suffi&#xD;
cient depravity and irredeemability to be denied reentry&#xD;
into society, but insists that a 17-year-old who rapes an 8&#xD;
year-old and leaves her for dead does not. See ante, at 17–&#xD;
19; cf. ante, at 9 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment)&#xD;
(describing the crime of life-without-parole offender Mi&#xD;
lagro Cunningham). Thus, the Court’s conclusion that&#xD;
life-without-parole sentences are “grossly disproportion&#xD;
ate” for juvenile nonhomicide offenders in fact has very&#xD;
little to do with its view of juveniles, and much more to do&#xD;
with its perception that “defendants who do not kill, in&#xD;
tend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are categori&#xD;
cally less deserving of the most serious forms of punish&#xD;
ment than are murderers.” Ante, at 18.&#xD;
   That the Court is willing to impose such an exacting&#xD;
constraint on democratic sentencing choices based on such&#xD;
an untestable philosophical conclusion is remarkable. The&#xD;
                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          25&#xD;
&#xD;
                    THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
question of what acts are “deserving” of what punishments&#xD;
is bound so tightly with questions of morality and social&#xD;
conditions as to make it, almost by definition, a question&#xD;
for legislative resolution. It is true that the Court previ&#xD;
ously has relied on the notion of proportionality in holding&#xD;
certain classes of offenses categorically exempt from capi&#xD;
tal punishment. See supra, at 4. But never before today&#xD;
has the Court relied on its own view of just deserts to&#xD;
impose a categorical limit on the imposition of a lesser&#xD;
punishment. Its willingness to cross that well-established&#xD;
boundary raises the question whether any democratic&#xD;
choice regarding appropriate punishment is safe from the&#xD;
Court’s ever-expanding constitutional veto.&#xD;
                            IV&#xD;
   Although the concurrence avoids the problems associ&#xD;
ated with expanding categorical proportionality review to&#xD;
noncapital cases, it employs noncapital proportionality&#xD;
analysis in a way that raises the same fundamental&#xD;
concern. Although I do not believe Solem merits stare&#xD;
decisis treatment, Graham’s claim cannot prevail even&#xD;
under that test (as it has been limited by the Court’s&#xD;
subsequent precedents). Solem instructs a court first to&#xD;
compare the “gravity” of an offender’s conduct to the&#xD;
“harshness of the penalty” to determine whether an&#xD;
“inference” of gross disproportionality exists. 463 U. S.,&#xD;
at 290–291. Only in “the rare case” in which such an&#xD;
inference is present should the court proceed to the “ob&#xD;
jective” part of the inquiry—an intra- and interjurisdic&#xD;
tional comparison of the defendant’s sentence with others&#xD;
similarly situated. Harmelin, 501 U. S., at 1000, 1005&#xD;
(opinion of KENNEDY, J.).&#xD;
   Under the Court’s precedents, I fail to see how an “in&#xD;
ference” of gross disproportionality arises here. The con&#xD;
currence notes several arguably mitigating facts—&#xD;
Graham’s “lack of prior criminal convictions, his youth and&#xD;
26                  GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&#xD;
&#xD;
                    THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
immaturity, and the difficult circumstances of his upbring&#xD;
ing.” Ante, at 7 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment).&#xD;
But the Court previously has upheld a life-without-parole&#xD;
sentence imposed on a first-time offender who committed a&#xD;
nonviolent drug crime. See Harmelin, supra, at 1002–&#xD;
1004. Graham’s conviction for an actual violent felony is&#xD;
surely more severe than that offense. As for Graham’s&#xD;
age, it is true that Roper held juveniles categorically ineli&#xD;
gible for capital punishment, but as the concurrence ex&#xD;
plains, Roper was based on the “explicit conclusion that&#xD;
[juveniles] ‘cannot with reliability be classified among the&#xD;
worst offenders’ ”; it did “not establish that juveniles can&#xD;
never be eligible for life without parole.” Ante, at 5&#xD;
(ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment) (quoting Roper,&#xD;
543 U. S., at 569 (emphasis added in opinion of ROBERTS,&#xD;
C. J.)). In my view, Roper’s principles are thus not gener&#xD;
ally applicable outside the capital sentencing context.&#xD;
   By holding otherwise, the concurrence relies on the&#xD;
same type of subjective judgment as the Court, only it&#xD;
restrains itself to a case-by-case rather than a categorical&#xD;
ruling. The concurrence is quite ready to hand Graham&#xD;
“the general presumption of diminished culpability” for&#xD;
juveniles, ante, at 7, apparently because it believes that&#xD;
Graham’s armed burglary and home invasion crimes were&#xD;
“certainly less serious” than murder or rape, ibid. It&#xD;
recoils only from the prospect that the Court would extend&#xD;
the same presumption to a juvenile who commits a sex&#xD;
crime. See ante, at 10. I simply cannot accept that these&#xD;
subjective judgments of proportionality are ones the&#xD;
Eighth Amendment authorizes us to make.&#xD;
   The “objective” elements of the Solem test provide no&#xD;
additional support for the concurrence’s conclusion. The&#xD;
concurrence compares Graham’s sentence to “similar”&#xD;
sentences in Florida and concludes that Graham’s sen&#xD;
tence was “far more severe.” Ante, at 8 (ROBERTS, C. J,&#xD;
concurring in judgment). But strangely, the concurrence&#xD;
                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           27&#xD;
&#xD;
                     THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
uses average sentences for burglary or robbery offenses as&#xD;
examples of “similar” offenses, even though it seems that a&#xD;
run-of-the-mill burglary or robbery is not at all similar to&#xD;
Graham’s criminal history, which includes a charge for&#xD;
armed burglary with assault, and a probation violation for&#xD;
invading a home at gunpoint.&#xD;
   And even if Graham’s sentence is higher than ones he&#xD;
might have received for an armed burglary with assault in&#xD;
other jurisdictions, see ante, at 8–9, this hardly seems&#xD;
relevant if one takes seriously the principle that “ ‘[a]bsent&#xD;
a constitutionally imposed uniformity inimical to tradi&#xD;
tional notions of federalism, some State will always bear&#xD;
the distinction of treating particular offenders more se&#xD;
verely than any other State.’ ” Harmelin, supra, at 1000&#xD;
(opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (quoting Rummel, 445 U. S., at&#xD;
282; emphasis added). Applying Solem, the Court has&#xD;
upheld a 25-years-to-life sentence for theft under Califor&#xD;
nia’s recidivist statute, despite the fact that the State and&#xD;
its amici could cite only “a single instance of a similar&#xD;
sentence imposed outside the context of California’s three&#xD;
strikes law, out of a prison population [then] approaching&#xD;
two million individuals.” Ewing, 538 U. S., at 47 (BREYER,&#xD;
J., dissenting). It has also upheld a life-without-parole&#xD;
sentence for a first-time drug offender in Michigan&#xD;
charged with possessing 672 grams of cocaine despite the&#xD;
fact that only one other State would have authorized such&#xD;
a stiff penalty for a first-time drug offense, and even that&#xD;
State required a far greater quantity of cocaine (10 kilo&#xD;
grams) to trigger the penalty. See Harmelin, supra, at&#xD;
1026 (White, J., dissenting). Graham’s sentence is cer&#xD;
tainly less rare than the sentences upheld in these cases,&#xD;
so his claim fails even under Solem&#xD;
                     *     *    *&#xD;
  Both the Court and the concurrence claim their deci&#xD;
sions to be narrow ones, but both invite a host of line&#xD;
28                      GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&#xD;
&#xD;
                         THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
drawing problems to which courts must seek answers&#xD;
beyond the strictures of the Constitution. The Court holds&#xD;
that “[a] State is not required to guarantee eventual free&#xD;
dom to a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide&#xD;
crime,” but must provide the offender with “some mean&#xD;
ingful opportunity to obtain release based on demon&#xD;
strated maturity and rehabilitation.” Ante, at 24. But&#xD;
what, exactly, does such a “meaningful” opportunity en&#xD;
tail? When must it occur? And what Eighth Amendment&#xD;
principles will govern review by the parole boards the&#xD;
Court now demands that States empanel? The Court&#xD;
provides no answers to these questions, which will no&#xD;
doubt embroil the courts for years.13&#xD;
                              V&#xD;
  The ultimate question in this case is not whether a life&#xD;
without-parole sentence ‘fits’ the crime at issue here or the&#xD;
crimes of juvenile nonhomicide offenders more generally,&#xD;
but to whom the Constitution assigns that decision. The&#xD;
Florida Legislature has concluded that such sentences&#xD;
should be available for persons under 18 who commit&#xD;
certain crimes, and the trial judge in this case decided to&#xD;
impose that legislatively authorized sentence here. Be&#xD;
cause a life-without-parole prison sentence is not a “cruel&#xD;
and unusual” method of punishment under any standard,&#xD;
——————&#xD;
   13 It bears noting that Colorado, one of the five States that prohibit&#xD;
&#xD;
life-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders,&#xD;
permits such offenders to be sentenced to mandatory terms of impris&#xD;
onment for up to 40 years. Colo. Rev. Stat. §18–1.3–401(4)(b) (2009).&#xD;
In light of the volume of state and federal legislation that presently&#xD;
permits life-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offend&#xD;
ers, it would be impossible to argue that there is any objective evidence&#xD;
of agreement that a juvenile is constitutionally entitled to a parole&#xD;
hearing any sooner than 40 years after conviction. See Tr. of Oral Arg.&#xD;
6–7 (counsel for Graham, stating that, “[o]ur position is that it should&#xD;
be left up to the States to decide. We think that the . . . Colorado&#xD;
provision would probably be constitutional”).&#xD;

the Eighth Amendment gives this Court no authority to&#xD;
reject those judgments.&#xD;
  It would be unjustifiable for the Court to declare other&#xD;
wise even if it could claim that a bare majority of state laws&#xD;
supported its independent moral view. The fact that the&#xD;
Court categorically prohibits life-without-parole sentences&#xD;
for juvenile nonhomicide offenders in the face of an over&#xD;
whelming legislative majority in favor of leaving that sen&#xD;
tencing option available under certain cases simply illus&#xD;
trates how far beyond any cognizable constitutional&#xD;
principle the Court has reached to ensure that its own&#xD;
sense of morality and retributive justice pre-empts that of&#xD;
the people and their representatives.&#xD;
  I agree with JUSTICE STEVENS that “[w]e learn, some&#xD;
times, from our mistakes.” Ante, at 1 (concurring opinion).&#xD;
Perhaps one day the Court will learn from this one.&#xD;

&#xD;
                 FLORIDA &#xD;
&#xD;
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL&#xD;
              OF FLORIDA, FIRST DISTRICT&#xD;
              [May 17, 2010; modified July 6, 2010]&#xD;
&#xD;
   JUSTICE ALITO, dissenting.&#xD;
   I join Parts I and III of JUSTICE THOMAS’s dissenting&#xD;
opinion. I write separately to make two points.&#xD;
   First, the Court holds only that “for a juvenile offender&#xD;
who did not commit homicide the Eighth Amendment&#xD;
forbids the sentence of life without parole.” Ante, at 24&#xD;
(emphasis added). Nothing in the Court’s opinion affects&#xD;
the imposition of a sentence to a term of years without the&#xD;
possibility of parole. Indeed, petitioner conceded at oral&#xD;
argument that a sentence of as much as 40 years without&#xD;
the possibility of parole “probably” would be constitu&#xD;
tional. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6–7; see also ante, at 28, n. 12&#xD;
(THOMAS, J., dissenting).&#xD;
   Second, the question whether petitioner’s sentence&#xD;
violates the narrow, as-applied proportionality principle&#xD;
that applies to noncapital sentences is not properly before&#xD;
us in this case. Although petitioner asserted an as-applied&#xD;
proportionality challenge to his sentence before the Flor&#xD;
ida courts, see &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/fladistctapp/9ov1/graham-v-state/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;982&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;So. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;43&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;pre class="inline"&gt;, 51–53 (Fla. App. 2008), he&#xD;
did not include an as-applied claim in his petition for&#xD;
certiorari or in his merits briefs before this Court. In&#xD;
stead, petitioner argued for only a categorical rule banning&#xD;
the imposition of life without parole on any juvenile con&#xD;
victed of a nonhomicide offense. Because petitioner aban&#xD;
doned his as-applied claim, I would not reach that issue.&#xD;
