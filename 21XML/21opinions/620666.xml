&#xD;
&#xD;
 No. 10–8145. Argued November 8, 2011—Decided January 10, 2012&#xD;
Petitioner Juan Smith was convicted of first-degree murder based on&#xD;
  the testimony of a single eyewitness. During state postconviction re-&#xD;
  lief proceedings, Smith obtained police files containing statements by&#xD;
  the eyewitness contradicting his testimony. Smith argued that the&#xD;
  prosecution’s failure to disclose those statements violated Brady v.&#xD;
  Maryland, 373 U. S. 83. Brady held that due process bars a State&#xD;
  from withholding evidence that is favorable to the defense and mate-&#xD;
  rial to the defendant’s guilt or punishment. See id., at 87. The state&#xD;
  trial court rejected Smith’s Brady claim, and the Louisiana Court of&#xD;
  Appeal and Louisiana Supreme Court denied review.&#xD;
Held: Brady requires that Smith’s conviction be reversed. The State&#xD;
 does not dispute that the eyewitness’s statements were favorable to&#xD;
 Smith and that those statements were not disclosed to Smith. Under&#xD;
 Brady, evidence is material if there is a “reasonable probability that,&#xD;
 had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would&#xD;
 have been different.” Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. 449, 469–470. A “rea-&#xD;
 sonable probability” means that the likelihood of a different result is&#xD;
 great enough to “undermine[ ] confidence in the outcome of the trial.”&#xD;
 Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 434. Evidence impeaching an eye-&#xD;
 witness’s testimony may not be material if the State’s other evidence&#xD;
 is strong enough to sustain confidence in the verdict. United States v.&#xD;
 Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 112–113, and n. 21. Here, however, the eyewit-&#xD;
 ness’s testimony was the only evidence linking Smith to the crime,&#xD;
 and the eyewitness’s undisclosed statements contradicted his testi-&#xD;
 mony. The eyewitness’s statements were plainly material, and the&#xD;
 State’s failure to disclose those statements to the defense thus violat-&#xD;
 ed Brady. Pp. 2–4.&#xD;

JUAN SMITH, PETITIONER v. BURL CAIN, WARDEN&#xD;
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE ORLEANS PARISH CRIMINAL&#xD;
             DISTRICT COURT OF LOUISIANA&#xD;
                               [January 10, 2012]&#xD;
&#xD;
   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the&#xD;
Court.&#xD;
   The State of Louisiana charged petitioner Juan Smith&#xD;
with killing five people during an armed robbery. At&#xD;
Smith’s trial a single witness, Larry Boatner, linked Smith&#xD;
to the crime. Boatner testified that he was socializing at a&#xD;
friend’s house when Smith and two other gunmen entered&#xD;
the home, demanded money and drugs, and shortly there-&#xD;
after began shooting, resulting in the death of five of&#xD;
Boatner’s friends. In court Boatner identified Smith as&#xD;
the first gunman to come through the door. He claimed&#xD;
that he had been face to face with Smith during the initial&#xD;
moments of the robbery. No other witnesses and no physi-&#xD;
cal evidence implicated Smith in the crime.&#xD;
   The jury convicted Smith of five counts of first-degree&#xD;
murder. The Louisiana Court of Appeal affirmed Smith’s&#xD;
conviction. State v. Smith, 797 So. 2d 193 (2001). The&#xD;
Louisiana Supreme Court denied review, as did this&#xD;
Court. 2001–2416 (La. 9/13/02), 824 So. 2d 1189; 537 U. S.&#xD;
1201 (2003).&#xD;
   Smith then sought postconviction relief in the state&#xD;
courts. As part of his effort, Smith obtained files from the&#xD;
2                      SMITH v. CAIN&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
police investigation of his case, including those of the lead&#xD;
investigator, Detective John Ronquillo. Ronquillo’s notes&#xD;
contain statements by Boatner that conflict with his tes-&#xD;
timony identifying Smith as a perpetrator. The notes from&#xD;
the night of the murder state that Boatner “could not . . .&#xD;
supply a description of the perpetrators other then [sic]&#xD;
they were black males.” App. 252–253. Ronquillo also&#xD;
made a handwritten account of a conversation he had with&#xD;
Boatner five days after the crime, in which Boatner said&#xD;
he “could not ID anyone because [he] couldn’t see faces”&#xD;
and “would not know them if [he] saw them.” Id., at 308.&#xD;
And Ronquillo’s typewritten report of that conversation&#xD;
states that Boatner told Ronquillo he “could not identify&#xD;
any of the perpetrators of the murder.” Id., at 259–260.&#xD;
  Smith requested that his conviction be vacated, arguing,&#xD;
inter alia, that the prosecution’s failure to disclose Ron-&#xD;
quillo’s notes violated this Court’s decision in Brady v.&#xD;
Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). The state trial court re-&#xD;
jected Smith’s Brady claim, and the Louisiana Court of&#xD;
Appeal and Louisiana Supreme Court denied review. We&#xD;
granted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), and now reverse.&#xD;
  Under Brady, the State violates a defendant’s right to&#xD;
due process if it withholds evidence that is favorable to the&#xD;
defense and material to the defendant’s guilt or punish-&#xD;
ment. See 373 U. S., at 87. The State does not dispute&#xD;
that Boatner’s statements in Ronquillo’s notes were fa-&#xD;
vorable to Smith and that those statements were not dis-&#xD;
closed to him. The sole question before us is thus whether&#xD;
Boatner’s statements were material to the determination&#xD;
of Smith’s guilt. We have explained that “evidence is&#xD;
‘material’ within the meaning of Brady when there is a&#xD;
reasonable probability that, had the evidence been dis-&#xD;
closed, the result of the proceeding would have been dif-&#xD;
ferent.” Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. 449, 469–470 (2009). A&#xD;
reasonable probability does not mean that the defendant&#xD;
“would more likely than not have received a different&#xD;
                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            3&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
verdict with the evidence,” only that the likelihood of a&#xD;
different result is great enough to “undermine[] confidence&#xD;
in the outcome of the trial.” Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S.&#xD;
419, 434 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).&#xD;
   We have observed that evidence impeaching an eyewit-&#xD;
ness may not be material if the State’s other evidence is&#xD;
strong enough to sustain confidence in the verdict. See&#xD;
United States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 112–113, and n. 21&#xD;
(1976). That is not the case here. Boatner’s testimony&#xD;
was the only evidence linking Smith to the crime. And&#xD;
Boatner’s undisclosed statements directly contradict his&#xD;
testimony: Boatner told the jury that he had “[n]o doubt”&#xD;
that Smith was the gunman he stood “face to face” with on&#xD;
the night of the crime, but Ronquillo’s notes show Boatner&#xD;
saying that he “could not ID anyone because [he] couldn’t&#xD;
see faces” and “would not know them if [he] saw them.”&#xD;
App. 196, 200, 308. Boatner’s undisclosed statements&#xD;
were plainly material.&#xD;
   The State and the dissent advance various reasons why&#xD;
the jury might have discounted Boatner’s undisclosed&#xD;
statements. They stress, for example, that Boatner made&#xD;
other remarks on the night of the murder indicating that&#xD;
he could identify the first gunman to enter the house, but&#xD;
not the others. That merely leaves us to speculate about&#xD;
which of Boatner’s contradictory declarations the jury&#xD;
would have believed. The State also contends that Boat-&#xD;
ner’s statements made five days after the crime can be&#xD;
explained by fear of retaliation. Smith responds that the&#xD;
record contains no evidence of any such fear. Again, the&#xD;
State’s argument offers a reason that the jury could have&#xD;
disbelieved Boatner’s undisclosed statements, but gives us&#xD;
no confidence that it would have done so.&#xD;
   The police files that Smith obtained in state postconvic-&#xD;
tion proceedings contain other evidence that Smith con-&#xD;
tends is both favorable to him and material to the verdict.&#xD;
Because we hold that Boatner’s undisclosed statements&#xD;
4                      SMITH v. CAIN&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
alone suffice to undermine confidence in Smith’s convic-&#xD;
tion, we have no need to consider his arguments that the&#xD;
other undisclosed evidence also requires reversal under&#xD;
Brady.&#xD;
   The judgment of the Orleans Parish Criminal District&#xD;
Court of Louisiana is reversed, and the case is remanded&#xD;
for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
                                            It is so ordered.&#xD;

JUAN SMITH, PETITIONER v. BURL CAIN, WARDEN&#xD;
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE ORLEANS PARISH CRIMINAL&#xD;
             DISTRICT COURT OF LOUISIANA&#xD;
                      [January 10, 2012]&#xD;
&#xD;
   JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.&#xD;
   The Court holds that Juan Smith is entitled to a new&#xD;
murder trial because the State, in violation of Brady v.&#xD;
Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), did not disclose that the&#xD;
eyewitness who identified Smith at trial stated shortly&#xD;
after the murders that he could not identify any of the&#xD;
perpetrators. I respectfully dissent. In my view, Smith&#xD;
has not shown a “reasonable probability” that the jury&#xD;
would have been persuaded by the undisclosed evidence.&#xD;
United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 682 (1985) (opinion&#xD;
of Blackmun, J.). That materiality determination must be&#xD;
made “in the context of the entire record,” United States v.&#xD;
Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 112 (1976), and “turns on the cumu-&#xD;
lative effect of all such evidence suppressed by the gov-&#xD;
ernment,” Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 421 (1995).&#xD;
Applying these principles, I would affirm the judgment&#xD;
of the Louisiana trial court.&#xD;
                             I&#xD;
   The evidence presented at trial showed the following&#xD;
facts. On March 1, 1995, Larry Boatner and several&#xD;
friends gathered at Rebe Espadron’s home in New Or-&#xD;
leans. Boatner and others were drinking and talking in&#xD;
the kitchen when Boatner heard the loud sound of a car&#xD;
without a muffler outside. As Boatner opened the kitchen’s&#xD;
outside door to investigate the noise, armed men pushed&#xD;
2                         SMITH v. CAIN&#xD;
&#xD;
                       THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
their way through the door, demanding drugs and money.&#xD;
Tr. 153–154 (Dec. 5, 1995). The first man though the door&#xD;
put a gun in Boatner’s face and pushed him backwards.&#xD;
Id., at 154–155. The men initially ordered Boatner and&#xD;
his friends to the floor, but then ordered Boatner to stand&#xD;
up. At that time, the man who had been the first one&#xD;
through the door placed his gun under Boatner’s chin. Id.,&#xD;
at 156–157. When Boatner asked what the men wanted&#xD;
him to do, the first man struck Boatner on the back of the&#xD;
head with his gun, knocking Boatner back to the ground.&#xD;
Id., at 157–158.&#xD;
   After hearing the commotion, Espadron emerged from a&#xD;
back bedroom, where she had been when the men entered&#xD;
the house. As Espadron opened an inside door leading to&#xD;
the kitchen, a man with a “covering” over his mouth point-&#xD;
ed his gun at her face and ordered her to the floor. Id., at&#xD;
70–71. Disregarding his command, Espadron ran back&#xD;
toward the bedroom, at which point the intruders opened&#xD;
fire. Id., at 71–72, 159.&#xD;
   When the shooting was over, four people lay dead. A&#xD;
fifth person, 17-year-old Shelita Russell, was mortally&#xD;
wounded and died later at the hospital. Of those original-&#xD;
ly gathered in the house, the only survivors were Boatner,&#xD;
who suffered a severe laceration to his head from the first&#xD;
man’s blow but was otherwise uninjured; Espadron, who&#xD;
escaped unharmed; and Reginald Harbor, who had re-&#xD;
mained in a back bedroom during the shooting. The police&#xD;
also found a man named Phillip Young at the scene.&#xD;
Young was alive but had suffered a gunshot wound to the&#xD;
head. Because Boatner, Espadron, and Harbor had never&#xD;
seen Young before, the police surmised that Young had&#xD;
been one of the perpetrators.1&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  1 Young was indicted along with Smith for the murders, but he was&#xD;
&#xD;
deemed incompetent to stand trial due to the brain damage he suffered&#xD;

&#xD;
   New Orleans police officer Joseph Narcisse was a first&#xD;
responder to the scene of the shooting. He testified at trial&#xD;
that he encountered Boatner in the bathroom of Espa-&#xD;
dron’s home, where Boatner was attempting to care for the&#xD;
laceration to his head. According to Narcisse, “Mr. Boat-&#xD;
ner . . . had let inside the perpetrators and did see them.”&#xD;
Id., at 21 (Dec. 4, 1995). Narcisse further explained that&#xD;
Boatner “had a description” of the person that he saw, the&#xD;
details of which Narcisse could not recall. Id., at 32.&#xD;
   Detective John Ronquillo, the lead investigator of the&#xD;
shootings, testified that Boatner had described the first&#xD;
man through the kitchen door as having a “short-type&#xD;
haircut,” “a lot of golds in his teeth,” and “brown-ski[n].”2&#xD;
Id., at 115 (Dec. 5, 1995). Ronquillo further testified that&#xD;
Boatner could describe no other perpetrator, but that&#xD;
Boatner had viewed the first man twice: once when the&#xD;
man initially came through the door and again when&#xD;
Boatner was ordered to stand up and the man held a gun&#xD;
to his chin. Id., at 117–118.&#xD;
   Ronquillo also testified that, during the four months&#xD;
following the shootings, Boatner viewed 14 six-person&#xD;
photograph arrays of potential suspects—only one of&#xD;
which contained a picture of Smith. Id., at 89–100. Three&#xD;
weeks after the crime, Ronquillo presented Boatner with&#xD;
one of the arrays that did not include a picture of Smith.&#xD;
Ronquillo recalled that Boatner noted that one man in the&#xD;
array had a “similar haircut” and “a similar expression on&#xD;
his face” as the “gentleman that came into the house&#xD;
initially with the gun that [Boatner] confronted,” but that&#xD;

&#xD;
Boatner “was positive this wasn’t the individual.” Id., at&#xD;
97; see also 5 Record 828. A few months later, Ronquillo&#xD;
presented Boatner with the array that included a photo-&#xD;
graph of Smith. Tr. 99–101 (Dec. 5, 1995). Ronquillo&#xD;
testified that Boatner identified Smith “immediately,”&#xD;
stating, “ ‘This is it. I’ll never forget that face.’ ” Id., at&#xD;
100. Of the 84 photographs that Boatner viewed, Smith’s&#xD;
photograph was the only one that Boatner identified.&#xD;
   Boatner identified Smith again when he was called to&#xD;
the stand during Smith’s trial. Boatner testified that&#xD;
Smith’s face was the “[s]ame face,” id., at 174, and that&#xD;
Smith’s mouth was the “[s]ame mouth” “full of gold,” ibid.,&#xD;
as that of the first man who came through the kitchen&#xD;
door on the night of the attack. Boatner also testified that&#xD;
Smith’s hair at trial was “shaved on the sides” as it was&#xD;
during the crime, but that “the top was a little bit lower”&#xD;
at the time of the murders. Id., at 165. Boatner explain-&#xD;
ed that, during the attack, he had focused on the first&#xD;
man through the door—who was unmasked—but that he&#xD;
“didn’t notice” the faces of any of the other assailants or&#xD;
whether they were masked. Id., at 154. On cross-&#xD;
examination, Boatner testified that he had described the&#xD;
first man’s build, haircut, and gold teeth jewelry to the&#xD;
police. Id., at 178.&#xD;
   Based on this evidence, the jury convicted Smith of first-&#xD;
degree murder. Following the conclusion of direct review,&#xD;
Smith petitioned the trial court for postconviction relief.&#xD;
Smith argued that the State had failed to disclose various&#xD;
police notes revealing favorable evidence material to&#xD;
Smith’s guilt. As relevant here, those items include pre-&#xD;
trial statements by Boatner; statements by victim Shelita&#xD;
Russell and Espadron’s neighbor, Dale Mims; a pretrial&#xD;
statement by firearms examiner Kenneth Leary; state-&#xD;
ments by cosuspect Robert Trackling and Trackling’s&#xD;
fellow inmate, Eric Rogers; and a statement by cosuspect&#xD;
Phillip Young. After holding a 4-day evidentiary hearing,&#xD;

&#xD;
the postconviction judge—who had also presided over&#xD;
Smith’s 2-day trial—denied Smith’s Brady claims.&#xD;
  Like the postconviction court below, I conclude that&#xD;
Smith is not entitled to a new trial under Brady. In my&#xD;
view, Smith has not established a reasonable probability&#xD;
that the cumulative effect of this evidence would have&#xD;
caused the jury to change its verdict.&#xD;
                             II&#xD;
&#xD;
                             A&#xD;
&#xD;
  Smith first identifies two undisclosed statements by&#xD;
Boatner, which the Court concludes are “plainly material.”&#xD;
Ante, at 3. First, a note by Ronquillo, documenting a&#xD;
conversation he had with Boatner at the scene, states that&#xD;
Boatner “could not . . . supply a description of the perpe-&#xD;
trators other th[a]n they were black males.” 5 Record 809.&#xD;
Second, a handwritten note by Ronquillo, documenting a&#xD;
phone conversation he had with Boatner on March 6, five&#xD;
days after the murders, states that “Boatner . . . could not&#xD;
ID anyone because couldn’t see faces . . . glanced at 1st&#xD;
one—saw man—through door—can’t tell if had—faces&#xD;
covered didn’t see anyone . . . Could not ID—would not&#xD;
know them if—I saw them.” 13 id., at 2515. Ronquillo’s&#xD;
typed summary of this note states that Boatner advised&#xD;
him that he “could not identify any perpetrators of the&#xD;
murder.” 5 id., at 817.&#xD;
  Smith is correct that these undisclosed statements could&#xD;
have been used to impeach Boatner and Ronquillo during&#xD;
cross-examination. But the statements are not material&#xD;
for purposes of Brady because they cannot “reasonably be&#xD;
taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to&#xD;
undermine confidence in the verdict.” Kyles, 514 U. S., at&#xD;
435. When weighed against the substantial evidence that&#xD;
Boatner had opportunities to view the first perpetrator,&#xD;
offered consistent descriptions of him on multiple occa-&#xD;
sions, and even identified him as Smith, the undisclosed&#xD;
6                            SMITH v. CAIN&#xD;
&#xD;
                         THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
statements do not warrant a new trial.&#xD;
  The evidence showed that, notwithstanding Ronquillo’s&#xD;
on-scene note, Boatner offered a description of the perpe-&#xD;
trator at the scene. Officer Narcisse testified that Boatner&#xD;
provided him with a description of the perpetrator that&#xD;
Boatner saw. Narcisse’s testimony thus corroborated&#xD;
Boatner’s trial testimony that he saw the first man and&#xD;
described him to police.3 Narcisse’s testimony also miti-&#xD;
gated the impeachment value of Ronquillo’s on-scene note&#xD;
by indicating that, although Boatner may have provided&#xD;
no detailed description to Ronquillo at the scene, Boatner&#xD;
had described the first man to another officer.4&#xD;
  In any event, Ronquillo’s notes reflect that Boatner&#xD;
provided a description of the first perpetrator at the police&#xD;
station only a few hours after the shootings occurred. Tr.&#xD;
403 (Jan. 22, 2009). Boatner was asked if he could “de-&#xD;
scribe the subjects wh[o] shot the people in the house.” 5&#xD;
Record 866. He responded: “I can tell you about one, the&#xD;
one who put the pistol in my face, he was a black male&#xD;
with a low cut, gold[s] in his mouth . . . about my complex-&#xD;
ion, brown skinned.” Ibid. When asked, “[Y]ou say you&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
——————&#xD;
    3 Ina pretrial hearing, Boatner testified that he “gave a description&#xD;
to the officer that came to the scene.” Tr. 24 (Oct. 27, 1995). Boatner&#xD;
responded negatively when asked whether this officer was Detective&#xD;
Ronquillo. Ibid. Boatner further testified that he told the officer that&#xD;
the first man through the door was “heavy built with his hair with a&#xD;
fade, with a little small top with a lot of gold teeth in his mouth.” Ibid.&#xD;
That testimony was consistent with the testimony that Boatner and&#xD;
Officer Narcisse gave at trial.&#xD;
  4 Moreover, Boatner’s reticence toward Ronquillo at the scene of the&#xD;
&#xD;
crime was entirely understandable. As Ronquillo noted at the postcon-&#xD;
viction hearing, “there were dead bodies everywhere,” and Boatner was&#xD;
“a little shook up.” Id., at 402–403 (Jan. 22, 2009). Similarly, Narcisse&#xD;
testified at trial that Boatner, while “not as frantic” as Espadron, was a&#xD;
“bit emotional” when Narcisse encountered him at the scene. Id., at 34&#xD;
(Dec. 4, 1995).&#xD;

&#xD;
can’t describe any of the other shooters besides the one&#xD;
who put the gun in your face after you opened the door,”&#xD;
Boatner replied, “No, I can’t.” Ibid. In his brief, Smith&#xD;
cites this station house statement as an example of favor-&#xD;
able, undisclosed evidence. But this statement actually&#xD;
corroborates Boatner’s trial testimony that he saw and&#xD;
described the first perpetrator to police and that he did not&#xD;
get a good look at the other assailants. Moreover, the&#xD;
description Boatner provided was consistent with Smith’s&#xD;
appearance. The Court completely ignores Boatner’s&#xD;
station house statement, but our cases instruct us to&#xD;
evaluate “the net effect of the evidence withheld by the&#xD;
State” in assessing materiality. See Kyles, supra, at 421–&#xD;
422.&#xD;
   The evidence not only shows that Boatner described the&#xD;
first perpetrator twice in the immediate aftermath of the&#xD;
crime, but also that Boatner described him again three&#xD;
weeks later when he viewed a photograph array and elim-&#xD;
inated a similar-looking individual. The evidence before&#xD;
the jury further indicated that, several months after the&#xD;
crime, Boatner confidently identified Smith in an array,&#xD;
after evincing a discriminating, careful eye over a 4-month&#xD;
investigative period. What is more, the reliability of&#xD;
Boatner’s out-of-court identification was extensively tested&#xD;
during cross-examination at Smith’s trial. In particular,&#xD;
Boatner was asked whether the fact that he saw Smith’s&#xD;
picture in a newspaper article naming Smith as a suspect&#xD;
had tainted his identification. Boatner did not waiver,&#xD;
responding, “I picked out the person I seen come in that&#xD;
house that held a gun to my head and under my chin and&#xD;
the person that was there when all my friends died.” Tr.&#xD;
190 (Dec. 5, 1995). That Boatner credibly rejected defense&#xD;
counsel’s “suggestion” theory is supported by the fact that&#xD;
Boatner did not identify cosuspect Robert Trackling—&#xD;
whose photograph was included in a separate array shown&#xD;
to Boatner on the same day that Boatner identified&#xD;

&#xD;
                    THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
Smith—even though Trackling’s picture was next to&#xD;
Smith’s in the same newspaper article. 5 Record 833, 835.&#xD;
   When weighed against Boatner’s repeated and con-&#xD;
sistent descriptions and confident out-of-court and in-court&#xD;
identifications, Boatner’s March 6 statement is also imma-&#xD;
terial. As an initial matter, Ronquillo’s note of his March&#xD;
6 conversation with Boatner contains an internal contra-&#xD;
diction that undercuts its impeachment value. Although&#xD;
the note states that Boatner “didn’t see anyone,” it also&#xD;
states that Boatner “glanced at 1st one—saw man—&#xD;
through door.” 13 id., at 2515. The latter part is con-&#xD;
sistent with Boatner’s repeated statements that he only&#xD;
saw the first man through the door. Moreover, the jury&#xD;
would have evaluated any equivocation in Boatner’s&#xD;
statement in light of the fact that he made it a mere five&#xD;
days after a traumatic shooting, when the perpetrators&#xD;
were still at large. The jury would have considered Boat-&#xD;
ner’s trial testimony that, following the murders of his&#xD;
friends, he began having nightmares, had difficulty sleep-&#xD;
ing, quit his job, and began drinking heavily—so much so&#xD;
that he checked into a hospital for substance abuse treat-&#xD;
ment and grief counseling. Tr. 162–163, 170–171, 182&#xD;
(Dec. 5, 1995). Any impeachment value in the March 6&#xD;
note would have been further mitigated by the fact that,&#xD;
as Ronquillo explained, “on the night of the incident&#xD;
[Boatner] said that he could [identify someone] and he&#xD;
gave a description that was very close to Mr. Smith’s&#xD;
description.” Id., at 401 (Jan. 22, 2009). And, following&#xD;
his March 6 conversation with Ronquillo, Boatner viewed&#xD;
numerous photograph arrays, described the first perpetra-&#xD;
tor, and ultimately identified him as Smith.&#xD;
   Of course, had the jury been presented with Ronquillo’s&#xD;
notes of Boatner’s on-scene and March 6 statements, it&#xD;
might have believed that Boatner could not identify any of&#xD;
the perpetrators, but a possibility of a different verdict is&#xD;
insufficient to establish a Brady violation. See Strickler v.&#xD;

&#xD;
Greene, 527 U. S. 263, 291 (1999); see also Agurs, 427&#xD;
U. S., at 109–110 (“The mere possibility that an item of&#xD;
undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or&#xD;
might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not es-&#xD;
tablish ‘materiality’ in the constitutional sense.” Rather,&#xD;
a “petitioner’s burden is to establish a reasonable prob-&#xD;
ability of a different result.” Strickler, supra, at 291.&#xD;
  Instead of requiring Smith to show a reasonable proba-&#xD;
bility that Boatner’s undisclosed statements would have&#xD;
caused the jury to acquit, the Court improperly requires&#xD;
the State to show that the jury would have given Boatner’s&#xD;
undisclosed statements no weight. See ante, at 3 (“[T]he&#xD;
State’s argument offers a reason that the jury could have&#xD;
disbelieved Boatner’s undisclosed statements, but gives us&#xD;
no confidence that it would have done so”). But Smith&#xD;
is not entitled to a new trial simply because the jury&#xD;
could have accorded some weight to Boatner’s undisclosed&#xD;
statements. Smith’s burden is to show a reasonable prob-&#xD;
ability that the jury would have accorded those statements&#xD;
sufficient weight to alter its verdict. In light of the record&#xD;
as a whole—which the Court declines to consider—Smith&#xD;
has not carried that burden.&#xD;
                             B&#xD;
   Smith also argues that statements by Shelita Russell&#xD;
and Dale Mims documented in Ronquillo’s handwritten&#xD;
notes could have been used to impeach Boatner’s identifi-&#xD;
cation of Smith because the statements indicate that&#xD;
the perpetrators were masked. One undated note, which&#xD;
contains several entries about various aspects of the inves-&#xD;
tigation, states, “female—face down against cabinets—&#xD;
conscious.” On the next line, the note continues, “said—in&#xD;
kitchen saw people barge in—one—black cloth across&#xD;
face—first one through door—[no further statement].” 13&#xD;

&#xD;
                         THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
statement of Russell, Ronquillo confirmed that the note&#xD;
was in his handwriting, but he testified that he never&#xD;
talked to Russell, that he did not know when the note was&#xD;
made, and that someone else could have relayed the in-&#xD;
formation to him. Tr. 415–418 (Jan. 22, 2009).5 I will&#xD;
assume arguendo that, had this note been disclosed, it&#xD;
would have been admissible at Smith’s trial as a dying&#xD;
declaration of Russell.6 But the note would have had&#xD;
minimal impeachment value because, contrary to Smith’s&#xD;
assertions, it is ambiguous in light of the context in which&#xD;
the statement was made. Officer Narcisse testified that&#xD;
Russell was conscious and able to talk, but that she was in&#xD;
“bad condition.” Id., at 20 (Dec. 4, 1995). Similarly, Reg-&#xD;
inald Harbor testified that, as Russell lay wounded, she&#xD;
was “whining” and he “didn’t catch nothing [t]hat she&#xD;
said.” Id., at 205 (Dec. 5, 1995). And, although Smith&#xD;
contends that the note says “exactly” that the “first person&#xD;
through the door had a black cloth across his face,” that&#xD;
is not how the note reads. Reply Brief for Petitioner 11&#xD;
(emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted)&#xD;
(hereinafter Reply Brief). The note first states that the&#xD;
declarant “saw people barge in,” then states “one—black&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
——————&#xD;
   5 Russell did not make this statement to Officer Narcisse. He testi-&#xD;
&#xD;
fied that Russell “was not able to give us any information or any details&#xD;
of what had happened.” Id., at 20.&#xD;
   6 Louisiana law provides that “[a] statement made by a declarant&#xD;
&#xD;
while believing that his death was imminent, concerning the cause or&#xD;
circumstances of what he believed to be his impending death[,]” is “not&#xD;
excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a wit-&#xD;
ness.” La. Code Evid. Ann., Art. 804(B)(2) (West Supp. 2012). Assum-&#xD;
ing this statement was actually Russell’s, it likely qualifies as a dying&#xD;
declaration. At trial, Boatner testified that, in the aftermath of the&#xD;
shooting, Russell told him, “Feel like I’m about to die.” Tr. 161 (Dec. 5,&#xD;
1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Espadron also testified that&#xD;
Russell told her, “I’m gonna die,” and, “Don’t let me die.” Id., at 73–74&#xD;
(internal quotation marks omitted).&#xD;

&#xD;
cloth across face—first one through door—[no further&#xD;
statement].” 13 Record 2556 (emphasis added). It is at&#xD;
least as logical to read this statement as indicating only&#xD;
that “one” of the “people” had a “black cloth across [his]&#xD;
face.” Russell, suffering from fatal wounds, said nothing&#xD;
further after “first one through door,” and it is impossible&#xD;
to know whether the “first one” was also the “one” with a&#xD;
“black cloth across [his] face.”&#xD;
  The second statement Smith identifies is that of Dale&#xD;
Mims, who lived down the street from Espadron’s home&#xD;
and who heard the shooting. A note by Ronquillo states&#xD;
that Mims saw four males fleeing Espadron’s home, “all&#xD;
wearing mask[s].” Id., at 2518. Like Russell’s purported&#xD;
statement, this statement has minimal impeachment&#xD;
value in light of the record. Mims’ undisclosed statement&#xD;
does not address whether some or all of the perpetrators&#xD;
were masked inside Espadron’s home.7 Moreover, had&#xD;
Mims been called as a witness at trial, he presumably&#xD;
would have testified, as he did at the postconviction hear-&#xD;
ing, that he was “positive” that he only saw three perpe-&#xD;
trators fleeing, and that, of those three, only two were&#xD;
masked. Tr. 269, 271–273, 275 (Jan. 13, 2009).&#xD;
  Both Russell’s purported statement and Mims’ testimo-&#xD;
ny are consistent with Boatner’s testimony that he did not&#xD;
know whether any of the other perpetrators were masked,&#xD;
id., at 154 (Dec. 5, 1995), and with Officer Narcisse’s and&#xD;
Espadron’s testimony that the single perpetrator whom&#xD;
Espadron observed was wearing some sort of face cover-&#xD;
&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  7 Smith ridicules the “exceedingly peculiar” notion that the perpetra-&#xD;
&#xD;
tors would have remained unmasked inside Espadron’s home, only to&#xD;
mask themselves before leaving the scene. Reply Brief 12–13. But that&#xD;
notion is eminently reasonable if the perpetrators intended to massacre&#xD;
the witnesses who were inside the home—as they did—and were&#xD;
concerned only with disguising themselves from neighbors outside who&#xD;
might see or hear the burglary.&#xD;
12                     SMITH v. CAIN&#xD;
&#xD;
                    THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
ing, id., at 30–31 (Dec. 4, 1995); id., at 71 (Dec. 5, 1995).&#xD;
Thus, the totality of the evidence indicates that some, but&#xD;
not all, of the perpetrators were masked, a conclusion that&#xD;
in no way undermines Boatner’s consistent assertions that&#xD;
the only perpetrator he saw was unmasked.&#xD;
                             C&#xD;
   Smith also contends that Ronquillo’s undisclosed note&#xD;
documenting a pretrial statement by firearms examiner&#xD;
Kenneth Leary is material for purposes of Brady. The&#xD;
note states that “Leary advised Ronquillo that the 9MM&#xD;
ammunition confiscated from [the scene of the murders]&#xD;
was typed to have been fired from a[n] [Intratec], ‘Mac[-]&#xD;
11’ model type, semi automatic weapon.” 5 Record 831.&#xD;
According to Smith, this statement conflicts with Leary’s&#xD;
trial testimony that the 9-millimeter ammunition found&#xD;
at the scene “was fired by one particular weapon, one 9-&#xD;
millimeter handgun,” Tr. 132 (Dec. 5, 1995), because an&#xD;
Intratec or Mac-11 pistol is not a “handgun.” Smith fur-&#xD;
ther argues that Leary’s pretrial statement could have&#xD;
been used to exculpate Smith, whose guilt the prosecution&#xD;
attempted to show by calling a pathologist to testify that&#xD;
Shelita Russell’s wounds could have been inflicted by a&#xD;
9-millimeter “handgun,” id., at 39 (Dec. 4, 1995), and by&#xD;
calling Boatner to testify that the gun Smith held under&#xD;
his chin was a 9-millimeter silver “hand gun,” id., at 157&#xD;
(Dec. 5, 1995).&#xD;
   Contrary to Smith’s contentions, Leary’s pretrial state-&#xD;
ment does not undermine the evidence presented at trial.&#xD;
Leary’s pretrial statement is consistent with his and&#xD;
Boatner’s trial testimony because an Intratec or Mac-11&#xD;
pistol is a 9-millimeter handgun. Smith concedes that&#xD;
such a weapon uses 9-millimeter cartridges. Brief for&#xD;
Petitioner 48. Moreover, a “handgun” is simply “[a] fire-&#xD;
arm that can be used with one hand,” American Heritage&#xD;
Dictionary 819 (3d ed. 1992), and no one disputes that an&#xD;
                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   13&#xD;
&#xD;
                         THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
Intratec or Mac-11 pistol can be used with one hand.&#xD;
Smith nonetheless insists that, “as a colloquial matter,&#xD;
machine pistols of the Intratec or MAC-11 type would be&#xD;
considered automatic or semiautomatic weapons, rather&#xD;
than handguns.” Reply Brief 18. But even assuming that&#xD;
Smith is correct, he fails to explain why Leary, a firearms&#xD;
expert, would have been expected to use colloquial rather&#xD;
than technical terminology.8&#xD;
  The record also makes clear that, when Boatner used&#xD;
the term “handgun,” he did not understand it to exclude&#xD;
automatic or semiautomatic machine pistols. In the im-&#xD;
mediate aftermath of the murders, as well as at trial,&#xD;
Boatner stated that a second perpetrator carried a “Ma[c]&#xD;
10” or “Tech Nine” “Uzi” type weapon, Tr. 159, 179 (Dec. 5,&#xD;
1995); 5 Record 809, 813, 866, and Boatner described that&#xD;
weapon as a “handgun,” id., at 809. Moreover, Boatner’s&#xD;
pretrial description of the silver or chrome “handgun” that&#xD;
the first man held was consistent with Leary’s undisclosed&#xD;
statement that the gun that fired the 9-millimeter ammu-&#xD;
nition found at the scene was a semiautomatic weapon. In&#xD;
his station house statement, Boatner described the first&#xD;
man’s weapon as a “big,” “automatic pistol.” Id., at 813,&#xD;
866. Because Leary’s pretrial statement is neither im-&#xD;
peaching nor exculpatory, Leary’s undisclosed statement&#xD;
cannot form the basis of a Brady violation. See Strickler,&#xD;
&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  8 Smith argues that Leary himself considered an “[Intratec] or ‘Mac[-]&#xD;
11’ ” model type to be different from a 9-millimeter handgun. Smith&#xD;
relies on the fact that Leary’s pretrial statement indicated that the&#xD;
ammunition recovered from the scene did not come from the handgun&#xD;
recovered from Donielle Bannister, another suspect in the murders.&#xD;
Id., at 18. Leary’s pretrial statement did not describe the handgun&#xD;
recovered from Bannister as a 9-millimeter, contrary to Smith’s repre-&#xD;
sentation. More importantly, Leary’s statement suggests only that&#xD;
Bannister’s handgun did not fire the 9-millimeter ammunition found at&#xD;
the scene, not that Leary did not consider an “[Intratec] or ‘Mac[-]11’ ”&#xD;
model type to be a handgun.&#xD;

527 U. S., at 281–282 (To make out a Brady viola-&#xD;
tion, “[t]he evidence at issue must be favorable to the&#xD;

impeaching”).&#xD;
                              D&#xD;
   Smith next points to purportedly exculpatory and ma-&#xD;
terial undisclosed pretrial statements made by Robert&#xD;
Trackling, a member of the “Cut Throat Posse” street gang&#xD;
with which Smith was allegedly associated, and by Eric&#xD;
Rogers, an inmate who was incarcerated with Trackling.&#xD;
5 Record 845. Police notes reflect that Eric Rogers gave an&#xD;
interview to investigators on May 19, 1995, during which&#xD;
he described a conversation that he had with Trackling&#xD;
while in prison. During that conversation, Trackling&#xD;
described the murders at Espadron’s home and stated that&#xD;
he had committed the crime along with “Fat, Buckle, and&#xD;
a guy they call uh, Short Dog.” Id., at 841. According to&#xD;
Rogers, Fat’s real name was “Darnell [Donielle] Banister,”&#xD;
Buckle’s real name was “Contez [Kintad] Phillips,” and&#xD;
Short Dog’s real name was “Juan.” Id., at 843–844.&#xD;
   Smith contends that Rogers’ interview was exculpatory&#xD;
in two respects. First, he points to the following comment&#xD;
by Rogers later during the interview: “They call Contez&#xD;
Philip Buckle, they call Darnell Banister Fat, Short Dog&#xD;
that’s what they call him, they call Robert Home.” Id., at&#xD;
845. Smith suggests that Rogers’ prior identification of&#xD;
“Short Dog” as “Juan [Smith]” was equivocal in light of his&#xD;
later statement that “Short Dog” was a man named “Rob-&#xD;
ert Home.” Reply Brief 21. Second, Smith asserts that&#xD;
disclosure of Rogers’ interview would have led the defense&#xD;
and the jury to learn of Rogers’ allegation—made for the&#xD;
first time 10 years after Smith’s trial—that the police had&#xD;
asked him to implicate Juan Smith as “Short Dog,” Tr.&#xD;
284–285 (Jan. 13, 2009).&#xD;
   Neither argument is persuasive. If the jury had learned&#xD;
                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                  15&#xD;
&#xD;
                        THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
of Rogers’ statement, it would have heard information&#xD;
directly inculpating Smith as “Short Dog,” a perpetrator of&#xD;
the shootings. Rogers’ physical description of “Short&#xD;
Dog”—“he[’s] short[,] he[’s] got golds going across his&#xD;
mouth[,] and . . . he’s like built,” 5 Record 844–also corrob-&#xD;
orated Boatner’s description of the first man through the&#xD;
door as having a “mouth full of gold” and a “heavy” build.&#xD;
Furthermore, Smith ignores other inculpatory information&#xD;
documented in Ronquillo’s notes of Rogers’ statement.&#xD;
Those notes reflect Trackling’s own interview with police&#xD;
on June 1, 1995, in which Trackling identified Phillips,&#xD;
Bannister, and “Juan Smith” as the perpetrators of the&#xD;
murders at Espadron’s home. Id., at 832; see also id., at&#xD;
854–855. Trackling’s statement only strengthens the&#xD;
inculpatory nature of Rogers’ interview.&#xD;
  Further, the jury assuredly would not have believed&#xD;
Smith’s suggestion that Rogers identified “Short Dog” as a&#xD;
man named “Robert Home.” When this statement is taken&#xD;
in context, it appears that Rogers was describing the&#xD;
nickname—“Home”9—of Robert Trackling, the “Robert”&#xD;
whom Rogers had repeatedly referenced throughout his&#xD;
interview. See id., at 839–850. Indeed, Rogers’ phrase-&#xD;
ology, “they call Robert Home,” was consistent with his pre-&#xD;
vious comments that “[t]hey call Contez Philip Buckle,”&#xD;
and “they call Darnell Banister Fat.” Id., at 845 (emphasis&#xD;
added). Unsurprisingly, in the thousands of pages of&#xD;

   If the jury had heard Rogers’ postconviction testimony&#xD;
that police asked him to implicate Smith and that Track-&#xD;
ling’s description of the murders did not include Smith, Tr.&#xD;
284–285 (Jan. 13, 2009), it would have weighed Rogers’&#xD;
allegation against Trackling’s own statement to the police&#xD;
that Smith had participated in the murders at Espadron’s&#xD;
home, 5 Record 832. The prosecution also would have&#xD;
called Smith’s sister, Trinieze Smith, to testify that she&#xD;
believed her brother was known as “Short Dog,” as she did&#xD;
at the postconviction hearing. Tr. 371 (Jan. 14, 2009). On&#xD;

  Finally, Smith argues that an undisclosed handwritten&#xD;
note by Ronquillo documenting a statement by Phillip&#xD;
Young—the man found injured at the scene and suspected&#xD;
of having participated in the crime—is also material evi-&#xD;
dence warranting a new trial. At trial, Ronquillo testified&#xD;
that he met with Young while Young was hospitalized as a&#xD;
result of permanent brain damage suffered in the shoot-&#xD;

  10 Detective Byron Adams, who took Rogers’ statement, did not testify&#xD;
&#xD;
at the postconviction hearing because he had died in the meantime. He&#xD;
thus had no opportunity to address Rogers’ recantation or his newly&#xD;
minted allegation that Detective Adams asked Rogers to implicate&#xD;
Smith. Smith argues that “there is no reason to believe that . . . Adams&#xD;
would have contradicted Rogers—much less that the jury would have&#xD;
believed [him] if [he] did.” Reply Brief 21. But Smith offers no support&#xD;
for his dubious assertion that Detective Adams would have admitted to&#xD;
framing Smith, or that, had the detective denied the allegation, the jury&#xD;
would have believed Rogers—a convicted murderer who never ex-&#xD;
plained any motive Adams would have had to frame Smith—over the&#xD;
detective.&#xD;

ings. Id., at 102 (Dec. 5, 1995). According to Ronquillo,&#xD;
Young “was strapped to a chair. He really couldn’t talk,&#xD;
[h]e mumbled. He could use his left hand, that was all.&#xD;
He couldn’t walk or anything. He was fed through a tube&#xD;
by the people there. He was in really bad shape.” Id., at&#xD;
102–103. When asked whether Young was able to com-&#xD;
municate with him “at all,” Ronquillo responded, “No. I&#xD;
couldn’t understand anything that he was saying.” Id., at&#xD;
103.&#xD;
  The undisclosed note from Ronquillo’s meeting with&#xD;
Young reads as follows: “Short Dog/Bucko/Fats—No—&#xD;
Didn’t shoot me—No—Not with me when went to house—&#xD;
Yes—one of people in house shot me—No—Not responsi-&#xD;
ble—‘Posse’—Didn’t drive to house—‘Posse’—Yes—Knows&#xD;
names of perps—Yes—Drove in car—Yes—girlfriend’s&#xD;
car.” 13 Record 2568. Smith contends that this note is&#xD;
exculpatory in that it suggests that he was “not involved”&#xD;
in the shootings. Brief for Petitioner 43.&#xD;
  Young’s statement is only exculpatory if Smith concedes&#xD;
(as the statement asserts) that he is, in fact, “Short Dog”&#xD;
and a member of the “Cut Throat Posse.” Such a conces-&#xD;
sion would only have strengthened the inculpatory value&#xD;
of the statements by Rogers and Trackling indicating that&#xD;
Smith was the “Short Dog” who committed the murders at&#xD;
Espadron’s home. In any event, the exculpatory value of&#xD;
the note is minimal for several other reasons. First, it is&#xD;
unclear whether Ronquillo’s note reflects a statement by&#xD;
Young that the “Posse” was not responsible for shooting&#xD;
the victims or a statement that the “Posse” was not re-&#xD;
sponsible for shooting Young. Further, the statement that&#xD;
“Short Dog” and others were not with Young when he went&#xD;
to the house is certainly not a clear statement that “Short&#xD;
Dog” did not commit the murders, especially in light of&#xD;
evidence in the record that the assailants used two cars on&#xD;

the night of the murders.11 Second, had the jury learned&#xD;
of Ronquillo’s note, it would have presumably heard Ron-&#xD;
quillo testify, as he did at the postconviction hearing, that&#xD;
he was not even sure whether his note actually reflected&#xD;
statements by Young, given that Young “couldn’t talk,”&#xD;
was “jumbled,” could only “kind of move his head,” and&#xD;
sometimes would just sit and stare when Ronquillo asked&#xD;
a question.12 Tr. 423–424 (Jan. 22, 2009). Accordingly,&#xD;
Ronquillo explained, “I never had hide nor hair actually of&#xD;
what [Young] said.” Id., at 423.&#xD;
   The jury thus would have evaluated Ronquillo’s note, of&#xD;
unclear exculpatory value on its face, against a backdrop&#xD;
of doubt as to what, if anything, Young actually communi-&#xD;
cated. The jury also would have weighed this evidence&#xD;
against the strongly inculpatory nature of Boatner’s de-&#xD;
scriptions and identifications and Rogers’ and Trackling’s&#xD;
statements, which corroborated Boatner’s identification.&#xD;
When all of the evidence is considered cumulatively, as it&#xD;
must be, Smith has not shown a reasonable probability&#xD;
that the jury would have reached a different verdict.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  11 In his station house statement, Boatner explained that the loud car&#xD;
that arrived at Espadron’s home was white. 5 Record 866. In Rogers’&#xD;
interview with the police, Rogers said that Trackling escaped from&#xD;
Espadron’s home in a burgundy car. Id., at 842.&#xD;
   12 Smith also contends that the defense could have used the undis-&#xD;
&#xD;
closed note to impeach Ronquillo’s trial testimony that Young was not&#xD;
able to communicate with him “at all.” That argument lacks merit.&#xD;
Ronquillo’s trial testimony, when read in context, does not suggest that&#xD;
no communication occurred. Rather, Ronquillo made clear that he&#xD;
simply “couldn’t understand anything that [Young] was saying.” See Tr.&#xD;
103 (Dec. 5, 1995) (emphasis added). That testimony is consistent with&#xD;
the garbled nature of the note, and the note thus would have had little,&#xD;
if any, impeachment value.&#xD;

   The question presented here is not whether a prudent&#xD;
prosecutor should have disclosed the information that&#xD;
Smith identifies. Rather, the question is whether the cu-&#xD;
mulative effect of the disclosed and undisclosed evidence&#xD;
in Smith’s case “put[s] the whole case in such a different&#xD;
light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.” Kyles,&#xD;
514 U. S., at 435. When, as in this case, the Court departs&#xD;
from its usual practice of declining to review alleged mis-&#xD;
applications of settled law to particular facts, id., at 456&#xD;
(SCALIA, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and KENNEDY and&#xD;
THOMAS, JJ., dissenting), the Court should at least consid-&#xD;
er all of the facts. And, the Court certainly should not&#xD;
decline to review all of the facts on the assumption that&#xD;
the remainder of the record would only further support&#xD;
Smith’s claims, as the Court appears to have done here.&#xD;
Ante, at 3–4.&#xD;
   Such an assumption is incorrect. Here, much of the&#xD;
record evidence confirms that, from the night of the mur-&#xD;
ders through trial, Boatner consistently described—with&#xD;
one understandable exception—the first perpetrator&#xD;
through the door, that Boatner’s description matched&#xD;
Smith, and that Boatner made strong out-of-court and in-&#xD;
court identifications implicating Smith. Some of the un-&#xD;
disclosed evidence cited by Smith is not favorable to him&#xD;
at all, either because it is of no impeachment or exculpa-&#xD;
tory value or because it actually inculpates him. Because&#xD;
what remains is evidence of such minimal impeachment&#xD;
and exculpatory value as to be immaterial in light of the&#xD;
whole record, I must dissent from the Court’s holding that&#xD;
the State violated Brady.&#xD;
