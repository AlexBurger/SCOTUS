 TOWN OF CASTLE ROCK, COLORADO v. GONZALES,&#xD;
INDIVIDUALLY AND AS NEXT BEST FRIEND OF HER DECEASED&#xD;
         MINOR CHILDREN, GONZALES ET AL.&#xD;
&#xD;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&#xD;
                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT&#xD;
&#xD;
      No. 04–278.      Argued March 21, 2005—Decided June 27, 2005&#xD;
Respondent filed this suit under 42 U. S. C. §1983 alleging that peti-&#xD;
  tioner violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause&#xD;
  when its police officers, acting pursuant to official policy or custom,&#xD;
  failed to respond to her repeated reports over several hours that her&#xD;
  estranged husband had taken their three children in violation of her&#xD;
  restraining order against him. Ultimately, the husband murdered&#xD;
  the children. The District Court granted the town’s motion to dis-&#xD;
  miss, but an en banc majority of the Tenth Circuit reversed, finding&#xD;
  that respondent had alleged a cognizable procedural due process&#xD;
  claim because a Colorado statute established the state legislature’s&#xD;
  clear intent to require police to enforce retraining orders, and thus its&#xD;
  intent that the order’s recipient have an entitlement to its enforce-&#xD;
  ment. The court therefore ruled, among other things, that respon-&#xD;
  dent had a protected property interest in the enforcement of her re-&#xD;
  straining order.&#xD;
Held: Respondent did not, for Due Process Clause purposes, have a&#xD;
 property interest in police enforcement of the restraining order&#xD;
 against her husband. Pp. 6–19.&#xD;
    (a) The Due Process Clause’s procedural component does not pro-&#xD;
 tect everything that might be described as a government “bene-&#xD;
 fit”: “To have a property interest in a benefit, a person . . . must . . .&#xD;
 have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.” Board of Regents of State&#xD;
 Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 577. Such entitlements are created by&#xD;
 existing rules or understandings stemming from an independent source&#xD;
 such as state law. E.g., ibid. Pp. 6–7.&#xD;
2                     CASTLE ROCK v. GONZALES&#xD;
&#xD;
                                  Syllabus&#xD;
&#xD;
       (b) A benefit is not a protected entitlement if officials have discre-&#xD;
    tion to grant or deny it. See, e.g., Kentucky Dept. of Corrections v.&#xD;
    Thompson, 490 U. S. 454, 462–463. It is inappropriate here to defer&#xD;
    to the Tenth Circuit’s determination that Colorado law gave respon-&#xD;
    dent a right to police enforcement of the restraining order. This&#xD;
    Court therefore proceeds to its own analysis. Pp. 7–9.&#xD;
       (c) Colorado law has not created a personal entitlement to enforce-&#xD;
    ment of restraining orders. It does not appear that state law truly&#xD;
    made such enforcement mandatory. A well-established tradition of&#xD;
    police discretion has long coexisted with apparently mandatory arrest&#xD;
    statutes. Cf. Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S. 41, 47, n. 2, 62, n. 32.&#xD;
    Against that backdrop, a true mandate of police action would require&#xD;
    some stronger indication than the Colorado statute’s direction to “use&#xD;
    every reasonable means to enforce a restraining order” or even to “ar-&#xD;
    rest . . . or . . . seek a warrant.” A Colorado officer would likely have&#xD;
    some discretion to determine that—despite probable cause to believe&#xD;
    a restraining order has been violated—the violation’s circumstances&#xD;
    or competing duties counsel decisively against enforcement in a par-&#xD;
    ticular instance. The practical necessity for discretion is particularly&#xD;
    apparent in a case such as this, where the suspected violator is not&#xD;
    actually present and his whereabouts are unknown. In such circum-&#xD;
    stances, the statute does not appear to require officers to arrest but&#xD;
    only to seek a warrant. That, however, would be an entitlement to&#xD;
    nothing but procedure, which cannot be the basis for a property in-&#xD;
    terest. Pp. 9–15.&#xD;
       (d) Even if the statute could be said to make enforcement “manda-&#xD;
    tory,” that would not necessarily mean that respondent has an enti-&#xD;
    tlement to enforcement. Her alleged interest stems not from common&#xD;
    law or contract, but only from a State’s statutory scheme. If she was&#xD;
    given a statutory entitlement, the Court would expect to see some in-&#xD;
    dication of that in the statute itself. Although the statute spoke of&#xD;
    “protected person[s]” such as respondent, it did so in connection with&#xD;
    matters other than a right to enforcement. Most importantly, it&#xD;
    spoke directly to the protected person’s power to “initiate” contempt&#xD;
    proceedings if the order was issued in a civil action, which contrasts&#xD;
    tellingly with its conferral of a power merely to “request” initiation of&#xD;
    criminal contempt proceedings—and even more dramatically with its&#xD;
    complete silence about any power to “request” (much less demand)&#xD;
    that an arrest be made. Pp. 15–17.&#xD;
       (e) Even were the Court to think otherwise about Colorado’s crea-&#xD;
    tion of an entitlement, it is not clear that an individual entitlement to&#xD;
    enforcement of a restraining order could constitute a “property” in-&#xD;
    terest for due process purposes. Such a right would have no ascer-&#xD;
    tainable monetary value and would arise incidentally, not out of some&#xD;

  new species of government benefit or service, but out of a function&#xD;
  that government actors have always performed—arresting people&#xD;
  when they have probable cause. A benefit’s indirect nature was fatal&#xD;
  to a due process claim in O’Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center, 447&#xD;
  U. S. 773, 787. Here, as there, “[t]he simple distinction between gov-&#xD;
  ernment action that directly affects a citizen’s legal rights . . . and ac-&#xD;
  tion that is directed against a third party and affects the citizen only&#xD;
  . . . incidentally, provides a sufficient answer to” cases finding gov-&#xD;

 TOWN OF CASTLE ROCK, COLORADO, PETITIONER&#xD;
  v. JESSICA GONZALES, INDIVIDUALLY AND AS NEXT&#xD;
     BEST FRIEND OF HER DECEASED MINOR CHILDREN,&#xD;
          REBECCA GONZALES, KATHERYN&#xD;
               GONZALES, AND LESLIE&#xD;
                      GONZALES&#xD;
 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&#xD;
            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT&#xD;
                                 [June 27, 2005]&#xD;
&#xD;
  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.&#xD;
  We decide in this case whether an individual who has&#xD;
obtained a state-law restraining order has a constitution-&#xD;
ally protected property interest in having the police en-&#xD;
force the restraining order when they have probable cause&#xD;
to believe it has been violated.&#xD;
                               I&#xD;
   The horrible facts of this case are contained in the com-&#xD;
plaint that respondent Jessica Gonzales filed in Federal&#xD;
District Court. (Because the case comes to us on appeal&#xD;
from a dismissal of the complaint, we assume its allega-&#xD;
tions are true. See Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534 U. S.&#xD;
506, 508, n. 1 (2002).) Respondent alleges that petitioner,&#xD;
the town of Castle Rock, Colorado, violated the Due Proc-&#xD;
ess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United&#xD;
States Constitution when its police officers, acting pursu-&#xD;
ant to official policy or custom, failed to respond properly&#xD;

&#xD;
                          Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
to her repeated reports that her estranged husband was&#xD;
violating the terms of a restraining order.1&#xD;
  The restraining order had been issued by a state trial&#xD;
court several weeks earlier in conjunction with respon-&#xD;
dent’s divorce proceedings. The original form order, issued&#xD;
on May 21, 1999, and served on respondent’s husband on&#xD;
June 4, 1999, commanded him not to “molest or disturb&#xD;
the peace of [respondent] or of any child,” and to remain at&#xD;
least 100 yards from the family home at all times. 366&#xD;
F. 3d 1093, 1143 (CA10 2004) (en banc) (appendix to dis-&#xD;
senting opinion of O’Brien, J.). The bottom of the pre-&#xD;
printed form noted that the reverse side contained&#xD;
“IMPORTANT NOTICES FOR RESTRAINED PARTIES&#xD;
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.” Ibid. (empha-&#xD;
sis deleted). The preprinted text on the back of the form&#xD;
included the following “WARNING”:&#xD;
     “A KNOWING VIOLATION OF A RESTRAINING&#xD;
     ORDER IS A CRIME . . . . A VIOLATION WILL&#xD;
     ALSO CONSTITUTE CONTEMPT OF COURT. YOU&#xD;
     MAY BE ARRESTED WITHOUT NOTICE IF A&#xD;
     LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER HAS PROBABLE&#xD;
     CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE&#xD;
     KNOWINGLY VIOLATED THIS ORDER.” Id., at&#xD;
     1144.&#xD;
The preprinted text on the back of the form also included a &#xD;
&#xD;
“NOTICE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS,” &#xD;
&#xD;
which read in part: &#xD;

&#xD;
  1 Petitioner claims that respondent’s complaint “did not allege . . .&#xD;
&#xD;
that she ever notified the police of her contention that [her husband]&#xD;
was actually in violation of the restraining order.” Brief for Petitioner&#xD;
7, n. 2. The complaint does allege, however, that respondent “showed&#xD;
[the police] a copy of the [temporary restraining order (TRO)] and&#xD;
requested that it be enforced.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 126a. At this&#xD;
stage in the litigation, we may assume that this reasonably implied the&#xD;
order was being violated. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environ-&#xD;
ment, 523 U. S. 83, 104 (1998).&#xD;

&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
    “YOU SHALL USE EVERY REASONABLE MEANS&#xD;
    TO ENFORCE THIS RESTRAINING ORDER. YOU&#xD;
    SHALL ARREST, OR, IF AN ARREST WOULD BE&#xD;
    IMPRACTICAL UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,&#xD;
    SEEK A WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF THE&#xD;
    RESTRAINED PERSON WHEN YOU HAVE&#xD;
    INFORMATION AMOUNTING TO PROBABLE&#xD;
    CAUSE THAT THE RESTRAINED PERSON HAS&#xD;
    VIOLATED OR ATTEMPTED TO VIOLATE ANY&#xD;
    PROVISION OF THIS ORDER AND THE&#xD;
    RESTRAINED PERSON HAS BEEN PROPERLY&#xD;
    SERVED WITH A COPY OF THIS ORDER OR HAS&#xD;
    RECEIVED ACTUAL NOTICE OF THE EXISTENCE&#xD;
    OF THIS ORDER.” Ibid.&#xD;
   On June 4, 1999, the state trial court modified the terms&#xD;
of the restraining order and made it permanent. The&#xD;
modified order gave respondent’s husband the right to&#xD;
spend time with his three daughters (ages 10, 9, and 7) on&#xD;
alternate weekends, for two weeks during the summer,&#xD;
and, “ ‘upon reasonable notice,’ ” for a mid-week dinner&#xD;
visit “ ‘arranged by the parties’ ”; the modified order also&#xD;
allowed him to visit the home to collect the children for&#xD;
such “parenting time.” Id., at 1097 (majority opinion).&#xD;
   According to the complaint, at about 5 or 5:30 p.m. on&#xD;
Tuesday, June 22, 1999, respondent’s husband took the&#xD;
three daughters while they were playing outside the fam-&#xD;
ily home. No advance arrangements had been made for&#xD;
him to see the daughters that evening. When respondent&#xD;
noticed the children were missing, she suspected her&#xD;
husband had taken them. At about 7:30 p.m., she called&#xD;
the Castle Rock Police Department, which dispatched two&#xD;
officers. The complaint continues: “When [the officers]&#xD;
arrived . . . , she showed them a copy of the TRO and&#xD;
requested that it be enforced and the three children be&#xD;
returned to her immediately. [The officers] stated that&#xD;
4                  CASTLE ROCK v. GONZALES&#xD;
&#xD;
                        Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
there was nothing they could do about the TRO and sug-&#xD;
gested that [respondent] call the Police Department again&#xD;
if the three children did not return home by 10:00 p.m.”&#xD;
App. to Pet. for Cert. 126a.2&#xD;
    At approximately 8:30 p.m., respondent talked to her&#xD;
husband on his cellular telephone. He told her “he had the&#xD;
three children [at an] amusement park in Denver.” Ibid.&#xD;
She called the police again and asked them to “have some-&#xD;
one check for” her husband or his vehicle at the amuse-&#xD;
ment park and “put out an [all points bulletin]” for her&#xD;
husband, but the officer with whom she spoke “refused to&#xD;
do so,” again telling her to “wait until 10:00 p.m. and see&#xD;
if ” her husband returned the girls. Id., at 126a–127a.&#xD;
    At approximately 10:10 p.m., respondent called the&#xD;
police and said her children were still missing, but she&#xD;
was now told to wait until midnight. She called at mid-&#xD;
night and told the dispatcher her children were still miss-&#xD;
ing. She went to her husband’s apartment and, finding&#xD;
nobody there, called the police at 12:10 a.m.; she was told&#xD;
to wait for an officer to arrive. When none came, she went&#xD;
to the police station at 12:50 a.m. and submitted an inci-&#xD;
dent report. The officer who took the report “made no&#xD;
reasonable effort to enforce the TRO or locate the three&#xD;
children. Instead, he went to dinner.” Id., at 127a.&#xD;
    At approximately 3:20 a.m., respondent’s husband&#xD;
arrived at the police station and opened fire with a semi-&#xD;
automatic handgun he had purchased earlier that eve-&#xD;
ning. Police shot back, killing him. Inside the cab of his&#xD;
pickup truck, they found the bodies of all three daughters,&#xD;
whom he had already murdered. Ibid.&#xD;
    On the basis of the foregoing factual allegations, re-&#xD;
&#xD;
——————&#xD;
    2 It&#xD;
      is unclear from the complaint, but immaterial to our decision,&#xD;
whether respondent showed the police only the original “TRO” or also&#xD;
the permanent, modified restraining order that had superseded it on&#xD;
June 4.&#xD;

&#xD;
                         Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
spondent brought an action under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42&#xD;
U. S. C. §1983, claiming that the town violated the Due&#xD;
Process Clause because its police department had “an&#xD;
official policy or custom of failing to respond properly to&#xD;
complaints of restraining order violations” and “tolerate[d]&#xD;
the non-enforcement of restraining orders by its police&#xD;
officers.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 129a.3 The complaint also&#xD;
alleged that the town’s actions “were taken either will-&#xD;
fully, recklessly or with such gross negligence as to indi-&#xD;
cate wanton disregard and deliberate indifference to”&#xD;
respondent’s civil rights. Ibid.&#xD;
  Before answering the complaint, the defendants filed a&#xD;
motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure&#xD;
12(b)(6). The District Court granted the motion, conclud-&#xD;
ing that, whether construed as making a substantive due&#xD;
process or procedural due process claim, respondent’s&#xD;
complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be&#xD;
granted.&#xD;
  A panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the rejection of&#xD;
a substantive due process claim, but found that respon-&#xD;
dent had alleged a cognizable procedural due process&#xD;
claim. 307 F. 3d 1258 (CA10 2002). On rehearing en&#xD;
banc, a divided court reached the same disposition, con-&#xD;
cluding that respondent had a “protected property interest&#xD;
in the enforcement of the terms of her restraining order”&#xD;
and that the town had deprived her of due process because&#xD;
“the police never ‘heard’ nor seriously entertained her&#xD;
request to enforce and protect her interests in the re-&#xD;
straining order.” 366 F. 3d, at 1101, 1117. We granted&#xD;
certiorari. 543 U. S. ___ (2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  3 Three police officers were also named as defendants in the com-&#xD;
&#xD;
plaint, but the Court of Appeals concluded that they were entitled to&#xD;
qualified immunity, 366 F. 3d 1093, 1118 (CA10 2004) (en banc).&#xD;
Respondent did not file a cross-petition challenging that aspect of the&#xD;
judgment.&#xD;
6                 CASTLE ROCK v. GONZALES&#xD;
&#xD;
                      Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
                                II&#xD;
   The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Con-&#xD;
stitution provides that a State shall not “deprive any&#xD;
person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of&#xD;
law.” Amdt. 14, §1. In 42 U. S. C. §1983, Congress has&#xD;
created a federal cause of action for “the deprivation of any&#xD;
rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitu-&#xD;
tion and laws.” Respondent claims the benefit of this&#xD;
provision on the ground that she had a property interest&#xD;
in police enforcement of the restraining order against her&#xD;
husband; and that the town deprived her of this property&#xD;
without due process by having a policy that tolerated&#xD;
nonenforcement of restraining orders.&#xD;
   As the Court of Appeals recognized, we left a similar&#xD;
question unanswered in DeShaney v. Winnebago County&#xD;
Dept. of Social Servs., 489 U. S. 189 (1989), another case&#xD;
with “undeniably tragic” facts: Local child-protection&#xD;
officials had failed to protect a young boy from beatings by&#xD;
his father that left him severely brain damaged. Id., at&#xD;
191–193. We held that the so-called “substantive” compo-&#xD;
nent of the Due Process Clause does not “requir[e] the&#xD;
State to protect the life, liberty, and property of its citizens&#xD;
against invasion by private actors.” Id., at 195. We noted,&#xD;
however, that the petitioner had not properly preserved&#xD;
the argument that—and we thus “decline[d] to consider”&#xD;
whether—state “child protection statutes gave [him] an&#xD;
‘entitlement’ to receive protective services in accordance&#xD;
with the terms of the statute, an entitlement which would&#xD;
enjoy due process protection.” Id., at 195, n. 2.&#xD;
   The procedural component of the Due Process Clause&#xD;
does not protect everything that might be described as a&#xD;
“benefit”: “To have a property interest in a benefit, a per-&#xD;
son clearly must have more than an abstract need or&#xD;
desire” and “more than a unilateral expectation of it. He&#xD;
must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to&#xD;
it.” Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S.&#xD;

564, 577 (1972). Such entitlements are “ ‘of course, . . . not&#xD;
created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and&#xD;
their dimensions are defined by existing rules or under-&#xD;
standings that stem from an independent source such as&#xD;
state law.’ ” Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S. 693, 709 (1976) (quot-&#xD;
ing Roth, supra, at 577); see also Phillips v. Washington&#xD;
Legal Foundation, 524 U. S. 156, 164 (1998).&#xD;
                               A&#xD;
   Our cases recognize that a benefit is not a protected&#xD;
entitlement if government officials may grant or deny it in&#xD;
their discretion. See, e.g., Kentucky Dept. of Corrections v.&#xD;
Thompson, 490 U. S. 454, 462–463 (1989). The Court of&#xD;
Appeals in this case determined that Colorado law created&#xD;
an entitlement to enforcement of the restraining order&#xD;
because the “court-issued restraining order . . . specifically&#xD;
dictated that its terms must be enforced” and a “state stat-&#xD;
ute command[ed]” enforcement of the order when certain&#xD;
objective conditions were met (probable cause to believe that&#xD;
the order had been violated and that the object of the order&#xD;
had received notice of its existence). 366 F. 3d, at 1101, n. 5;&#xD;
see also id., at 1100, n. 4; id., at 1104–1105, and n. 9. Re-&#xD;
spondent contends that we are obliged “to give deference&#xD;
to the Tenth Circuit’s analysis of Colorado law on”&#xD;
whether she had an entitlement to enforcement of the&#xD;
restraining order. Tr. of Oral Arg. 52.&#xD;
   We will not, of course, defer to the Tenth Circuit on the&#xD;
ultimate issue: whether what Colorado law has given&#xD;
respondent constitutes a property interest for purposes of&#xD;
the Fourteenth Amendment. That determination, despite&#xD;
its state-law underpinnings, is ultimately one of federal&#xD;
constitutional law. “Although the underlying substantive&#xD;
interest is created by ‘an independent source such as state&#xD;
law,’ federal constitutional law determines whether that&#xD;
interest rises to the level of a ‘legitimate claim of entitle-&#xD;
ment’ protected by the Due Process Clause.” Memphis&#xD;

                          Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
Light, Gas &amp; Water Div. v. Craft, 436 U. S. 1, 9 (1978)&#xD;
(emphasis added) (quoting Roth, supra, at 577); cf. United&#xD;
States ex rel. TVA v. Powelson, 319 U. S. 266, 279 (1943).&#xD;
Resolution of the federal issue begins, however, with a&#xD;
determination of what it is that state law provides. In the&#xD;
context of the present case, the central state-law question&#xD;
is whether Colorado law gave respondent a right to police&#xD;
enforcement of the restraining order. It is on this point&#xD;
that respondent’s call for deference to the Tenth Circuit is&#xD;
relevant.&#xD;
   We have said that a “presumption of deference [is] given&#xD;
the views of a federal court as to the law of a State within&#xD;
its jurisdiction.” Phillips, supra, at 167. That presump-&#xD;
tion can be overcome, however, see Leavitt v. Jane L., 518&#xD;
U. S. 137, 145 (1996) (per curiam), and we think deference&#xD;
inappropriate here. The Tenth Circuit’s opinion, which&#xD;
reversed the Colorado District Judge, did not draw upon a&#xD;
deep well of state-specific expertise, but consisted primarily&#xD;
of quoting language from the restraining order, the statu-&#xD;
tory text, and a state-legislative-hearing transcript. See 366&#xD;
F. 3d, at 1103–1109. These texts, moreover, say nothing&#xD;
distinctive to Colorado, but use mandatory language that&#xD;
(as we shall discuss) appears in many state and federal&#xD;
statutes. As for case law: the only state-law cases about&#xD;
restraining orders that the Court of Appeals relied upon&#xD;
were decisions of Federal District Courts in Ohio and Penn-&#xD;
sylvania and state courts in New Jersey, Oregon, and Ten-&#xD;
nessee. Id., at 1104–1105, n. 9, 1109.4 Moreover, if we were&#xD;

    4 Most&#xD;
         of the Colorado-law cases cited by the Court of Appeals ap-&#xD;
peared in footnotes declaring them to be irrelevant because they&#xD;
involved only substantive due process (366 F. 3d, at 1100–1101, nn. 4–&#xD;
5), only statutes without restraining orders (id., at 1101, n. 5), or&#xD;
Colorado’s Government Immunity Act, which the Court of Appeals&#xD;
concluded applies “only to . . . state tort law claims” (id., at 1108–1109,&#xD;
n. 12). Our analysis is likewise unaffected by the Immunity Act or by&#xD;
the way that Colorado has dealt with substantive due process or cases&#xD;

&#xD;
                          Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
simply to accept the Court of Appeals’ conclusion, we would&#xD;
necessarily have to decide conclusively a federal constitu-&#xD;
tional question (i.e., whether such an entitlement consti-&#xD;
tuted property under the Due Process Clause and, if so,&#xD;
whether petitioner’s customs or policies provided too little&#xD;
process to protect it). We proceed, then, to our own analysis&#xD;
of whether Colorado law gave respondent a right to en-&#xD;
forcement of the restraining order.5&#xD;
                              B&#xD;
  The critical language in the restraining order came not&#xD;
from any part of the order itself (which was signed by the&#xD;
state-court trial judge and directed to the restrained party,&#xD;
respondent’s husband), but from the preprinted notice to&#xD;
law-enforcement personnel that appeared on the back of&#xD;
the order. See supra, at 2–3. That notice effectively re-&#xD;
stated the statutory provision describing “peace officers’&#xD;
duties” related to the crime of violation of a restraining&#xD;
order. At the time of the conduct at issue in this case, that&#xD;
provision read as follows:&#xD;
        “(a) Whenever a restraining order is issued, the pro-&#xD;
     tected person shall be provided with a copy of such or-&#xD;
     der. A peace officer shall use every reasonable means&#xD;
     to enforce a restraining order.&#xD;
        “(b) A peace officer shall arrest, or, if an arrest&#xD;
     would be impractical under the circumstances, seek a&#xD;
——————&#xD;
that do not involve restraining orders.&#xD;
  5 In something of an anyone-but-us approach, the dissent simultane-&#xD;
&#xD;
ously (and thus unpersuasively) contends not only that this Court&#xD;
should certify a question to the Colorado Supreme Court, post, at 5–7&#xD;
(opinion of STEVENS, J.), but also that it should defer to the Tenth&#xD;
Circuit (which itself did not certify any such question), post, at 3–4. No&#xD;
party in this case has requested certification, even as an alternative&#xD;
disposition. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 56 (petitioner’s counsel “disfavor[ing]”&#xD;
certification); id., at 25–26 (counsel for the United States arguing&#xD;
against certification). At oral argument, in fact, respondent’s counsel&#xD;
declined JUSTICE STEVENS’ invitation to request it. Id., at 53.&#xD;

     scribed in paragraph (b) of this subsection (3), a peace&#xD;
     officer shall assume that the information received&#xD;
     from the registry is accurate. A peace officer shall en-&#xD;
     force a valid restraining order whether or not there is a&#xD;
     record of the restraining order in the registry.” Colo.&#xD;
     Rev. Stat. §18–6–803.5(3) (Lexis 1999) (emphases&#xD;
     added).&#xD;
The Court of Appeals concluded that this statutory provi-&#xD;
sion—especially taken in conjunction with a statement&#xD;
from its legislative history,6 and with another statute&#xD;
restricting criminal and civil liability for officers making&#xD;
arrests7—established the Colorado Legislature’s clear&#xD;
——————&#xD;
    6 The Court of Appeals quoted one lawmaker’s description of how the&#xD;
&#xD;
bill “ ‘would really attack the domestic violence problems’ ”:&#xD;
 “ ‘[T]he entire criminal justice system must act in a consistent manner,&#xD;
which does not now occur. The police must make probable cause&#xD;
arrests. The prosecutors must prosecute every case. Judges must&#xD;
apply appropriate sentences, and probation officers must monitor their&#xD;
probationers closely. And the offender needs to be sentenced to of-&#xD;
fender-specific therapy.&#xD;
    “ ‘[T]he entire system must send the same message . . . [that] violence&#xD;
is criminal. And so we hope that House Bill 1253 starts us down this&#xD;
road.’ ” 366 F. 3d, at 1107 (quoting Tr. of Colorado House Judiciary&#xD;
Hearings on House Bill 1253, Feb. 15, 1994) (emphases omitted).&#xD;
    7 Under Colo. Rev. Stat. §18–6–803.5(5) (Lexis 1999), “[a] peace officer&#xD;

ing a restraining order” was not to be held civilly or criminally liable&#xD;

intent “to alter the fact that the police were not enforcing&#xD;
domestic abuse retraining orders,” and thus its intent&#xD;
“that the recipient of a domestic abuse restraining order&#xD;
have an entitlement to its enforcement.” 366 F. 3d, at&#xD;
1108. Any other result, it said, “would render domestic&#xD;
abuse restraining orders utterly valueless.” Id., at 1109.&#xD;
  This last statement is sheer hyperbole. Whether or not&#xD;
respondent had a right to enforce the restraining order, it&#xD;
rendered certain otherwise lawful conduct by her husband&#xD;
both criminal and in contempt of court. See §§18–6–&#xD;
803.5(2)(a), (7). The creation of grounds on which he could&#xD;
be arrested, criminally prosecuted, and held in contempt&#xD;
was hardly “valueless”—even if the prospect of those&#xD;
sanctions ultimately failed to prevent him from commit-&#xD;
ting three murders and a suicide.&#xD;
  We do not believe that these provisions of Colorado law&#xD;
truly made enforcement of restraining orders mandatory.&#xD;
A well established tradition of police discretion has long&#xD;
coexisted with apparently mandatory arrest statutes.&#xD;
      “In each and every state there are long-standing&#xD;
    statutes that, by their terms, seem to preclude nonen-&#xD;
    forcement by the police. . . . However, for a number of&#xD;
    reasons, including their legislative history, insuffi-&#xD;
    cient resources, and sheer physical impossibility, it&#xD;
    has been recognized that such statutes cannot be in-&#xD;
    terpreted literally. . . . [T]hey clearly do not mean&#xD;
    that a police officer may not lawfully decline to make&#xD;
    an arrest. As to third parties in these states, the full-&#xD;
    enforcement statutes simply have no effect, and their&#xD;
    significance is further diminished.” 1 ABA Standards&#xD;

12                  CASTLE ROCK v. GONZALES&#xD;
&#xD;
                         Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
    The deep-rooted nature of law-enforcement discretion,&#xD;
even in the presence of seemingly mandatory legislative&#xD;
commands, is illustrated by Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S.&#xD;
41 (1999), which involved an ordinance that said a police&#xD;
officer “ ‘shall order’ ” persons to disperse in certain circum-&#xD;
stances, id., at 47, n. 2. This Court rejected out of hand the&#xD;
possibility that “the mandatory language of the ordinance&#xD;
. . . afford[ed] the police no discretion.” Id., at 62, n. 32. It&#xD;
is, the Court proclaimed, simply “common sense that all&#xD;
police officers must use some discretion in deciding when&#xD;
and where to enforce city ordinances.” Ibid. (emphasis&#xD;
added).&#xD;
    Against that backdrop, a true mandate of police action&#xD;
would require some stronger indication from the Colorado&#xD;
Legislature than “shall use every reasonable means to&#xD;
enforce a restraining order” (or even “shall arrest . . . or&#xD;
. . . seek a warrant”), §§18–6–803.5(3)(a), (b). That lan-&#xD;
guage is not perceptibly more mandatory than the Colo-&#xD;
rado statute which has long told municipal chiefs of police&#xD;
that they “shall pursue and arrest any person fleeing from&#xD;
justice in any part of the state” and that they “shall ap-&#xD;
prehend any person in the act of committing any offense&#xD;
. . . and, forthwith and without any warrant, bring such&#xD;
person before a . . . competent authority for examination&#xD;
and trial.” Colo. Rev. Stat. §31–4–112 (Lexis 2004). It is&#xD;
hard to imagine that a Colorado peace officer would not&#xD;
have some discretion to determine that—despite probable&#xD;
cause to believe a restraining order has been violated—the&#xD;
circumstances of the violation or the competing duties of&#xD;
that officer or his agency counsel decisively against en-&#xD;
forcement in a particular instance.8 The practical neces-&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  8 Respondent in fact concedes that an officer may “properly” decide&#xD;
&#xD;
not to enforce a restraining order when the officer deems “a technical&#xD;
violation” too “immaterial” to justify arrest. Respondent explains this&#xD;
as a determination that there is no probable cause. Brief for Respon-&#xD;
dent 28. We think, however, that a determination of no probable cause&#xD;
                     Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                   13&#xD;
&#xD;
                         Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
sity for discretion is particularly apparent in a case such&#xD;
as this one, where the suspected violator is not actually&#xD;
present and his whereabouts are unknown. Cf. Donaldson&#xD;
v. Seattle, 65 Wash. App. 661, 671–672, 831 P. 2d 1098,&#xD;
1104 (1992) (“There is a vast difference between a manda-&#xD;
tory duty to arrest [a violator who is on the scene] and a&#xD;
mandatory duty to conduct a follow up investigation [to&#xD;
locate an absent violator]. . . . A mandatory duty to inves-&#xD;
tigate would be completely open-ended as to priority,&#xD;
duration and intensity”).&#xD;
   The dissent correctly points out that, in the specific&#xD;
context of domestic violence, mandatory-arrest statutes&#xD;
have been found in some States to be more mandatory&#xD;
than traditional mandatory-arrest statutes. Post, at 7–13&#xD;
(opinion of STEVENS, J.). The Colorado statute mandating&#xD;
arrest for a domestic-violence offense is different from but&#xD;
related to the one at issue here, and it includes similar&#xD;
though not identical phrasing. See Colo. Rev. Stat. §18–6–&#xD;
803.6(1) (Lexis 1999) (“When a peace officer determines&#xD;
that there is probable cause to believe that a crime or&#xD;
offense involving domestic violence . . . has been commit-&#xD;
ted, the officer shall, without undue delay, arrest the&#xD;
person suspected of its commission . . .”). Even in the&#xD;
domestic-violence context, however, it is unclear how the&#xD;
mandatory-arrest paradigm applies to cases in which the&#xD;
offender is not present to be arrested. As the dissent&#xD;
explains, post, at 9–10, and n. 8, much of the impetus for&#xD;
mandatory-arrest statutes and policies derived from the&#xD;
idea that it is better for police officers to arrest the aggres-&#xD;
sor in a domestic-violence incident than to attempt to&#xD;
mediate the dispute or merely to ask the offender to leave&#xD;
the scene. Those other options are only available, of&#xD;
course, when the offender is present at the scene. See&#xD;
—————— &#xD;
&#xD;
to believe a violation has occurred is quite different from a determina-&#xD;
&#xD;
tion that the violation is too insignificant to pursue. &#xD;

1849, 1860 (1996) (“[T]he clear trend in police practice is&#xD;

   As one of the cases cited by the dissent, post, at 12,&#xD;
recognized, “there will be situations when no arrest is&#xD;
possible, such as when the alleged abuser is not in the&#xD;
home.” Donaldson, 65 Wash. App., at 674, 831 P. 2d, at&#xD;
1105 (emphasis added). That case held that Washington’s&#xD;
mandatory-arrest statute required an arrest only in “cases&#xD;
where the offender is on the scene,” and that it “d[id] not&#xD;
create an on-going mandatory duty to conduct an investi-&#xD;
gation” to locate the offender. Id., at 675, 831 P. 2d, at&#xD;
1105. Colorado’s restraining-order statute appears to&#xD;
contemplate a similar distinction, providing that when&#xD;
arrest is “impractical”—which was likely the case when&#xD;
the whereabouts of respondent’s husband were un-&#xD;
known—the officers’ statutory duty is to “seek a warrant”&#xD;
rather than “arrest.” §18–6–803.5(3)(b).&#xD;
   Respondent does not specify the precise means of en-&#xD;
forcement that the Colorado restraining-order statute&#xD;
assertedly mandated—whether her interest lay in having&#xD;
police arrest her husband, having them seek a warrant for&#xD;
his arrest, or having them “use every reasonable means,&#xD;
up to and including arrest, to enforce the order’s terms,”&#xD;

&#xD;
                           Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
identity of the alleged entitlement is vague. See Roth, 408&#xD;
U. S., at 577 (considering whether “certain benefits” were&#xD;
“secure[d]” by rule or understandings); cf. Natale v. Ridge-&#xD;
field, 170 F. 3d 258, 263 (CA2 1999) (“There is no reason&#xD;
. . . to restrict the ‘uncertainty’ that will preclude existence&#xD;
of a federally protectable property interest to the uncer-&#xD;
tainty that inheres in the exercise of discretion”). The&#xD;
dissent, after suggesting various formulations of the enti-&#xD;
tlement in question,10 ultimately contends that the obliga-&#xD;
tions under the statute were quite precise: either make an&#xD;
arrest or (if that is impractical) seek an arrest warrant,&#xD;
post, at 14. The problem with this is that the seeking of&#xD;
an arrest warrant would be an entitlement to nothing but&#xD;
procedure—which we have held inadequate even to sup-&#xD;
port standing, see Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S.&#xD;
555 (1992); much less can it be the basis for a property&#xD;
interest. See post, at 3–4 (SOUTER, J., concurring). After&#xD;
the warrant is sought, it remains within the discretion of a&#xD;
judge whether to grant it, and after it is granted, it remains&#xD;
within the discretion of the police whether and when to&#xD;
execute it.11 Respondent would have been assured nothing&#xD;
but the seeking of a warrant. This is not the sort of “enti-&#xD;
tlement” out of which a property interest is created.&#xD;
    Even if the statute could be said to have made enforce-&#xD;
ment of restraining orders “mandatory” because of the&#xD;

   10 See post, at 1 (“entitlement to police protection”); post, at 2 (“enti-&#xD;

the government’s commitment to provide police enforcement in certain&#xD;

the enforcement of her restraining order”); post, at 20 (the “service” of&#xD;
“protection from her husband”); post, at 21–22 (“interest in the en-&#xD;
forcement of the restraining order”).&#xD;
   11 The dissent asserts that the police would lack discretion in the&#xD;
&#xD;
execution of this warrant, post, at 13–14, n. 12, but cites no statute&#xD;
mandating immediate execution. The general Colorado statute govern-&#xD;
ing arrest provides that police “may arrest” when they possess a war-&#xD;
rant “commanding” arrest. Colo. Rev. Stat. §16–3–102(1) (Lexis 1999).&#xD;

&#xD;
                      Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
domestic-violence context of the underlying statute, that&#xD;
would not necessarily mean that state law gave respon-&#xD;
dent an entitlement to enforcement of the mandate. Mak-&#xD;
ing the actions of government employees obligatory can&#xD;
serve various legitimate ends other than the conferral of a&#xD;
benefit on a specific class of people. See, e.g., Sandin v.&#xD;
Conner, 515 U. S. 472, 482 (1995) (finding no constitution-&#xD;
ally protected liberty interest in prison regulations phrased&#xD;
in mandatory terms, in part because “[s]uch guidelines are&#xD;
not set forth solely to benefit the prisoner”). The serving of&#xD;
public rather than private ends is the normal course of the&#xD;
criminal law because criminal acts, “besides the injury&#xD;
[they do] to individuals, . . . strike at the very being of&#xD;
society; which cannot possibly subsist, where actions of&#xD;
this sort are suffered to escape with impunity.” 4 W.&#xD;
Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 5&#xD;
(1769); see also Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U. S. 657, 668&#xD;
(1892). This principle underlies, for example, a Colorado&#xD;
district attorney’s discretion to prosecute a domestic as-&#xD;
sault, even though the victim withdraws her charge. See&#xD;
People v. Cunefare, 102 P. 3d 302, 311–312 (Colo. 2004)&#xD;
(Bender, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part, and&#xD;
dissenting in part to the judgment).&#xD;
   Respondent’s alleged interest stems only from a State’s&#xD;
statutory scheme—from a restraining order that was&#xD;
authorized by and tracked precisely the statute on which&#xD;
the Court of Appeals relied. She does not assert that she&#xD;
has any common-law or contractual entitlement to en-&#xD;
forcement. If she was given a statutory entitlement, we&#xD;
would expect to see some indication of that in the statute&#xD;
itself. Although Colorado’s statute spoke of “protected&#xD;
person[s]” such as respondent, it did so in connection with&#xD;
matters other than a right to enforcement. It said that a&#xD;
“protected person shall be provided with a copy of [a re-&#xD;
straining] order” when it is issued, §18–6–803.5(3)(a); that&#xD;
a law enforcement agency “shall make all reasonable&#xD;

“shall give [to the protected person] a copy” of the report it&#xD;
submits to the court that issued the order, §18–6–&#xD;
803.5(3)(e). Perhaps most importantly, the statute spoke&#xD;
directly to the protected person’s power to “initiate con-&#xD;
tempt proceedings against the restrained person if the&#xD;
order [was] issued in a civil action or request the prosecut-&#xD;
ing attorney to initiate contempt proceedings if the order&#xD;
[was] issued in a criminal action.” §18–6–803.5(7). The&#xD;
protected person’s express power to “initiate” civil con-&#xD;
tempt proceedings contrasts tellingly with the mere ability&#xD;
to “request” initiation of criminal contempt proceedings—&#xD;
and even more dramatically with the complete silence&#xD;
about any power to “request” (much less demand) that an&#xD;
arrest be made.&#xD;
  The creation of a personal entitlement to something as&#xD;
vague and novel as enforcement of restraining orders&#xD;
cannot “simply g[o] without saying.” Post, at 17, n. 16&#xD;
(STEVENS, J., dissenting). We conclude that Colorado has&#xD;
not created such an entitlement.&#xD;
                             C&#xD;
   Even if we were to think otherwise concerning the crea-&#xD;
tion of an entitlement by Colorado, it is by no means clear&#xD;
that an individual entitlement to enforcement of a re-&#xD;
straining order could constitute a “property” interest for&#xD;
purposes of the Due Process Clause. Such a right would&#xD;
not, of course, resemble any traditional conception of&#xD;
property. Although that alone does not disqualify it from&#xD;
due process protection, as Roth and its progeny show, the&#xD;
right to have a restraining order enforced does not “have&#xD;
some ascertainable monetary value,” as even our “Roth-&#xD;
type property-as-entitlement” cases have implicitly re-&#xD;
quired. Merrill, The Landscape of Constitutional Prop-&#xD;

&#xD;
erty, 86 Va. L. Rev. 885, 964 (2000).12 Perhaps most&#xD;
radically, the alleged property interest here arises inci-&#xD;
dentally, not out of some new species of government bene-&#xD;
fit or service, but out of a function that government actors&#xD;
have always performed—to wit, arresting people who they&#xD;
have probable cause to believe have committed a criminal&#xD;
offense.13&#xD;
   The indirect nature of a benefit was fatal to the due&#xD;
process claim of the nursing-home residents in O’Bannon&#xD;
v. Town Court Nursing Center, 447 U. S. 773 (1980). We&#xD;
held that, while the withdrawal of “direct benefits” (finan-&#xD;
cial payments under Medicaid for certain medical services)&#xD;
triggered due process protections, id., at 786–787, the&#xD;
same was not true for the “indirect benefit[s]” conferred on&#xD;
Medicaid patients when the Government enforced “mini-&#xD;
mum standards of care” for nursing-home facilities, id., at&#xD;
787. “[A]n indirect and incidental result of the Govern-&#xD;
ment’s enforcement action . . . does not amount to a depri-&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  12 The  dissent suggests that the interest in having a restraining order&#xD;
enforced does have an ascertainable monetary value, because one may&#xD;
“contract with a private security firm . . . to provide protection” for one’s&#xD;
family. Post, at 2, 20, and n. 18. That is, of course, not as precise as&#xD;
the analogy between public and private schooling that the dissent&#xD;
invokes. Post, at 20, n. 18. Respondent probably could have hired a&#xD;
private firm to guard her house, to prevent her husband from coming&#xD;
onto the property, and perhaps even to search for her husband after she&#xD;
discovered that her children were missing. Her alleged entitlement&#xD;
here, however, does not consist in an abstract right to “protection,” but&#xD;
(according to the dissent) in enforcement of her restraining order&#xD;
through the arrest of her husband, or the seeking of a warrant for his&#xD;
arrest, after she gave the police probable cause to believe the restrain-&#xD;
ing order had been violated. A private person would not have the&#xD;
power to arrest under those circumstances because the crime would not&#xD;
have occurred in his presence. Colo. Rev. Stat. §16–3–201 (Lexis 1999).&#xD;
And, needless to say, a private person would not have the power to&#xD;
obtain an arrest warrant.&#xD;
  13 In other contexts, we have explained that “a private citizen lacks a&#xD;
&#xD;
judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of&#xD;
another.” Linda R. S. v. Richard D., 410 U. S. 614, 619 (1973).&#xD;
                     Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                   19&#xD;
&#xD;
                          Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
vation of any interest in life, liberty, or property.” Ibid. In&#xD;
this case, as in O’Bannon, “[t]he simple distinction be-&#xD;
tween government action that directly affects a citizen’s&#xD;
legal rights . . . and action that is directed against a third&#xD;
party and affects the citizen only indirectly or incidentally,&#xD;
provides a sufficient answer to” respondent’s reliance on&#xD;
cases that found government-provided services to be enti-&#xD;
tlements. Id., at 788. The O’Bannon Court expressly&#xD;
noted, ibid., that the distinction between direct and indi-&#xD;
rect benefits distinguished Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water&#xD;
Div. v. Craft, 436 U. S. 1 (1978), one of the government-&#xD;
services cases on which the dissent relies, post, at 19.&#xD;
                               III&#xD;
   We conclude, therefore, that respondent did not, for&#xD;
purposes of the Due Process Clause, have a property in-&#xD;
terest in police enforcement of the restraining order&#xD;
against her husband. It is accordingly unnecessary to&#xD;
address the Court of Appeals’ determination (366 F. 3d, at&#xD;
1110–1117) that the town’s custom or policy prevented the&#xD;
police from giving her due process when they deprived her&#xD;
of that alleged interest. See American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co.&#xD;
v. Sullivan, 526 U. S. 40, 61 (1999).14&#xD;
   In light of today’s decision and that in DeShaney, the&#xD;
benefit that a third party may receive from having some-&#xD;
one else arrested for a crime generally does not trigger&#xD;
protections under the Due Process Clause, neither in its&#xD;
procedural nor in its “substantive” manifestations. This&#xD;
result reflects our continuing reluctance to treat the Four-&#xD;
teenth Amendment as “ ‘a font of tort law,’ ” Parratt v.&#xD;
Taylor, 451 U. S. 527, 544 (1981) (quoting Paul v. Davis, 424&#xD;
U. S., at 701), but it does not mean States are powerless to&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  14 Because we simply do not address whether the process would have&#xD;
been adequate if respondent had had a property interest, the dissent is&#xD;
correct to note that we do not “contest” the point, post, at 2. Of course&#xD;
we do not accept it either.&#xD;

Although the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment and&#xD;
the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13 (the original&#xD;
source of §1983), did not create a system by which police&#xD;
departments are generally held financially accountable for&#xD;
crimes that better policing might have prevented, the&#xD;
people of Colorado are free to craft such a system under&#xD;
state law. Cf. DeShaney, 489 U. S., at 203.15&#xD;
  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is&#xD;
                                                Reversed.&#xD;

willful and wanton.” Colo. Rev. Stat. §24–10–118(2)(a) (Lexis 1999).&#xD;
Respondent’s complaint does allege that the police officers’ actions&#xD;

&#xD;
  JUSTICE SOUTER, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,&#xD;
concurring.&#xD;
  I agree with the Court that Jessica Gonzales has shown&#xD;
no violation of an interest protected by the Fourteenth&#xD;
Amendment’s Due Process Clause, and I join the Court’s&#xD;
opinion. The Court emphasizes the traditional public&#xD;
focus of law enforcement as reason to doubt that these&#xD;
particular legal requirements to provide police services,&#xD;
however unconditional their form, presuppose enforceable&#xD;
individual rights to a certain level of police protection.&#xD;
Ante, at 15œ16. The Court also notes that the terms of the&#xD;
Colorado statute involved here recognize and preserve the&#xD;
traditional discretion afforded law enforcement officers.&#xD;
Ante, at 11–15, and n. 8. Gonzales’s claim of a property&#xD;
right thus runs up against police discretion in the face of&#xD;
an individual demand to enforce, and discretion to ignore&#xD;
an individual instruction not to enforce (because, say, of a&#xD;
domestic reconciliation); no one would argue that the&#xD;
beneficiary of a Colorado order like the one here would be&#xD;
authorized to control a court’s contempt power or order the&#xD;
police to refrain from arresting. These considerations&#xD;

&#xD;
                           SOUTER, J., concurring&#xD;
&#xD;
argue against inferring any guarantee of a level of protec-&#xD;
tion or safety that could be understood as the object of a&#xD;
“legitimate claim of entitlement,” Board of Regents of State&#xD;
Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 577 (1972), in the nature of&#xD;
property arising under Colorado law.* Consequently, the&#xD;
classic predicate for federal due process protection of&#xD;
interests under state law is missing.&#xD;
   Gonzales implicitly recognizes this, when she makes the&#xD;
following argument:&#xD;
       “Ms. Gonzales alleges that . . . she was denied the&#xD;
       process laid out in the statute. The police did not con-&#xD;
       sider her request in a timely fashion, but instead re-&#xD;
       peatedly required her to call the station over several&#xD;
       hours. The statute promised a process by which her&#xD;
       restraining order would be given vitality through&#xD;
       careful and prompt consideration of an enforcement&#xD;
       request . . . . Denial of that process drained all of the&#xD;
       value from her property interest in the restraining or-&#xD;
       der.” Brief for Respondent 10.&#xD;
The argument is unconventional because the state-law&#xD;
benefit for which it claims federal procedural protection is&#xD;
itself a variety of procedural regulation, a set of rules to be&#xD;
followed by officers exercising the State’s executive power:&#xD;
use all reasonable means to enforce, arrest upon demon-&#xD;
strable probable cause, get a warrant, and so on, see ante,&#xD;
at 2–3.&#xD;
   When her argument is understood as unconventional in&#xD;
this sense, a further reason appears for rejecting its call to&#xD;
apply Roth, a reason that would apply even if the statu-&#xD;
tory mandates to the police were absolute, leaving the&#xD;
police with no discretion when the beneficiary of a protec-&#xD;
tive order insists upon its enforcement. The Due Process&#xD;
Clause extends procedural protection to guard against&#xD;

&#xD;
unfair deprivation by state officials of substantive state-&#xD;
law property rights or entitlements; the federal process&#xD;
protects the property created by state law. But Gonzales&#xD;
claims a property interest in a state-mandated process in&#xD;
and of itself. This argument is at odds with the rule that&#xD;
“[p]rocess is not an end in itself. Its constitutional purpose&#xD;
is to protect a substantive interest to which the individual&#xD;
has a legitimate claim of entitlement.” Olim v. Wakine-&#xD;
kona, 461 U. S. 238, 250 (1983); see also Doe by Fein v.&#xD;
District of Columbia, 93 F. 3d 861, 868 (CADC 1996) (per&#xD;
curiam); Doe by Nelson v. Milwaukee County, 903 F. 2d 499,&#xD;
502–503 (CA7 1990). In putting to rest the notion that the&#xD;
scope of an otherwise discernible property interest could be&#xD;
limited by related state-law procedures, this Court observed&#xD;
that “[t]he categories of substance and procedure are dis-&#xD;
tinct. . . . ‘Property’ cannot be defined by the procedures&#xD;
provided for its deprivation.” Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. Loud-&#xD;
ermill, 470 U. S. 532, 541 (1985). Just as a State cannot&#xD;
diminish a property right, once conferred, by attaching less&#xD;
than generous procedure to its deprivation, ibid., neither&#xD;
does a State create a property right merely by ordaining&#xD;
beneficial procedure unconnected to some articulable sub-&#xD;
stantive guarantee. This is not to say that state rules of&#xD;
executive procedure may not provide significant reasons to&#xD;
infer an articulable property right meant to be protected;&#xD;
but it is to say that we have not identified property with&#xD;
procedure as such. State rules of executive procedure,&#xD;
however important, may be nothing more than rules of&#xD;
executive procedure.&#xD;
   Thus, in every instance of property recognized by this&#xD;
Court as calling for federal procedural protection, the&#xD;
property has been distinguishable from the procedural&#xD;
obligations imposed on state officials to protect it.&#xD;

property interest recognized in our cases has always ex-&#xD;
isted apart from state procedural protection before the&#xD;
Court has recognized a constitutional claim to protection&#xD;
by federal process. To accede to Gonzales’s argument&#xD;
would therefore work a sea change in the scope of federal&#xD;
due process, for she seeks federal process as a substitute&#xD;
simply for state process. (And she seeks damages under&#xD;
Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983, for denial of process to&#xD;
which she claimed a federal right.) There is no articulable&#xD;
distinction between the object of Gonzales’s asserted enti-&#xD;
tlement and the process she desires in order to protect her&#xD;
entitlement; both amount to certain steps to be taken by&#xD;
the police to protect her family and herself. Gonzales’s&#xD;
claim would thus take us beyond Roth or any other recog-&#xD;
nized theory of Fourteenth Amendment due process, by&#xD;
collapsing the distinction between property protected and&#xD;
the process that protects it, and would federalize every&#xD;
mandatory state-law direction to executive officers whose&#xD;
performance on the job can be vitally significant to indi-&#xD;
viduals affected.&#xD;
   The procedural directions involved here are just that.&#xD;
They presuppose no enforceable substantive entitlement,&#xD;

status in the name of due process.&#xD;

&#xD;
   JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins,&#xD;
dissenting.&#xD;
   The issue presented to us is much narrower than is&#xD;
suggested by the far-ranging arguments of the parties and&#xD;
their amici. Neither the tragic facts of the case, nor the&#xD;
importance of according proper deference to law enforce-&#xD;
ment professionals, should divert our attention from that&#xD;
issue. That issue is whether the restraining order entered&#xD;
by the Colorado trial court on June 4, 1999, created a&#xD;
“property” interest that is protected from arbitrary depri-&#xD;
vation by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth&#xD;
Amendment.&#xD;
   It is perfectly clear, on the one hand, that neither the&#xD;
Federal Constitution itself, nor any federal statute,&#xD;
granted respondent or her children any individual enti-&#xD;
tlement to police protection. See DeShaney v. Winnebago&#xD;
County Dept. of Social Servs., 489 U. S. 189 (1989). Nor, I&#xD;
assume, does any Colorado statute create any such enti-&#xD;
tlement for the ordinary citizen. On the other hand, it is&#xD;
equally clear that federal law imposes no impediment to&#xD;
the creation of such an entitlement by Colorado law.&#xD;
2               CASTLE ROCK v. GONZALES&#xD;
&#xD;
                    STEVENS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
Respondent certainly could have entered into a contract&#xD;
with a private security firm, obligating the firm to provide&#xD;
protection to respondent’s family; respondent’s interest in&#xD;
such a contract would unquestionably constitute “prop-&#xD;
erty” within the meaning of the Due Process Clause. If a&#xD;
Colorado statute enacted for her benefit, or a valid order&#xD;
entered by a Colorado judge, created the functional&#xD;
equivalent of such a private contract by granting respon-&#xD;
dent an entitlement to mandatory individual protection by&#xD;
the local police force, that state-created right would also&#xD;
qualify as “property” entitled to constitutional protection.&#xD;
   I do not understand the majority to rule out the forego-&#xD;
ing propositions, although it does express doubts. See&#xD;
ante, at 17 (“[I]t is by no means clear that an individual&#xD;
entitlement to enforcement of a restraining order could&#xD;
constitute a ‘property’ interest”). Moreover, the majority&#xD;
does not contest, see ante, at 18, that if respondent did&#xD;
have a cognizable property interest in this case, the depri-&#xD;
vation of that interest violated due process. As the Court&#xD;
notes, respondent has alleged that she presented the&#xD;
police with a copy of the restraining order issued by the&#xD;
Colorado court and requested that it be enforced. Ante, at&#xD;
2, n. 1. In response, she contends, the officers effectively&#xD;
ignored her. If these allegations are true, a federal stat-&#xD;
ute, Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983, provides her with&#xD;
a remedy against the petitioner, even if Colorado law does&#xD;
not. See Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. Loudermill, 470 U. S. 532&#xD;
(1985).&#xD;
   The central question in this case is therefore whether,&#xD;
as a matter of Colorado law, respondent had a right to&#xD;
police assistance comparable to the right she would have&#xD;
possessed to any other service the government or a private&#xD;
firm might have undertaken to provide. See Board of&#xD;
Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 577 (1972)&#xD;
(“Property interests, of course, are not created by the Con-&#xD;
stitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are&#xD;

&#xD;
defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from&#xD;
an independent source such as state law—rules or under-&#xD;
standings that secure certain benefits and that support&#xD;
claims of entitlement to those benefits”).&#xD;
   There was a time when our tradition of judicial restraint&#xD;
would have led this Court to defer to the judgment of more&#xD;
qualified tribunals in seeking the correct answer to that&#xD;
difficult question of Colorado law. Unfortunately, al-&#xD;
though the majority properly identifies the “central state-&#xD;
law question” in this case as “whether Colorado law gave&#xD;
respondent a right to police enforcement of the restraining&#xD;
order,” ante, at 8, it has chosen to ignore our settled prac-&#xD;
tice by providing its own answer to that question. Before&#xD;
identifying the flaws in the Court’s ruling on the merits, I&#xD;
shall briefly comment on our past practice.&#xD;
                               I&#xD;
   The majority’s decision to plunge ahead with its own&#xD;
analysis of Colorado law imprudently departs from this&#xD;
Court’s longstanding policy of paying “deference [to] the&#xD;
views of a federal court as to the law of a State within its&#xD;
jurisdiction.” Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation,&#xD;
524 U. S. 156, 167 (1998); see also Bishop v. Wood, 426&#xD;
U. S. 341, 346, and n. 10 (1976) (collecting cases). This&#xD;
policy is not only efficient, but it reflects “our belief that&#xD;
district courts and courts of appeal are better schooled in&#xD;
and more able to interpret the laws of their respective&#xD;
States.” Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491,&#xD;
500–501 (1985); Hillsborough v. Cromwell, 326 U. S. 620,&#xD;
629–630 (1946) (endorsing “great deference to the views of&#xD;
the judges of those courts ‘who are familiar with the intri-&#xD;
cacies and trends of local law and practice’ ”). Accordingly,&#xD;

which the court of appeal’s resolution of state law was&#xD;
“clearly wrong” or otherwise seriously deficient. See&#xD;

   Unfortunately, the Court does not even attempt to&#xD;
demonstrate that the six-judge en banc majority was&#xD;
“clearly wrong” in its interpretation of Colorado’s domestic&#xD;
restraining order statute; nor could such a showing be&#xD;
made. For it is certainly plausible to construe “shall use&#xD;
every reasonable means to enforce a restraining order”&#xD;
and “shall arrest,” Colo. Rev. Stat. §§18–6–803.5(3)(a)–(b)&#xD;
(Lexis 1999) (emphases added), as conveying mandatory&#xD;
directives to the police, particularly when the same stat-&#xD;
ute, at other times, tellingly employs different language&#xD;
that suggests police discretion, see §18–6–803.5(6)(a) (“A&#xD;
peace officer is authorized to use every reasonable means&#xD;
to protect . . .”; “Such peace officer may transport . . .”&#xD;
(emphases added)).1 Moreover, unlike today’s decision, the&#xD;
Court of Appeals was attentive to the legislative history of&#xD;
the statute, focusing on a statement by the statute’s spon-&#xD;
sor in the Colorado House, ante, at 10, n. 6 (quoting&#xD;
statement), which it took to “emphasiz[e] the importance&#xD;
of the police’s mandatory enforcement of domestic re-&#xD;
straining orders.” 366 F. 3d 1093, 1107 (CA10 2004) (en&#xD;
banc). Far from overlooking the traditional presumption&#xD;
of police discretion, then, the Court of Appeals’ diligent&#xD;
analysis of the statute’s text, purpose, and history led it to&#xD;
conclude that the Colorado Legislature intended precisely&#xD;
to abrogate that presumption in the specific context of&#xD;
domestic restraining orders. That conclusion is eminently&#xD;
reasonable and, I believe, worthy of our deference.2&#xD;
——————&#xD;
    1 The&#xD;
        Court of Appeals also looked to other provisions of the statute to&#xD;
inform its analysis. In particular, it reasoned that a provision that&#xD;
gave police officers qualified immunity in connection with their en-&#xD;
forcement of restraining orders, see Colo. Rev. Stat. §18–6–803.5(5)&#xD;
(Lexis 1999), supported the inference that the Colorado Legislature&#xD;
intended mandatory enforcement. See 366 F. 3d 1093, 1108 (CA10&#xD;
2004) (en banc).&#xD;

  Even if the Court had good reason to doubt the Court of&#xD;
Appeals’ determination of state law, it would, in my judg-&#xD;
ment, be a far wiser course to certify the question to the&#xD;
Colorado Supreme Court.3 Powerful considerations sup-&#xD;
port certification in this case. First, principles of federal-&#xD;
ism and comity favor giving a State’s high court the oppor-&#xD;
tunity to answer important questions of state law,&#xD;
particularly when those questions implicate uniquely local&#xD;
matters such as law enforcement and might well require&#xD;
the weighing of policy considerations for their correct&#xD;
resolution.4 See Elkins v. Moreno, 435 U. S. 647, 662,&#xD;
——————&#xD;
view, the Court of Appeals did not “draw upon a deep well of state-&#xD;
specific expertise,” ante, at 8, but rather examined the statute’s text&#xD;
and legislative history and distinguished arguably relevant Colorado&#xD;
case law. See ante, at 8–9, and n. 4. This rationale makes a mockery of&#xD;
our traditional practice, for it is precisely when there is no state law on&#xD;
point that the presumption that circuits have local expertise plays any&#xD;
useful role. When a circuit’s resolution of a novel question of state law&#xD;
is grounded on a concededly complete review of all the pertinent state-&#xD;
law materials, that decision is entitled to deference. Additionally, it&#xD;
should be noted that this is not a case in which the Court of Appeals&#xD;
and the District Court disagreed on the relevant issue of state law;&#xD;
rather, those courts disagreed only over the extent to which a probable-&#xD;
cause determination requires the exercise of discretion. Compare 366&#xD;
F. 3d, at 1105–1110, with App. to Pet. for Cert. 122a (District Court&#xD;
opinion).&#xD;

court there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the [Colorado]&#xD;

highest interest”); cf. Arizonans for Official English v.&#xD;

ond, by certifying a potentially dispositive state-law issue,&#xD;
the Court would adhere to its wise policy of avoiding the&#xD;
unnecessary adjudication of difficult questions of constitu-&#xD;

Third, certification would promote both judicial economy&#xD;

with this Court’s provisional state-law holding, our efforts&#xD;

deprived of the opportunity to have her claims heard&#xD;
under the authoritative view of Colorado law. The unique&#xD;

Court would have better access to (and greater facility with) relevant&#xD;

the domestic restraining order statute).&#xD;
   5 Citing similar considerations, the Second Circuit certified questions&#xD;

procedural due process claim involving a statute that arguably man-&#xD;
dated the removal of children upon probable cause of child abuse. See&#xD;
Sealed v. Sealed, 332 F. 3d 51 (2003). The Connecticut Supreme Court&#xD;
accepted certification and held that the provision was discretionary, not&#xD;
mandatory. See Teresa T. v. Ragaglia, 272 Conn. 734, 865 A. 2d 428&#xD;

  Three flaws in the Court’s rather superficial analysis of&#xD;
the merits highlight the unwisdom of its decision to answer&#xD;
the state-law question de novo. First, the Court places&#xD;
undue weight on the various statutes throughout the&#xD;
country that seemingly mandate police enforcement but&#xD;
are generally understood to preserve police discretion. As&#xD;
a result, the Court gives short shrift to the unique case of&#xD;
“mandatory arrest” statutes in the domestic violence&#xD;
context; States passed a wave of these statutes in the&#xD;
1980’s and 1990’s with the unmistakable goal of eliminat-&#xD;
——————&#xD;
   6 The Court is correct that I would take an “anyone-but-us approach,”&#xD;
&#xD;
ante, at 9, n. 5, to the question of who decides the issue of Colorado law&#xD;
in this case. Both options that I favor—deferring to the Circuit’s&#xD;
interpretation or, barring that, certifying to the Colorado Supreme&#xD;
Court—recognize the comparative expertise of another tribunal on&#xD;
questions of state law. And both options offer their own efficiencies. By&#xD;
contrast, the Court’s somewhat overconfident “only us” approach lacks&#xD;
any cogent justification. The fact that neither party requested certifica-&#xD;
tion certainly cannot be a sufficient reason for dismissing that option.&#xD;
As with abstention, the considerations that weigh in favor of certifica-&#xD;
tion—federal-state comity, constitutional avoidance, judicial efficiency,&#xD;
the desire to settle correctly a recurring issue of state law—transcend&#xD;
the interests of individual litigants, rendering it imprudent to cast&#xD;
them as gatekeepers to the procedure. See, e.g., Elkins v. Moreno, 435&#xD;
U. S. 647, 662 (1978) (certifying state-law issue absent a request from&#xD;
the parties); Aldrich v. Aldrich, 375 U. S. 249 (1963) (per curiam)&#xD;
(same); see also 17A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice&#xD;
and Procedure §4248, p. 176 (2d ed. 1988) (“Ordinarily a court will&#xD;

ing police discretion in this area. Second, the Court’s&#xD;
formalistic analysis fails to take seriously the fact that the&#xD;
Colorado statute at issue in this case was enacted for the&#xD;
benefit of the narrow class of persons who are beneficiaries&#xD;
of domestic restraining orders, and that the order at issue&#xD;
in this case was specifically intended to provide protection&#xD;
to respondent and her children. Finally, the Court is sim-&#xD;
ply wrong to assert that a citizen’s interest in the govern-&#xD;
ment’s commitment to provide police enforcement in certain&#xD;
defined circumstances does not resemble any “traditional&#xD;
conception of property,” ante, at 17; in fact, a citizen’s&#xD;
property interest in such a commitment is just as concrete&#xD;
and worthy of protection as her interest in any other&#xD;
important service the government or a private firm has&#xD;
undertaken to provide.&#xD;
  In 1994, the Colorado General Assembly passed omni-&#xD;
bus legislation targeting domestic violence. The part of&#xD;
the legislation at issue in this case mandates enforcement&#xD;
of a domestic restraining order upon probable cause of a&#xD;
violation, §18–6–803.5(3), while another part directs that&#xD;
police officers “shall, without undue delay, arrest” a sus-&#xD;
pect upon “probable cause to believe that a crime or of-&#xD;
fense of domestic violence has been committed,” §18–6–&#xD;
803.6(1).7 In adopting this legislation, the Colorado Gen-&#xD;

eral Assembly joined a nationwide movement of States&#xD;
that took aim at the crisis of police underenforcement in&#xD;
the domestic violence sphere by implementing “manda-&#xD;
tory arrest” statutes. The crisis of underenforcement had&#xD;
various causes, not least of which was the perception by&#xD;
police departments and police officers that domestic vio-&#xD;
lence was a private, “family” matter and that arrest was to&#xD;
be used as a last resort. Sack, Battered Women and the&#xD;

noncriminal, police assigned domestic violence calls low&#xD;
priority and often did not respond to them for several&#xD;
hours or ignored them altogether”). In response to these&#xD;
realities, and emboldened by a well-known 1984 experi-&#xD;
ment by the Minneapolis police department,8 “many states&#xD;
enacted mandatory arrest statutes under which a police&#xD;
officer must arrest an abuser when the officer has prob-&#xD;

&#xD;
bolstered in 1984 by the publication of the results of a study on manda-&#xD;
tory arrest in domestic violence cases that had been conducted in&#xD;
Minneapolis. In this study, police handled randomly assigned domestic&#xD;
violence offenders by using one of three different responses: arresting&#xD;
the offender, mediating the dispute or requiring the offender to leave&#xD;
the house for eight hours. The study concluded that in comparison with&#xD;
the other two responses, arrest had a significantly greater impact on&#xD;
reducing domestic violence recidivism. The findings from the Minnea-&#xD;
polis study were used by the U. S. Attorney General in a report issued&#xD;
in 1984 that recommended, among other things, arrest in domestic&#xD;

or that a protection order has been violated.” Develop-&#xD;
ments in the Law: Legal Responses to Domestic Violence,&#xD;
106 Harv. L. Rev. 1498, 1537 (1993). The purpose of these&#xD;
statutes was precisely to “counter police resistance to&#xD;
arrests in domestic violence cases by removing or restrict-&#xD;
ing police officer discretion; mandatory arrest policies&#xD;
would increase police response and reduce batterer recidi-&#xD;
vism.” Sack 1670.&#xD;
   Thus, when Colorado passed its statute in 1994, it joined&#xD;
the ranks of 15 States that mandated arrest for domestic&#xD;
violence offenses and 19 States that mandated arrest for&#xD;
domestic restraining order violations. See Developments in&#xD;
the Law, 106 Harv. L. Rev., at 1537, n. 68 (noting statutes&#xD;

currently have mandatory arrest statutes).9&#xD;
   Given the specific purpose of these statutes, there can&#xD;
be no doubt that the Colorado Legislature used the term&#xD;
“shall” advisedly in its domestic restraining order statute.&#xD;
While “shall” is probably best read to mean “may” in other&#xD;
Colorado statutes that seemingly mandate enforcement,&#xD;
cf. Colo. Rev. Stat. §31–4–112 (Lexis 2004) (police “shall&#xD;
suppress all riots, disturbances or breaches of the peace,&#xD;
shall apprehend all disorderly persons in the city . . .”&#xD;

mandatory-arrest statutes have been found in some States&#xD;
to be more mandatory than traditional mandatory-arrest&#xD;
statutes,” ante, at 13, but that is a serious understate-&#xD;
ment. The difference is not a matter of degree, but of&#xD;
kind. Before this wave of statutes, the legal rule was one&#xD;
of discretion; as the Court shows, the “traditional,” general&#xD;
mandatory arrest statutes have always been understood to&#xD;
be “mandatory” in name only, see ante, at 11. The innova-&#xD;
tion of the domestic violence statutes was to make police&#xD;
enforcement, not “more mandatory,” but simply manda-&#xD;
tory. If, as the Court says, the existence of a protected&#xD;
“entitlement” turns on whether “government officials may&#xD;
grant or deny it in their discretion,” ante, at 7, the new&#xD;
mandatory statutes undeniably create an entitlement to&#xD;
police enforcement of restraining orders.&#xD;
   Perhaps recognizing this point, the Court glosses over&#xD;
the dispositive question—whether the police enjoyed&#xD;
discretion to deny enforcement—and focuses on a different&#xD;
question—which “precise means of enforcement,” ante, at&#xD;
14, were called for in this case. But that question is a red&#xD;
herring. The statute directs that, upon probable cause of&#xD;
a violation, “a peace officer shall arrest, or, if an arrest&#xD;
would be impractical under the circumstances, seek a&#xD;
warrant for the arrest of a restrained person.” Colo. Rev.&#xD;
Stat. §18–6–803.5(3)(b) (Lexis 1999). Regardless of whether&#xD;
the enforcement called for in this case was arrest or the&#xD;
seeking of an arrest warrant (the answer to that question&#xD;
probably changed over the course of the night as the re-&#xD;
spondent gave the police more information about the&#xD;
husband’s whereabouts), the crucial point is that, under&#xD;
the statute, the police were required to provide enforce-&#xD;
ment; they lacked the discretion to do nothing.12 The Court&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  12 Under the Court’s reading of the statute, a police officer with prob-&#xD;
&#xD;
able cause is mandated to seek an arrest warrant if arrest is “impracti-&#xD;
cal under the circumstances,” but then enjoys unfettered discretion in&#xD;

&#xD;
suggests that the fact that “enforcement” may encompass&#xD;
different acts infects any entitlement to enforcement with&#xD;
“indeterminacy.” Ante, at 14. But this objection is also&#xD;
unfounded. Our cases have never required the object of an&#xD;
entitlement to be some mechanistic, unitary thing. Sup-&#xD;
pose a State entitled every citizen whose income was&#xD;
under a certain level to receive health care at a state&#xD;
clinic. The provision of health care is not a unitary&#xD;
thing—doctors and administrators must decide what tests&#xD;
are called for and what procedures are required, and these&#xD;
decisions often involve difficult applications of judgment.&#xD;
But it could not credibly be said that a citizen lacks an&#xD;
entitlement to health care simply because the content of&#xD;
that entitlement is not the same in every given situation.&#xD;
Similarly, the enforcement of a restraining order is not&#xD;
some amorphous, indeterminate thing. Under the statute,&#xD;
if the police have probable cause that a violation has&#xD;
occurred, enforcement consists of either making an imme-&#xD;
diate arrest or seeking a warrant and then executing an&#xD;
arrest—traditional, well-defined tasks that law enforce-&#xD;
ment officers perform every day.13&#xD;
——————&#xD;
deciding whether to execute that warrant. Ante, at 15. This is an&#xD;
unlikely reading given that the statute was motivated by a profound&#xD;
distrust of police discretion in the domestic violence context and moti-&#xD;
vated by a desire to improve the protection given to holders of domestic&#xD;
restraining orders. We do not have the benefit of an authoritative&#xD;
construction of Colorado law, but I would think that if an estranged&#xD;
husband harassed his wife in violation of a restraining order, and then&#xD;
absconded after she called the police, the statute would not only obli-&#xD;
gate the police to seek an arrest warrant, but also obligate them to&#xD;
execute it by making an arrest. In any event, under respondent’s&#xD;
allegations, by the time the police were informed of the husband’s&#xD;
whereabouts, an arrest was practical and, under the statute’s terms,&#xD;
mandatory.&#xD;
  13 The Court wonders “how the mandatory-arrest paradigm applies to&#xD;
&#xD;
cases in which the offender is not present to be arrested.” Ante, at 13.&#xD;
Again, questions as to the scope of the obligation to provide enforce-&#xD;
ment are far afield from the key issue—whether there exists an enti-&#xD;

   The Court similarly errs in speculating that the Colo-&#xD;
rado Legislature may have mandated police enforcement&#xD;
of restraining orders for “various legitimate ends other&#xD;
than the conferral of a benefit on a specific class of people,”&#xD;
ante, at 15; see also ibid. (noting that the “serving of pub-&#xD;
lic rather than private ends is the normal course of the&#xD;
criminal law”). While the Court’s concern would have&#xD;
——————&#xD;
tlement to enforcement. In any event, the Court’s speculations are off-&#xD;
base. First, this is not a case like Donaldson v. Seattle, 65 Wash. App.&#xD;
661, 831 P. 2d 1098 (1992), in which the restrained person violated the&#xD;
order and then left the scene. Here, not only did the husband violate&#xD;
the restraining order by coming within 100 yards of the family home,&#xD;
but he continued to violate the order while his abduction of the daugh-&#xD;
ters persisted. This is because the restraining order prohibited him&#xD;
from “molest[ing] or disturb[ing] the peace” of the daughters. See 366&#xD;
F. 3d, at 1143 (appendix to dissent of O’Brien, J.). Because the “scene”&#xD;
of the violation was wherever the husband was currently holding the&#xD;
daughters, this case does not implicate the question of an officer’s&#xD;
duties to arrest a person who has left the scene and is no longer in&#xD;
violation of the restraining order. Second, to the extent that arresting&#xD;
the husband was initially “impractical under the circumstances”&#xD;
because his whereabouts were unknown, the Colorado statute (unlike&#xD;
some other States’ statutes) expressly addressed that situation—it&#xD;
required the police to seek an arrest warrant. Third, the Court is&#xD;
wrong to suggest that this case falls outside the core situation that&#xD;
these types of statutes were meant to address. One of the well-known&#xD;
cases that contributed to the passage of these statutes involved facts&#xD;
similar to this case. See Sorichetti v. New York City, 65 N. Y. 2d 461,&#xD;
467, 482 N. E. 2d 70, 74 (1985) (police officers at police station essen-&#xD;
tially ignored a mother’s pleas for enforcement of a restraining order&#xD;
against an estranged husband who made threats about their 6-year-old&#xD;
daughter; hours later, as the mother persisted in her pleas, the daugh-&#xD;
ter was found mutilated, her father having attacked her with a fork&#xD;
and a knife and attempted to saw off her leg); Note, 1996 U. Ill. L. Rev.,&#xD;
at 539 (noting Sorichetti in the development of mandatory arrest&#xD;
statutes); see also Sack 1663 (citing the police’s failure to respond to&#xD;
domestic violence calls as an impetus behind mandatory arrest stat-&#xD;
utes). It would be singularly odd to suppose that in passing its sweep-&#xD;
ing omnibus domestic violence legislation, the Colorado Legislature did&#xD;
not mean to require enforcement in the case of an abduction of children&#xD;
in violation of a restraining order.&#xD;

some bite were we faced with a broadly drawn statute&#xD;
directing, for example, that the police “shall suppress all&#xD;
riots,” there is little doubt that the statute at issue in this&#xD;
case conferred a benefit “on a specific class of people”—&#xD;
namely, recipients of domestic restraining orders. Here,&#xD;
respondent applied for and was granted a restraining&#xD;
order from a Colorado trial judge, who found a risk of&#xD;
“irreparable injury” and found that “physical or emotional&#xD;
harm” would result if the husband were not excluded from&#xD;
the family home. 366 F. 3d, at 1143 (appendix to dissent&#xD;
of O’Brien, J.). As noted earlier, the restraining order&#xD;
required that the husband not “molest or disturb” the&#xD;
peace of respondent and the daughters, and it ordered&#xD;
(with limited exceptions) that the husband stay at least&#xD;
100 yards away from the family home. Ibid.14 It also&#xD;
directed the police to “use every reasonable means to&#xD;
enforce this . . . order,” and to arrest or seek a warrant&#xD;
upon probable cause of a violation. Id., at 1144. Under&#xD;
the terms of the statute, when the order issued, respon-&#xD;
dent and her daughters became “ ‘protected person[s].’ ”&#xD;
§18–6–803.5(1.5)(a) (“ ‘Protected person’ means the person&#xD;
or persons identified in the restraining order as the person&#xD;
or persons for whose benefit the restraining order was&#xD;
issued”).15 The statute criminalized the knowing violation&#xD;
of the restraining order, §18–6–803.5(1), and, as already&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  14 The order also stated: “If you violate this order thinking that the&#xD;
&#xD;
other party or child named in this order has given you permission, you&#xD;
are wrong, and can be arrested and prosecuted. The terms of this order&#xD;
cannot be changed by agreement of the other party or the child(ren),&#xD;
only the court can change this order.” 366 F. 3d, at 1144 (appendix to&#xD;
dissent of O’Brien, J.).&#xD;
  15 A concern for the “ ‘protected person’ ” pervades the statute. For&#xD;
&#xD;
example, the statute provides that a “peace officer may transport, or&#xD;
obtain transportation for, the alleged victim to shelter. Upon the&#xD;
request of the protected person, the peace officer may also transport the&#xD;
minor child of the protected person, who is not an emancipated minor,&#xD;
to the same shelter . . . .” §18–6–803.5(6)(a).&#xD;

&#xD;
discussed, the statute (as well as the order itself) man-&#xD;
dated police enforcement, §§18–6–803.5(3)(a)–(b).16&#xD;
    Because the statute’s guarantee of police enforcement is&#xD;
triggered by, and operates only in reference to, a judge’s&#xD;
granting of a restraining order in favor of an identified&#xD;
“ ‘protected person,’ ” there is simply no room to suggest&#xD;
that such a person has received merely an “ ‘incidental’ ” or&#xD;
“ ‘indirect’ ” benefit, see ante, at 18. As one state court put&#xD;
it, domestic restraining order statutes “identify with preci-&#xD;
sion when, to whom, and under what circumstances police&#xD;
protection must be afforded. The legislative purpose in&#xD;
requiring the police to enforce individual restraining&#xD;
orders clearly is to protect the named persons for whose&#xD;
protection the order is issued, not to protect the commu-&#xD;
nity at large by general law enforcement activity.” Near-&#xD;
ing, 295 Ore., at 712, 670 P. 2d, at 143.17 Not only does&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  16 I find it neither surprising nor telling, cf. ante, at 15, that the stat-&#xD;
&#xD;
ute requires the restraining order to contain, “in capital letters and&#xD;
bold print,” a “notice” informing protected persons that they can de-&#xD;
mand or request, respectively, civil and criminal contempt proceedings.&#xD;
§18–6–803.5(7). While the legislature may have thought that these&#xD;
legal remedies were not popularly understood, a person’s right to&#xD;
“demand” or “request” police enforcement of a restraining order simply&#xD;
goes without saying given the nature of the order and its language.&#xD;
Indeed, for a holder of a restraining order who has read the order’s&#xD;
emphatic language, it would likely come as quite a shock to learn that&#xD;
she has no right to demand enforcement in the event of a violation. To&#xD;
suggest that a protected person has no such right would posit a lacuna&#xD;
between a protected person’s rights and an officer’s duties—a result&#xD;
that would be hard to reconcile with the Colorado Legislature’s dual&#xD;
goals of putting an end to police indifference and empowering potential&#xD;
victims of domestic abuse.&#xD;

the Court’s doubt about whether Colorado’s statute cre-&#xD;

seriously the purpose and nature of restraining orders, but&#xD;
it fails to account for the decisions by other state courts,&#xD;
see supra at 11–12, that recognize that such statutes and&#xD;
restraining orders create individual rights to police action.&#xD;
                              IV&#xD;
    Given that Colorado law has quite clearly eliminated&#xD;
the police’s discretion to deny enforcement, respondent is&#xD;
correct that she had much more than a “unilateral expec-&#xD;
tation” that the restraining order would be enforced;&#xD;
rather, she had a “legitimate claim of entitlement” to&#xD;
enforcement. Roth, 408 U. S., at 577. Recognizing respon-&#xD;
dent’s property interest in the enforcement of her restrain-&#xD;
ing order is fully consistent with our precedent. This&#xD;
Court has “made clear that the property interests pro-&#xD;
tected by procedural due process extend well beyond ac-&#xD;
tual ownership of real estate, chattels, or money.” Id., at&#xD;
571–572. The “types of interests protected as ‘property’&#xD;
are varied and, as often as not, intangible, ‘relating to the&#xD;

   Police enforcement of a restraining order is a govern-&#xD;
ment service that is no less concrete and no less valuable&#xD;
than other government services, such as education.18 The&#xD;
relative novelty of recognizing this type of property inter-&#xD;

violence statutes creating a mandatory arrest duty; before&#xD;
this innovation, the unfettered discretion that character-&#xD;

claim of entitlement” to this service. Novel or not, respon-&#xD;

&#xD;
Center, 447 U. S. 773 (1980), in explaining why it is “by no means&#xD;
clear that an individual entitlement to enforcement of a restraining&#xD;
order could constitute a ‘property’ interest for purposes of the Due&#xD;
Process Clause.” Ante, at 17. In O’Bannon, the question was essen-&#xD;
tially whether certain regulations provided nursing-home residents&#xD;
with an entitlement to continued residence in the home of their choice.&#xD;
447 U. S., at 785. The Court concluded that the regulations created no&#xD;
such entitlement, but there was no suggestion that Congress could not&#xD;
create one if it wanted to. In other words, O’Bannon did not address a&#xD;
situation in which the underlying law created an entitlement, but the&#xD;
Court nevertheless refused to treat that entitlement as a property&#xD;
interest within the meaning of the Due Process Clause.&#xD;

beneficiaries, and respondent reasonably relied on that&#xD;
guarantee. As we observed in Roth, “[i]t is a purpose of&#xD;
the ancient institution of property to protect those claims&#xD;
upon which people rely in their daily lives, reliance that&#xD;
must not be arbitrarily undermined.” 408 U. S., at 577.&#xD;
Surely, if respondent had contracted with a private secu-&#xD;
rity firm to provide her and her daughters with protection&#xD;
from her husband, it would be apparent that she pos-&#xD;
sessed a property interest in such a contract. Here, Colo-&#xD;
rado undertook a comparable obligation, and respondent—&#xD;
with restraining order in hand—justifiably relied on that&#xD;
undertaking. Respondent’s claim of entitlement to this&#xD;
promised service is no less legitimate than the other&#xD;
claims our cases have upheld, and no less concrete than a&#xD;
hypothetical agreement with a private firm.19 The fact&#xD;
that it is based on a statutory enactment and a judicial&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  19 As the analogy to a private security contract demonstrates, a per-&#xD;
&#xD;
son’s interest in police enforcement has “ ‘some ascertainable monetary&#xD;
value,’ ” ante, at 17. Cf. Merrill, The Landscape of Constitutional&#xD;
Property, 86 Va. L. Rev. 885, 964, n. 289 (2000) (remarking, with&#xD;
regard to the property interest recognized in Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S.&#xD;
565 (1975), that “any parent who has contemplated sending their&#xD;
children to private schools knows that public schooling has a monetary&#xD;
value”). And while the analogy to a private security contract need not&#xD;
be precise to be useful, I would point out that the Court is likely incor-&#xD;
rect in stating that private security guards could not have arrested the&#xD;
husband under the circumstances, see ante, at 17, n. 10. Because the&#xD;
husband’s ongoing abduction of the daughters would constitute a&#xD;
knowing violation of the restraining order, see n. 13, supra, and there-&#xD;
fore a crime under the statute, see §18–6–803.5(1), a private person&#xD;
who was at the scene and aware of the circumstances of the abduction&#xD;
would have authority to arrest. See §16–3–201 (“A person who is not a&#xD;
peace officer may arrest another person when any crime has been or is&#xD;
being committed by the arrested person in the presence of the person&#xD;
making the arrest”). Our cases, of course, have never recognized any&#xD;
requirement that a property interest possess “ ‘some ascertainable&#xD;
monetary value.’ ” Regardless, I would assume that respondent would&#xD;
have paid the police to arrest her husband if that had been possible; at&#xD;
the very least, the entitlement has a monetary value in that sense.&#xD;

  20 According to JUSTICE SOUTER, respondent has asserted a property&#xD;
&#xD;
interest in merely a “state-mandated process,” ante, at 3 (opinion&#xD;
concurring in part and concurring in judgment), rather than in a state-&#xD;
mandated “substantive guarantee,” ibid. This misunderstands respon-&#xD;
dent’s claim. Putting aside the inartful passage of respondent’s brief&#xD;
that JUSTICE SOUTER relies upon, ante, at 2, it is clear that respondent&#xD;
is in fact asserting a substantive interest in the “enforcement of the&#xD;
restraining order.” Brief for Respondent 10. Enforcement of a restrain-&#xD;
ing order is a tangible, substantive act. If an estranged husband&#xD;
violates a restraining order by abducting children, and the police&#xD;
succeed in enforcing the order, the person holding the restraining order&#xD;
has undeniably just received a substantive benefit. As in other proce-&#xD;
dural due process cases, respondent is arguing that the police officers&#xD;
failed to follow fair procedures in ascertaining whether the statutory&#xD;
criteria that trigger their obligation to provide enforcement—i.e., an&#xD;
outstanding order plus probable cause that it is being violated—were&#xD;
satisfied in her case. Cf. Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 266–267 (1978)&#xD;
(discussing analytic difference between the denial of fair process and&#xD;
the denial of the substantive benefit itself). It is JUSTICE SOUTER, not&#xD;
respondent, who makes the mistake of “collapsing the distinction&#xD;
between property protected and the process that protects it,” ante, at 4.&#xD;
  JUSTICE SOUTER also errs in suggesting that respondent cannot have&#xD;
a property interest in enforcement because she would not be authorized&#xD;
to instruct the police to refrain from enforcement in the event of a&#xD;
violation. Ante, at 1. The right to insist on the provision of a service is&#xD;
separate from the right to refuse the service. For example, compulsory&#xD;
attendance laws deny minors the right to refuse to attend school.&#xD;
Nevertheless, we have recognized that minors have a property interest&#xD;
in public education and that school officials must therefore follow fair&#xD;
procedures when they seek to deprive minors of this valuable benefit&#xD;
through suspension. See Goss, 419 U. S. 565. In the end, JUSTICE&#xD;
SOUTER overlooks the core purpose of procedural due process—ensuring&#xD;
that a citizen’s reasonable reliance is not frustrated by arbitrary&#xD;
government action.&#xD;
