       CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MONTANA&#xD;
&#xD;
  No. 10–218.     Argued December 7, 2011—Decided February 22, 2012&#xD;
Petitioner PPL Montana, LLC (PPL), owns and operates hydroelectric&#xD;
  facilities in Montana. Ten of its facilities are located on riverbeds&#xD;
  underlying segments of the Missouri, Madison, and Clark Fork Riv-&#xD;
  ers. Five hydroelectric dams on the Upper Missouri River are along&#xD;
  the Great Falls reach, including on the three tallest waterfalls; and&#xD;
  PPL’s two other dams on that river are in canyons on the Stubbs Fer-&#xD;
  ry stretch. These, together with two dams located in steep canyons&#xD;
  on the Madison River, are called the Missouri-Madison project. The&#xD;
  Thompson Falls project is a facility on the Clark Fork River. Both&#xD;
  projects are licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.&#xD;
  PPL’s facilities have existed for many decades, some for over a centu-&#xD;
  ry. Until recently, Montana, though aware of the projects’ existence,&#xD;
  sought no rent for use of the riverbeds. Instead, the understanding of&#xD;
  PPL and the United States is that PPL has paid rents to the United&#xD;
  States. In 2003, parents of Montana schoolchildren filed a federal&#xD;
  suit, claiming that PPL’s facilities were on riverbeds that were state&#xD;
  owned and part of Montana’s school trust lands. The State joined the&#xD;
  suit and, for the first time, sought rents from PPL for its use of the&#xD;
  riverbeds. That case was dismissed, and PPL and other power com-&#xD;
  panies filed a state-court suit, claiming that Montana was barred&#xD;
  from seeking compensation for PPL’s riverbed use. Montana coun-&#xD;
  terclaimed, contending that under the equal-footing doctrine it owns&#xD;
  the riverbeds and can charge rent for their use. The trial court&#xD;
  granted Montana summary judgment as to navigability for purposes&#xD;
  of determining riverbed title and ordered PPL to pay Montana $41&#xD;
  million in rent for riverbed use between 2000 and 2007. The Mon-&#xD;
  tana Supreme Court affirmed. Adopting a liberal construction of the&#xD;
  navigability test, it discounted this Court’s approach of considering&#xD;
  the navigability of particular river segments for purposes of deter-&#xD;

&#xD;
    mining whether a State acquired title to the riverbeds underlying&#xD;
    those segments at the time of statehood. Instead, the Montana court&#xD;
    declared the river stretches in question to be short interruptions of&#xD;
    navigability that were insufficient as a matter of law to find nonnavi-&#xD;
    gability, since traffic had circumvented those stretches by portage.&#xD;
    Based on evidence of present-day, recreational use of the Madison&#xD;
    River, the court found that river navigable as a matter of law at the&#xD;
    time of statehood.&#xD;
Held: The Montana Supreme Court’s ruling that Montana owns and&#xD;
 may charge for use of the riverbeds at issue was based on an infirm&#xD;
 legal understanding of this Court’s rules of navigability for title un-&#xD;
 der the equal-footing doctrine. Pp. 10–26.&#xD;
    (a) The rule that the States, in their capacity as sovereigns, hold&#xD;
 “title in the soil of rivers really navigable,” Shively v. Bowlby, 152&#xD;
 U. S. 1, 31, has federal constitutional significance under the equal-&#xD;
 footing doctrine. Pursuant to that doctrine, upon its date of state-&#xD;
 hood, a State gains title within its borders to the beds of waters then&#xD;
 navigable. It may allocate and govern those lands according to state&#xD;
 law subject only to the United States’ power “to control such waters&#xD;
 for purposes of navigation in interstate and foreign commerce.” Unit-&#xD;
 ed States v. Oregon, 295 U. S. 1, 14. The United States retains title&#xD;
 vested in it before statehood to land beneath waters not then naviga-&#xD;
 ble. To be navigable for purposes of title under the equal-footing doc-&#xD;
 trine, rivers must be “navigable in fact,” meaning “they are used, or&#xD;
 are susceptible of being used, . . . as highways for commerce, over&#xD;
 which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary&#xD;
 modes of trade and travel on water.” The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557,&#xD;
 563. This formulation has been used to determine questions of wa-&#xD;
 terbed title under the equal-footing doctrine. See United States v.&#xD;
 Utah, 283 U. S. 64, 76. Pp. 10–14.&#xD;
    (b) The Montana Supreme Court erred in its treatment of the ques-&#xD;
 tion of river segments and portage. To determine riverbed title under&#xD;
 the equal-footing doctrine, this Court considers the river on a seg-&#xD;
 ment-by-segment basis to assess whether the segment of the river,&#xD;
 under which the riverbed in dispute lies, is navigable or not. See,&#xD;
 e.g., Utah, supra, at 77. The State Supreme Court erred in discount-&#xD;
 ing this well-settled approach. A key justification for sovereign own-&#xD;
 ership of navigable riverbeds is that a contrary rule would allow pri-&#xD;
 vate riverbed owners to erect improvements on the riverbeds that&#xD;
 could interfere with the public’s right to use the waters as a highway&#xD;
 for commerce. Because commerce could not have occurred on seg-&#xD;
 ments nonnavigable at the time of statehood, there is no reason to&#xD;
 deem those segments owned by the State under the equal-footing&#xD;
 doctrine. Practical considerations also support segmentation. Physi-&#xD;
                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3&#xD;
&#xD;
                              Syllabus&#xD;
&#xD;
cal conditions affecting navigability vary over the length of a river&#xD;
and provide a means to determine appropriate start points and end&#xD;
points for disputed segments. A segment approach is also consistent&#xD;
with the manner in which private parties seek to establish riverbed&#xD;
title. Montana cannot suggest that segmentation is inadministrable&#xD;
when the state courts managed to apportion the underlying riverbeds&#xD;
for purposes of determining their value and PPL’s corresponding&#xD;
rents. The State Supreme Court’s view that the segment-by-segment&#xD;
approach does not apply to short interruptions of navigability is not&#xD;
supported by this Court’s Utah decision. Even if the law might find&#xD;
some nonnavigable segments so minimal that they merit treatment&#xD;
as part of a longer, navigable reach, it is doubtful that the segments&#xD;
in this case would meet that standard. Applying its “short interrup-&#xD;
tions” approach, the State Supreme Court found the Great Falls&#xD;
reach navigable because it could be managed by way of land route&#xD;
portage, as done by Lewis and Clark. But a portage of even one day&#xD;
would demonstrate the need to bypass a nonnavigable river segment.&#xD;
Thus, the State Supreme Court was wrong to conclude, with respect&#xD;
to the Great Falls reach and other disputed stretches, that portages&#xD;
were insufficient to defeat a navigability finding. In most cases, they&#xD;
are, because they require transportation over land rather than over&#xD;
the water. This is the case at least as to the Great Falls reach. In&#xD;
reaching a contrary conclusion, the State Supreme Court misapplied&#xD;
The Montello, 20 Wall. 430. There, portage was considered in deter-&#xD;
mining whether a river was part of a channel of interstate commerce&#xD;
for federal regulatory purposes. The Montello does not control the&#xD;
outcome where the quite different concerns of the riverbed title con-&#xD;
text apply. Portages may defeat navigability for title purposes, and&#xD;
do so with respect to the Great Falls reach. Montana does not dis-&#xD;
pute that overland portage was necessary to traverse that reach, and&#xD;
the trial court noted the waterfalls had never been navigated. The&#xD;
Great Falls reach, at least from the head of the first waterfall to the&#xD;
foot of the last, is not navigable for purposes of riverbed title under&#xD;
the equal-footing doctrine. There is also a significant likelihood that&#xD;
some of the other river stretches in dispute fail this federal navigabil-&#xD;
ity test. The ultimate decision as to these other disputed river&#xD;
stretches is to be determined, in the first instance, by the Montana&#xD;
courts on remand, which should assess the relevant evidence in light&#xD;
of the principles discussed here. Pp. 14–21.&#xD;
   (c) The Montana Supreme Court further erred as a matter of law in&#xD;
relying on evidence of present-day, primarily recreational use of the&#xD;
Madison River. Navigability must be assessed as of the time of&#xD;
statehood, and it concerns a river’s usefulness for “ ‘trade and trav-&#xD;
el.’ ” Utah, 283 U. S., at 75–76. River segments are navigable if they&#xD;

&#xD;
    “ ‘[were]’ ” used and if they “ ‘[were] susceptible of being used’ ” as&#xD;
    highways of commerce at the time of statehood. Id., at 76. Evidence&#xD;
    of recreational use and poststatehood evidence may bear on suscepti-&#xD;
    bility of commercial use at the time of statehood. See id., at 82–83.&#xD;
    In order for present-day use to have a bearing on navigability at&#xD;
    statehood, (1) the watercraft must be meaningfully similar to those in&#xD;
    customary use for trade and travel at the time of statehood, and&#xD;
    (2) the river’s poststatehood condition may not be materially different&#xD;
    from its physical condition at statehood. The State Supreme Court&#xD;
    offered no indication that it made these necessary findings. Pp. 21–&#xD;
    24.&#xD;
        (d) Because this analysis is sufficient to require reversal here, the&#xD;
    Court declines to decide whether the State Supreme Court also erred&#xD;
    as to the burden of proof regarding navigability. P. 24.&#xD;
        (e) Montana’s suggestion that denying the State title to the disput-&#xD;
    ed riverbeds will undermine the public trust doctrine—which con-&#xD;
    cerns public access to the waters above those beds for navigation,&#xD;
    fishing, and other recreational uses—underscores its misapprehen-&#xD;
    sion of the equal-footing and public trust doctrines. Unlike the equal-&#xD;
    footing doctrine, which is the constitutional foundation for the navi-&#xD;
    gability rule of riverbed title, the scope of the public trust over waters&#xD;
    within the State’s borders is a matter of state law, subject to federal&#xD;
    regulatory power. Pp. 24–25.&#xD;
        (f) This Court does not reach the question whether, by virtue of&#xD;
    Montana’s sovereignty, neither laches nor estoppel could apply to bar&#xD;
    the State’s claim. Still, the reliance by PPL and its predecessors in ti-&#xD;
    tle on the State’s long failure to assert title to the riverbeds is some&#xD;
    evidence supporting the conclusion that the river segments over&#xD;
    those beds were nonnavigable for purposes of the equal-footing doc-&#xD;
    trine. Pp. 25–26.&#xD;

                      MONTANA&#xD;
&#xD;
                              [February 22, 2012]&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.&#xD;
   This case concerns three rivers which flow through&#xD;
Montana and then beyond its borders. The question is&#xD;
whether discrete, identifiable segments of these rivers in&#xD;
Montana were nonnavigable, as federal law defines that&#xD;
concept for purposes of determining whether the State&#xD;
acquired title to the riverbeds underlying those segments,&#xD;
when the State entered the Union in 1889. Montana&#xD;
contends that the rivers must be found navigable at the&#xD;
disputed locations. From this premise, the State asserts&#xD;
that in 1889 it gained title to the disputed riverbeds under&#xD;
the constitutional equal-footing doctrine. Based on its&#xD;
title claims, Montana sought compensation from PPL&#xD;
Montana, LLC, a power company, for its use of the riv­&#xD;
erbeds for hydroelectric projects. The Montana courts&#xD;
granted summary judgment on title to Montana, awarding&#xD;
it $41 million in rent for the riverbeds for the period from&#xD;
2000 to 2007 alone. That judgment must be reversed.&#xD;
                             I&#xD;
  The three rivers in question are the Missouri River, the&#xD;
Madison River, and the Clark Fork River. The Missouri&#xD;
and the Madison are on the eastern side of the Continen­&#xD;

tal Divide. The Madison flows into the Missouri, which&#xD;
then continues at length to its junction with the Missis­&#xD;
sippi River. The Clark Fork River is on the western side&#xD;
of the Continental Divide. Its waters join the Columbia&#xD;
River system that flows into the Pacific Ocean. Each river&#xD;
shall be described in somewhat more detail.&#xD;
                             A&#xD;
   The Missouri River originates in Montana and traverses&#xD;
seven States before a point just north of St. Louis where&#xD;
it joins the Mississippi. 19 Encyclopedia Americana 270&#xD;
(int’l ed. 2006). If considered with the continuous path&#xD;
formed by certain streams that provide the Missouri Riv­&#xD;
er’s headwaters, the Missouri is over 2,500 miles long, the&#xD;
longest river in the United States. Ibid. The Missouri&#xD;
River’s basin (the land area drained by the river) is the&#xD;
second largest in the Nation, surpassed only by the Mis­&#xD;
sissippi River basin of which it is a part. Rivers of North&#xD;
America 427 (A. Benke &amp; C. Cushing eds. 2005) (hereinaf­&#xD;
ter Rivers of North America). As a historical matter, the&#xD;
river shifted and flooded often, and contained many sand­&#xD;
bars, islands, and unstable banks. Id., at 432–433. The&#xD;
river was once described as one of the most “variable&#xD;
beings in creation,” as “inconstant [as] the action of the&#xD;
jury,” Sioux City Register (Mar. 28, 1868); and its high&#xD;
quantity of downstream sediment flow spawned its nick­&#xD;
name, the “Big Muddy,” Rivers of North America 433.&#xD;
   The upstream part of the Missouri River in Montana,&#xD;
known as the Upper Missouri River, is better charac­&#xD;
terized as rocky rather than muddy. While one usually&#xD;
thinks of the Missouri River as flowing generally south, as&#xD;
indeed it does beginning in North Dakota, the Upper&#xD;
Missouri in Montana flows north from its principal head­&#xD;
waters at Three Forks, which is located about 4,000 feet&#xD;
above sea level in the Rocky Mountain area of southwest­&#xD;
ern Montana. It descends through scenic mountain ter­&#xD;

cascading over a roughly 10-mile stretch of cataracts and&#xD;
rapids over which the river drops more than 400 feet; and&#xD;
courses swiftly to Fort Benton, a 19th-century fur trading&#xD;
post, before progressing farther east into North Dakota&#xD;

inafter Columbia Gazetteer); F. Warner, Montana and the&#xD;
Northwest Territory 75 (1879). In 1891, just after Mon­&#xD;
tana became a State, the Upper Missouri River above Fort&#xD;
Benton was “seriously obstructed by numerous rapids and&#xD;
rocks,” and the 168-mile portion flowing eastward “[f]rom&#xD;
Fort Benton to Carroll, Mont., [was] called the rocky riv­&#xD;

   The Great Falls exemplify the rocky, rapid character&#xD;
of the Upper Missouri. They consist of five cascade-like&#xD;
waterfalls located over a stretch of the Upper Missouri&#xD;
leading downstream from the city of Great Falls in mid­&#xD;
western Montana. The waterfall farthest downstream,&#xD;
and the one first encountered by Meriwether Lewis and&#xD;
William Clark when they led their remarkable expedition&#xD;
through the American West in 1805, is the eponymous&#xD;
“Great Falls,” the tallest of the five falls at 87 feet. W.&#xD;
Clark, Dear Brother: Letters of William Clark to Jonathan&#xD;
Clark 109, n. 5 (J. Holmberg ed. 2002) (hereinafter Dear&#xD;

grand specticle”:&#xD;
    “[T]he whole body of water passes with incredible&#xD;
    swiftness. . . . over a precipice of at least eighty feet&#xD;
    . . . . [T]he irregular and somewhat projecting rocks&#xD;

    below receives the water . . . and brakes it into a per­&#xD;
    fect white foam which assumes a thousand forms in&#xD;
    a moment sometimes flying up in jets . . . [that] are&#xD;
    scarcely formed before large roling bodies of the same&#xD;
    beaten and foaming water is thrown over and conceals&#xD;
    them. . . . [T]he [rainbow] reflection of the sun on the&#xD;
    sprey or mist . . . adds not a little to the beauty of this&#xD;
    majestically grand senery.” The Lewis and Clark&#xD;
    Journals: An American Epic of Discovery 129 (G.&#xD;

    nals); The Journals of Lewis and Clark 136–138 (B.&#xD;
    DeVoto ed. 1981).&#xD;
  If one proceeds alongside the river upstream from Great&#xD;
Falls, as Lewis did in scouting the river for the expedition,&#xD;
the other four falls in order are “Crooked Falls” (19 feet&#xD;
high); “Rainbow Falls” (48 feet), which Lewis called “one of&#xD;
the most bea[u]tifull objects in nature”; “Colter Falls” (7&#xD;
feet), and “Black Eagle Falls” (26 feet). See Lewis and&#xD;
Clark Journals 131–132; Dear Brother 109, n. 5; P. Cut-&#xD;
right, Lewis &amp; Clark: Pioneering Naturalists 154–156&#xD;
(2003). Despite the falls’ beauty, Lewis could see that&#xD;
their steep cliffs and swift waters would impede progress&#xD;
on the river, which had been the expedition’s upstream&#xD;
course for so many months. The party proceeded over a&#xD;
more circuitous land route by means of portage, circum­&#xD;
venting the Great Falls and their surrounding reach of&#xD;
river before returning to travel upon the river about a&#xD;
month later. See Lewis and Clark Journals 126–152.&#xD;
  The Upper Missouri River, both around and further&#xD;
upstream of the Great Falls, shares the precipitous and&#xD;
fast-moving character of the falls themselves. As it moves&#xD;
downstream over the Great Falls reach, a 17-mile stretch&#xD;
that begins somewhat above the head of Black Eagle Falls,&#xD;
the river quickly descends about 520 feet in elevation, see&#xD;

the water was so swift over the area that buffalo were&#xD;
swept over the cataracts in “considerable quantities” and&#xD;
were “instantly crushed.” Lewis and Clark Journals 136–&#xD;

  The second river to be considered is the Madison, one&#xD;

  The third river at issue in this case is the Clark Fork.&#xD;
That river, which consists in large part of “long, narrow&#xD;
streams confined by mountainous terrain,” rises at an ele-&#xD;
vation of about 5,000 feet in the Silver Bow Mountains&#xD;
of southwestern Montana. 3 Encyclopaedia Britannica&#xD;

&amp; F. Henshaw, Surface Water Supply of the United&#xD;
States, 1907–8, Water-Supply Paper 252, pp. 81–82&#xD;
(1910). The river flows northward for about 40 miles;&#xD;
turns northwest for a stretch; then turns abruptly north­&#xD;
east for a short stint, by which time it has descended&#xD;
nearly 2,500 feet in altitude. It then resumes a north­&#xD;
westward course until it empties into Lake Pend Oreille in&#xD;
northern Idaho, out of which flows a tributary to the Co­&#xD;
lumbia River of the Pacific Northwest. Ibid.; 1 Columbia&#xD;
Gazetteer 816. The Clark Fork is “one of the wildest and&#xD;
most picturesque streams in the West,” marked by “many&#xD;
waterfalls and boxed gorges.” Federal Writers’ Projects of&#xD;

  Lewis and Clark knew of the Clark Fork River but did&#xD;
not try to navigate it, in part because the absence of salm­&#xD;
on in one of its tributaries made Lewis believe “ ‘there&#xD;
must be a considerable fall in [the river] below.’ ” H. Fritz,&#xD;
The Lewis and Clark Expedition 38–39 (2004). This was&#xD;
correct, for shortly before the Clark Fork exits to Idaho&#xD;
from the northwest corner of Montana, “the waters of the&#xD;
river dash madly along their rocky bed,” dropping over 30&#xD;
feet in a half-mile as they rush over falls and rapids in­&#xD;
cluding a “foaming waterfall” now known as Thompson&#xD;
Falls. O. Rand, A Vacation Excursion: From Massachu­&#xD;

   Petitioner PPL Montana, LLC (PPL), owns and operates&#xD;
hydroelectric facilities that serve Montana residents and&#xD;
businesses. Ten of its facilities are built upon riverbeds&#xD;
underlying segments of the Upper Missouri, Madison, and&#xD;
Clark Fork Rivers. It is these beds to which title is&#xD;
disputed.&#xD;
   On the Upper Missouri River, PPL has seven hydroelec­&#xD;
tric dams. Five of them are along the Great Falls reach,&#xD;
including on the three tallest falls; and the other two are&#xD;
in canyons upstream on the Stubbs Ferry stretch. See K.&#xD;
Robison, Cascade County and Great Falls 56 (2011); Aar­&#xD;
stad et al., supra, at 125, 119, 145–146. On the Madison&#xD;
River, two hydroelectric dams are located in steep can­&#xD;
yons. On the Clark Fork River, a hydroelectric facility is&#xD;
constructed on the Thompson Falls.&#xD;
   The dams on the Upper Missouri and Madison are&#xD;
called the Missouri-Madison project. The Thompson Falls&#xD;
facility is called the Thompson Falls project. Both projects&#xD;
are licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis­&#xD;
sion. PPL acquired them in 1999 from its predecessor, the&#xD;
Montana Power Company. 355 Mont., at 405–406, 229&#xD;
P. 3d, at 426.&#xD;
   PPL’s power facilities have existed at their locations for&#xD;
many decades, some for over a century. See Robison,&#xD;
supra, at 40 (Black Eagle Falls dam constructed by 1891).&#xD;
Until recently, these facilities were operated without title­&#xD;
based objection by the State of Montana. The State was&#xD;
well aware of the facilities’ existence on the riverbeds—&#xD;
indeed, various Montana state agencies had participated&#xD;
in federal licensing proceedings for these hydroelectric&#xD;
projects. See, e.g., Montana Power Co., 8 F. P. C. 751, 752&#xD;
(1949) (Thompson Falls project); Montana Power Co., 27&#xD;

   In 2003, parents of Montana schoolchildren sued PPL in&#xD;

that were state owned and part of Montana’s school trust&#xD;
lands. 355 Mont., at 406, 229 P. 3d, at 426. Prompted&#xD;
by the litigation, the State joined the lawsuit, for the first&#xD;
time seeking rents for PPL’s riverbed use. The case was&#xD;
dismissed in September 2005 for lack of diversity juris-&#xD;
diction. Dolan v. PPL Montana, LLC, No. 9:03–cv–167&#xD;

   PPL and two other power companies sued the State of&#xD;
Montana in the First Judicial District Court of Montana,&#xD;
arguing that the State was barred from seeking compensa­&#xD;
tion for use of the riverbeds. 355 Mont., at 407–408, 229&#xD;
P. 3d, at 427–428. By counterclaim, the State sought a&#xD;
declaration that under the equal-footing doctrine it owns&#xD;
the riverbeds used by PPL and can charge rent for their&#xD;
use. Id., at 408, 229 P. 3d, at 428. The Montana trial&#xD;

461; id., at 462, 229 P. 3d, at 461 (dissenting opinion).&#xD;
The court reasoned from the background principle that&#xD;
“navigability for title purposes is very liberally construed.”&#xD;
Id., at 438, 229 P. 3d, at 446. It dismissed as having&#xD;
“limited applicability” this Court’s approach of assessing&#xD;
the navigability of the disputed segment of the river ra­&#xD;
ther than the river as a whole. Id., at 441–442, 229 P. 3d,&#xD;
at 448–449. The Montana court accepted that certain&#xD;
relevant stretches of the rivers were not navigable but&#xD;
declared them “merely short interruptions” insufficient as&#xD;
a matter of law to find nonnavigability, since traffic had&#xD;
circumvented those stretches by overland portage. Id.,&#xD;
at 438, 442, 229 P. 3d, at 446, 449. Placing extensive&#xD;
reliance upon evidence of present-day use of the Madison&#xD;
River, the court found that river navigable as a matter of&#xD;
law at the time of statehood. Id., at 439, 229 P. 3d, at 447.&#xD;
   Justice Rice dissented. Id., at 462, 229 P. 3d, at 461.&#xD;
He stated that “courts are not to assume an entire river is&#xD;
navigable merely because certain reaches of the river are&#xD;
navigable.” Id., at 464, 229 P. 3d, at 462. The majority&#xD;
erred, he wrote, in rejecting the “section-by-section ap­&#xD;
proach” and “declaring, as a matter of law, that the&#xD;
reaches claimed by PPL to be non-navigable are simply too&#xD;
‘short’ to matter,” when in fact PPL’s evidence showed the&#xD;
“disputed reaches of the rivers were, at the time of state­&#xD;
hood, non-navigable.” Id., at 463–466, 476–477, 229 P. 3d,&#xD;
at 462–464, 470.&#xD;

&#xD;
   PPL contends the opinion of the Montana Supreme&#xD;
Court is flawed in three respects: first, the court’s failure&#xD;
to consider with care the navigability of the particular&#xD;
river segments to which title is disputed, and its disregard&#xD;
of the necessary overland portage around some of those&#xD;
segments; second, its misplaced reliance upon evidence of&#xD;
present-day, recreational use; and third, what the state&#xD;
court itself called its liberal construction of the navigabil­&#xD;
ity test, which did not place the burden of proof upon&#xD;
the State to show navigability. Brief for Petitioner 26. The&#xD;
United States as amicus is in substantial agreement with&#xD;
PPL’s arguments, although it offers a more extended dis­&#xD;
cussion with respect to evidence of present-day, recrea­&#xD;
tional use. Brief for United States 27–33.&#xD;
   It is appropriate to begin the analysis by discussing the&#xD;
legal principles that control the case.&#xD;
                             B&#xD;
  The rule that the States, in their capacity as sovereigns,&#xD;
hold title to the beds under navigable waters has origins&#xD;
in English common law. See Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S.&#xD;
1, 13 (1894). A distinction was made in England between&#xD;
waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide (royal rivers)&#xD;
and nontidal waters (public highways). With respect to&#xD;
royal rivers, the Crown was presumed to hold title to the&#xD;
riverbed and soil, but the public retained the right of&#xD;
passage and the right to fish in the stream. With respect&#xD;
to public highways, as the name suggests, the public also&#xD;
retained the right of water passage; but title to the riv­&#xD;
erbed and soil, as a general matter, was held in private&#xD;
ownership. Riparian landowners shared title, with each&#xD;
owning from his side to the center thread of the stream, as&#xD;
well as the exclusive right to fish there. See Idaho v.&#xD;
Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 285 (1997)&#xD;

in Relation to Water-Courses 14–18 (1824)); 3 J. Kent,&#xD;
Commentaries on American Law 528–529 (9th ed. 1858).&#xD;
   While the tide-based distinction for bed title was the&#xD;
initial rule in the 13 Colonies, after the Revolution Ameri­&#xD;
can law moved to a different standard. Some state courts&#xD;
came early to the conclusion that a State holds presump­&#xD;
tive title to navigable waters whether or not the waters&#xD;
are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide. See, e.g., Car-&#xD;
son v. Blazer, 2 Binn. 475 (Pa. 1810); Executors of Cates v.&#xD;
Wadlington, 12 S. C. L. 580 (1822); Wilson v. Forbes, 13&#xD;
N. C. 30 (1828); Bullock v. Wilson, 2 Port. 436 (Ala. 1835);&#xD;
Elder v. Burrus, 25 Tenn. 358 (1845). The tidal rule of&#xD;
“navigability” for sovereign ownership of riverbeds, while&#xD;
perhaps appropriate for England’s dominant coastal geog­&#xD;
raphy, was ill suited to the United States with its vast&#xD;
number of major inland rivers upon which navigation&#xD;
could be sustained. See L. Houck, Law of Navigable Riv­&#xD;
ers 26–27, 31–35 (1868); Packer v. Bird, 137 U. S. 661,&#xD;
667–669 (1891). By the late 19th century, the Court had&#xD;
recognized “the now prevailing doctrine” of state sovereign&#xD;
“title in the soil of rivers really navigable.” Shively, supra,&#xD;
at 31; see Barney v. Keokuk, 94 U. S. 324, 336 (1877) (“In&#xD;
this country, as a general thing, all waters are deemed&#xD;
navigable which are really so”). This title rule became&#xD;
known as “navigability in fact.”&#xD;
   The rule for state riverbed title assumed federal consti­&#xD;
tutional significance under the equal-footing doctrine. In&#xD;
1842, the Court declared that for the 13 original States,&#xD;
the people of each State, based on principles of sovereign­&#xD;
ty, “hold the absolute right to all their navigable waters&#xD;
and the soils under them,” subject only to rights surren­&#xD;
dered and powers granted by the Constitution to the&#xD;
Federal Government. Martin v. Lessee of Waddell, 16 Pet.&#xD;
367, 410 (1842). In a series of 19th-century cases, the&#xD;
Court determined that the same principle applied to&#xD;
12            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
States later admitted to the Union, because the States in&#xD;
the Union are coequal sovereigns under the Constitution.&#xD;
See, e.g., Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, 228–229&#xD;
(1845); Knight v. United States Land Assn., 142 U. S. 161,&#xD;
183 (1891); Shively, supra, at 26–31; see United States v.&#xD;
Texas, 339 U. S. 707, 716 (1950). These precedents are the&#xD;
basis for the equal-footing doctrine, under which a State’s&#xD;
title to these lands was “conferred not by Congress but by&#xD;
the Constitution itself.” Oregon ex rel. State Land Bd. v.&#xD;
Corvallis Sand &amp; Gravel Co., 429 U. S. 363, 374 (1977). It&#xD;
follows that any ensuing questions of navigability for de-&#xD;
termining state riverbed title are governed by federal&#xD;
law. See, e.g., United States v. Utah, 283 U. S. 64, 75&#xD;
(1931); United States v. Oregon, 295 U. S. 1, 14 (1935).&#xD;
   The title consequences of the equal-footing doctrine can&#xD;
be stated in summary form: Upon statehood, the State&#xD;
gains title within its borders to the beds of waters then&#xD;
navigable (or tidally influenced, see Phillips Petroleum Co.&#xD;
v. Mississippi, 484 U. S. 469 (1988), although that is not&#xD;
relevant in this case). It may allocate and govern those&#xD;
lands according to state law subject only to “the para­&#xD;
mount power of the United States to control such waters&#xD;
for purposes of navigation in interstate and foreign com­&#xD;
merce.” Oregon, supra, at 14; see Montana v. United&#xD;
States, 450 U. S. 544, 551 (1981); United States v. Holt&#xD;
State Bank, 270 U. S. 49, 54 (1926). The United States&#xD;
retains any title vested in it before statehood to any land&#xD;
beneath waters not then navigable (and not tidally influ­&#xD;
enced), to be transferred or licensed if and as it chooses.&#xD;
See Utah, supra, at 75; Oregon, supra, at 14.&#xD;
   Returning to the “navigability in fact” rule, the Court&#xD;
has explained the elements of this test. A basic formula­&#xD;
tion of the rule was set forth in The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall.&#xD;
557 (1871), a case concerning federal power to regulate&#xD;
navigation:&#xD;
                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           13&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
    “Those rivers must be regarded as public navigable&#xD;
    rivers in law which are navigable in fact. And they&#xD;
    are navigable in fact when they are used, or are sus­&#xD;
    ceptible of being used, in their ordinary condition, as&#xD;
    highways for commerce, over which trade and travel&#xD;
    are or may be conducted in the customary modes of&#xD;
    trade and travel on water.” Id., at 563.&#xD;
   The Daniel Ball formulation has been invoked in con­&#xD;
sidering the navigability of waters for purposes of as­&#xD;
sessing federal regulatory authority under the Constitu­&#xD;
tion, and the application of specific federal statutes, as to&#xD;
the waters and their beds. See, e.g., ibid.; The Montello,&#xD;
20 Wall. 430, 439 (1874); United States v. Appalachian&#xD;
Elec. Power Co., 311 U. S. 377, 406, and n. 21 (1940) (Fed­&#xD;
eral Power Act); Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715,&#xD;
730–731 (2006) (plurality opinion) (Clean Water Act); id.,&#xD;
at 761 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) (same). It&#xD;
has been used as well to determine questions of title to&#xD;
water beds under the equal-footing doctrine. See Utah,&#xD;
supra, at 76; Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S. 574, 586&#xD;
(1922); Holt State Bank, supra, at 56. It should be noted,&#xD;
however, that the test for navigability is not applied in the&#xD;
same way in these distinct types of cases.&#xD;
   Among the differences in application are the following.&#xD;
For state title under the equal-footing doctrine, naviga­&#xD;
bility is determined at the time of statehood, see Utah,&#xD;
supra, at 75, and based on the “natural and ordinary con-&#xD;
dition” of the water, see Oklahoma, supra, at 591. In&#xD;
contrast, admiralty jurisdiction extends to water routes&#xD;
made navigable even if not formerly so, see, e.g., Ex parte&#xD;
Boyer, 109 U. S. 629, 631–632 (1884) (artificial canal); and&#xD;
federal regulatory authority encompasses waters that only&#xD;
recently have become navigable, see, e.g., Philadelphia Co.&#xD;
v. Stimson, 223 U. S. 605, 634–635 (1912), were once&#xD;
navigable but are no longer, see Economy Light &amp; Power&#xD;

&#xD;
Co. v. United States, 256 U. S. 113, 123–124 (1921), or are&#xD;
not navigable and never have been but may become so by&#xD;
reasonable improvements, see Appalachian Elec. Power&#xD;
Co., supra, at 407–408. With respect to the federal com­&#xD;
merce power, the inquiry regarding navigation historically&#xD;
focused on interstate commerce. See The Daniel Ball,&#xD;
supra, at 564. And, of course, the commerce power ex­&#xD;
tends beyond navigation. See Kaiser Aetna v. United&#xD;
States, 444 U. S. 164, 173–174 (1979). In contrast, for title&#xD;
purposes, the inquiry depends only on navigation and not&#xD;
on interstate travel. See Utah, supra, at 76. This list of&#xD;
differences is not exhaustive. Indeed, “[e]ach application&#xD;
of [the Daniel Ball] test . . . is apt to uncover variations&#xD;
and refinements which require further elaboration.” Ap-&#xD;

                              A&#xD;
&#xD;
  The primary flaw in the reasoning of the Montana Su­&#xD;
preme Court lies in its treatment of the question of river&#xD;
segments and overland portage.&#xD;
  To determine title to a riverbed under the equal-footing&#xD;
doctrine, this Court considers the river on a segment­&#xD;
by-segment basis to assess whether the segment of the&#xD;
river, under which the riverbed in dispute lies, is navigable&#xD;
or not. In United States v. Utah, for example, the Court&#xD;
noted,&#xD;
     “the controversy relates only to the sections of the riv­&#xD;
     ers which are described in the complaint, and the&#xD;
     Master has limited his findings and conclusions as to&#xD;
     navigability accordingly. The propriety of this course,&#xD;
     in view of the physical characteristics of the streams,&#xD;
     is apparent. Even where the navigability of a river,&#xD;
     speaking generally, is a matter of common knowledge,&#xD;
     and hence one of which judicial notice may be taken,&#xD;
     it may yet be a question, to be determined upon evi­&#xD;
                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           15&#xD;
&#xD;
                      Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
    dence, how far navigability extends.” 283 U. S., at 77.&#xD;
The Court went on to conclude, after reciting and as­&#xD;
sessing the evidence, that the Colorado River was naviga­&#xD;
ble for its first roughly 4-mile stretch, nonnavigable for the&#xD;
next roughly 36-mile stretch, and navigable for its remain­&#xD;
ing 149 miles. Id., at 73–74, 79–81, 89. The Court noted&#xD;
the importance of determining “the exact point at which&#xD;
navigability may be deemed to end.” Id., at 90.&#xD;
  Similarly, in Brewer-Elliott Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. United&#xD;
States, 260 U. S. 77, 85 (1922), the Court examined the&#xD;
segment of the Arkansas River that ran along the Osage&#xD;
Indian Reservation, assessing whether the Arkansas River&#xD;
was “navigable in fact at the locus in quo.” The Court&#xD;
concluded that the United States originally, and the Osag­&#xD;
es as its grantees, unequivocally held title to the riverbeds&#xD;
because the Arkansas River “is and was not navigable at&#xD;
the place where the river bed lots, here in controversy,&#xD;
are.” Id., at 86. The Court found the segment of river&#xD;
along the reservation to be nonnavigable even though a&#xD;
segment of the river that began further downstream was&#xD;
navigable. Ibid. See also Oklahoma, supra, at 583, 584,&#xD;
587–588, 589–591 (noting that “how far up the streams&#xD;
navigability extended was not known”; assessing separate­&#xD;
ly the segments of the Red River above and below its&#xD;
confluence with the Washita River within Oklahoma’s&#xD;
borders; and concluding that neither segment, and hence&#xD;
“no part of the river within Oklahoma,” was navigable).&#xD;
  The Montana Supreme Court discounted the segment­&#xD;
by-segment approach of this Court’s cases, calling it&#xD;
“a piecemeal classification of navigability—with some&#xD;
stretches declared navigable, and others declared non­&#xD;
navigable.” 355 Mont., at 440–442, 229 P. 3d, at 448–449.&#xD;
This was error. The segment-by-segment approach to&#xD;
navigability for title is well settled, and it should not be&#xD;
disregarded. A key justification for sovereign ownership of&#xD;

&#xD;
                      Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
navigable riverbeds is that a contrary rule would allow&#xD;
private riverbed owners to erect improvements on the&#xD;
riverbeds that could interfere with the public’s right to use&#xD;
the waters as a highway for commerce. While the Federal&#xD;
Government and States retain regulatory power to protect&#xD;
public navigation, allocation to the State of the beds un­&#xD;
derlying navigable rivers reduces the possibility of conflict&#xD;
between private and public interests. See Utah, supra, at&#xD;
82–83; Packer, 137 U. S., at 667. By contrast, segments&#xD;
that are nonnavigable at the time of statehood are those&#xD;
over which commerce could not then occur. Thus, there is&#xD;
no reason that these segments also should be deemed&#xD;
owned by the State under the equal-footing doctrine.&#xD;
   Practical considerations also support segmentation.&#xD;
Physical conditions that affect navigability often vary&#xD;
significantly over the length of a river. This is particularly&#xD;
true with longer rivers, which can traverse vastly different&#xD;
terrain and the flow of which can be affected by varying&#xD;
local climates. The Missouri River provides an excellent&#xD;
example: Between its headwaters and mouth, it runs for&#xD;
over 2,000 miles out of steep mountains, through canyons&#xD;
and upon rocky beds, over waterfalls and rapids, and&#xD;
across sandy plains, capturing runoff from snow melt and&#xD;
farmland rains alike. These shifts in physical conditions&#xD;
provide a means to determine appropriate start points and&#xD;
end points for the segment in question. Topographical and&#xD;
geographical indicators may assist. See, e.g., Utah, supra,&#xD;
at 77–80 (gradient changes); Oklahoma, 258 U. S., at 589&#xD;
(location of tributary providing additional flow).&#xD;
   A segment approach to riverbed title allocation under&#xD;
the equal-footing doctrine is consistent with the manner in&#xD;
which private parties seek to establish riverbed title. For&#xD;
centuries, where title to the riverbed was not in the sover­&#xD;
eign, the common-law rule for allocating riverbed title&#xD;
among riparian landowners involved apportionment de­&#xD;
fined both by segment (each landowner owns bed and soil&#xD;
                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          17&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
along the length of his land adjacent) and thread (each&#xD;
landowner owns bed and soil to the center of the stream).&#xD;
See J. Angell, A Treatise on the Law of Watercourses&#xD;
18 (6th ed. 1869); Tyler v. Wilkinson, 24 F. Cas. 472, 474&#xD;
(No. 14,312) (CC RI 1827) (Story, J.). Montana, moreover,&#xD;
cannot suggest that segmentation is inadministrable when&#xD;
the state courts managed to divide up and apportion the&#xD;
underlying riverbeds for purposes of determining their&#xD;
value and the corresponding rents owed by PPL.&#xD;
  The Montana Supreme Court, relying upon Utah, de-&#xD;
cided that the segment-by-segment approach is inapplicable&#xD;
here because it “does not apply to ‘short interruption[s] of&#xD;
navigability in a stream otherwise navigable.’ ” 355 Mont.,&#xD;
at 442, 229 P. 3d, at 449 (quoting Utah, 283 U. S., at 77).&#xD;
This was mistaken. In Utah, this Court noted in pass­&#xD;
ing that the facts of the case concerned “long reaches&#xD;
with particular characteristics of navigability or non­&#xD;
navigability” rather than “short interruption[s].” Id., at&#xD;
77. The Court in Utah did not say the case would have a&#xD;
different outcome if a “short interruption” were concerned.&#xD;
Ibid.&#xD;
  Even if the law might find some nonnavigable segments&#xD;
so minimal that they merit treatment as part of a longer,&#xD;
navigable reach for purposes of title under the equal­&#xD;
footing doctrine, it is doubtful that any of the segments in&#xD;
this case would meet that standard, and one—the Great&#xD;
Falls reach—certainly would not. As an initial matter, the&#xD;
kinds of considerations that would define a de minimis&#xD;
exception to the segment-by-segment approach would be&#xD;
those related to principles of ownership and title, such as&#xD;
inadministrability of parcels of exceedingly small size,&#xD;
or worthlessness of the parcels due to overdivision. See&#xD;
Heller, The Tragedy of the Anticommons, 111 Harv. L.&#xD;
Rev. 621, 682–684 (1998) (explaining that dividing prop-&#xD;
erty into square-inch parcels, could, absent countervail-&#xD;
ing legal mechanisms, “paralyze the alienability of scarce&#xD;

&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
resources . . . or diminish their value too drastically”). An&#xD;
analysis of segmentation must be sensibly applied. A&#xD;
comparison of the nonnavigable segment’s length to the&#xD;
overall length of the stream, for instance, would be simply&#xD;
irrelevant to the issue at hand.&#xD;
   A number of the segments at issue here are both dis­&#xD;
crete, as defined by physical features characteristic of&#xD;
navigability or nonnavigability, and substantial, as a&#xD;
matter of administrability for title purposes. This is best&#xD;
illustrated by the Great Falls reach, which is 17 miles long&#xD;
and has distinct drops including five waterfalls and con­&#xD;
tinuous rapids in between. There is plenty of reason to&#xD;
doubt that reach’s navigability based on the presence of&#xD;
the series of falls. There is also reason to think that title&#xD;
to that segment of bed would not be worthless or inadmin­&#xD;
istrable. Indeed, the State sought and was awarded rent&#xD;
in the amount of $41 million for PPL’s various hydroelec­&#xD;
tric facilities attached to the riverbeds, half of which are&#xD;
along the Great Falls reach.&#xD;
   Applying its “short interruptions” approach, the Mon­&#xD;
tana Supreme Court decided that the Great Falls reach&#xD;
was navigable because it could be managed by way of land&#xD;
route portage. 355 Mont., at 440, 442, 229 P. 3d, at 447,&#xD;
449. The court noted in particular the portage of Lewis&#xD;
and Clark’s expedition. Ibid. Yet that very portage re­&#xD;
veals the problem with the Montana Supreme Court’s&#xD;
analysis. Leaving behind their larger boats, Lewis and&#xD;
Clark transported their supplies and some small canoes&#xD;
about 18 miles over land, which took at least 11 days and&#xD;
probably more. See Lewis and Clark Journals 126–152;&#xD;
9 Journals of the Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition 173; Dear&#xD;
Brother 109. Even if portage were to take travelers only&#xD;
one day, its significance is the same: it demonstrates the&#xD;
need to bypass the river segment, all because that part of&#xD;
the river is nonnavigable. Thus, the Montana Supreme&#xD;
Court was wrong to state, with respect to the Great Falls&#xD;

&#xD;
                      Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
reach and other stretches of the rivers in question, that&#xD;
portages “are not sufficient to defeat a finding of navigabil­&#xD;
ity.” 355 Mont., at 438, 229 P. 3d, at 446. In most cases,&#xD;
they are, because they require transportation over land&#xD;
rather than over the water. This is such a case, at least as&#xD;
to the Great Falls reach.&#xD;
   In reaching its conclusion that the necessity of portage&#xD;
does not undermine navigability, the Montana Supreme&#xD;
Court misapplied this Court’s decision in The Montello, 20&#xD;
Wall. 430. See 355 Mont., at 438, 229 P. 3d, at 446. The&#xD;
consideration of portage in The Montello was for a differ­&#xD;
ent purpose. The Court did not seek to determine whether&#xD;
the river in question was navigable for title purposes but&#xD;
instead whether it was navigable for purposes of deter­&#xD;
mining whether boats upon it could be regulated by the&#xD;
Federal Government. 20 Wall., at 439, 445. The primary&#xD;
focus in The Montello was not upon navigability in fact&#xD;
but upon whether the river was a “navigable water of the&#xD;
United States.” Id., at 439, 443. The latter inquiry is&#xD;
doctrinally distinct. It turns upon whether the river&#xD;
“forms by itself, or by its connection with other waters, a&#xD;
continued highway over which commerce is, or may be,&#xD;
carried with other States or foreign countries in the cus­&#xD;
tomary modes in which such commerce is conducted by&#xD;
water.” Id., at 439 (citing The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557).&#xD;
It is language similar to “continued highway” that Mon­&#xD;
tana urges the Court to import into the title context in lieu&#xD;
of the Court’s established segmentation approach. Brief&#xD;
for Respondent 42–43, n. 16.&#xD;
   The Montello reasonably concluded that the portages&#xD;
required in that case did not prevent the river from being&#xD;
part of a channel of interstate commerce. Portages con­&#xD;
tinued that channel because goods could be successfully&#xD;
transported interstate, in part upon the waters in ques­&#xD;
tion. This provided sufficient basis to regulate steamboats&#xD;
at places where those boats could and did, in fact, navigate&#xD;

&#xD;
                      Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
portions of the river. 20 Wall., at 445. Here, by contrast,&#xD;
the question regards ownership of the bed under river&#xD;
segments that the Montana Supreme Court, by calling&#xD;
them “interruptions in the navigation,” 355 Mont., at 442,&#xD;
229 P. 3d, at 449, acknowledges were nonnavigable. The&#xD;
reasoning and the inquiry of The Montello does not control&#xD;
the outcome where the quite different concerns of the&#xD;
riverbed title context apply.&#xD;
   Having clarified that portages may defeat navigability&#xD;
for title purposes, and do so with respect to the Great Falls&#xD;
reach, the Court sees no evidence in the record that could&#xD;
demonstrate that the Great Falls reach was navigable.&#xD;
Montana does not dispute that overland portage was&#xD;
necessary to traverse that reach. Indeed, the State admits&#xD;
“the falls themselves were not passable by boat at state­&#xD;
hood.” Brief for Respondent 10. And the trial court noted&#xD;
the falls had never been navigated. App. to Pet. for&#xD;
Cert. 137. Based on these statements, this Court now con­&#xD;
cludes, contrary to the Montana Supreme Court’s decision,&#xD;
that the 17-mile Great Falls reach, at least from the head&#xD;
of the first waterfall to the foot of the last, is not navigable&#xD;
for purposes of riverbed title under the equal-footing&#xD;
doctrine.&#xD;
   This Court also determines, based on evidence in the&#xD;
record, that there is a significant likelihood that some of&#xD;
the other river stretches in dispute also fail the federal&#xD;
test of navigability for the purpose of determining title.&#xD;
For example, as to the disputed segment of the Clark Fork&#xD;
River, the Montana Supreme Court incorrectly stated the&#xD;
sole evidence for nonnavigability “consists of conclusory&#xD;
statements . . . without any specific factual support.” 355&#xD;
Mont., at 440, 229 P. 3d, at 448. In fact, PPL introduced a&#xD;
report of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers from 1891,&#xD;
two years after Montana’s date of statehood, documenting&#xD;
that the portion of the Clark Fork river between Missoula&#xD;
and Lake Pend Oreille (which includes the location of&#xD;

&#xD;
                      Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
PPL’s Thompson Falls facility) had a fall of about 1,100&#xD;
feet in 250 miles and “is a mountain torrential stream, full&#xD;
of rocks, rapids, and falls, . . . utterly unnavigable, and in-&#xD;
capable of being made navigable except at an enormous&#xD;
cost.” 2 H. R. Exec. Doc., pt. 5, at 3250; see App. 379–380&#xD;
(Docket No. 169). The report based its conclusions on&#xD;
various failed attempts to navigate the river. It found the&#xD;
Thompson Falls “a complete obstruction to navigation”&#xD;
and the river around that area “exceedingly rapid, rough,&#xD;
and full of rocks.” 2 H. R. Exec. Doc., pt. 5, at 3251. This&#xD;
was consistent with a 1910 Federal District Court decree.&#xD;
The decree adjudicated a title dispute between two private&#xD;
parties over the riverbed near and under Thompson Falls&#xD;
and declared the river at that place “was and is a non­&#xD;
navigable stream incapable of carrying the products of&#xD;
the country in the usual manner of water transportation.”&#xD;
Steele v. Donlan, Equity No. 950 (CC D Mont., July 19,&#xD;
1910), p. 1; see App. 380–381 (Docket No. 169). While the&#xD;
ultimate decision as to this and the other disputed river&#xD;
stretches is to be determined, in the first instance, by the&#xD;
Montana courts upon remand, the relevant evidence&#xD;
should be assessed in light of the principles discussed in&#xD;
this opinion.&#xD;
                             B&#xD;
  The Montana Supreme Court further erred as a matter&#xD;
of law in its reliance upon the evidence of present-day,&#xD;
primarily recreational use of the Madison River. Error is&#xD;
not inherent in a court’s consideration of such evidence,&#xD;
but the evidence must be confined to that which shows the&#xD;
river could sustain the kinds of commercial use that, as a&#xD;
realistic matter, might have occurred at the time of state­&#xD;
hood. Navigability must be assessed as of the time of&#xD;
statehood, and it concerns the river’s usefulness for “ ‘trade&#xD;
and travel,’ ” rather than for other purposes. See Utah,&#xD;
283 U. S., at 75–76. Mere use by initial explorers or trap­&#xD;

pers, who may have dragged their boats in or alongside&#xD;
the river despite its nonnavigability in order to avoid&#xD;
getting lost, or to provide water for their horses and them­&#xD;
selves, is not itself enough. See Oregon, 295 U. S., at&#xD;
20–21 (evidence that “trappers appear to have waded or&#xD;
walked” through the river, dragging their boats rather&#xD;
than floating them, had “no bearing on navigability”).&#xD;
   True, river segments are navigable not only if they&#xD;
“[were] used,” but also if they “[were] susceptible of being&#xD;
used,” as highways of commerce at the time of statehood.&#xD;
Utah, supra, at 76 (internal quotation marks omitted).&#xD;
Evidence of recreational use, depending on its nature, may&#xD;
bear upon susceptibility of commercial use at the time of&#xD;
statehood. See Appalachian Elec. Power Co., 311 U. S., at&#xD;
416 (“[P]ersonal or private use by boats demonstrates the&#xD;
availability of the stream for the simpler types of commer­&#xD;
cial navigation”); Utah, 283 U. S., at 82 (fact that actual&#xD;
use has “been more of a private nature than of a public,&#xD;
commercial sort . . . cannot be regarded as controlling”).&#xD;
Similarly, poststatehood evidence, depending on its na­&#xD;
ture, may show susceptibility of use at the time of state­&#xD;
hood. See id., at 82–83 (“[E]xtensive and continued&#xD;
[historical] use for commercial purposes” may be the “most&#xD;
persuasive” form of evidence, but the “crucial question” is&#xD;
the potential for such use at the time of statehood, rather&#xD;
than “the mere manner or extent of actual use”).&#xD;
   Evidence of present-day use may be considered to the&#xD;
extent it informs the historical determination whether the&#xD;
river segment was susceptible of use for commercial navi­&#xD;
gation at the time of statehood. For the susceptibility&#xD;
analysis, it must be determined whether trade and travel&#xD;
could have been conducted “in the customary modes of&#xD;
trade and travel on water,” over the relevant river seg­&#xD;
ment “in [its] natural and ordinary condition.” Id., at 76&#xD;
(internal quotation marks omitted). At a minimum, there­&#xD;

&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
purposes must show: (1) the watercraft are meaningfully&#xD;
similar to those in customary use for trade and travel&#xD;
at the time of statehood; and (2) the river’s poststatehood&#xD;
condition is not materially different from its physical con-&#xD;
dition at statehood. See also Oregon, supra, at 18 (find-&#xD;
ing that scientific and historical evidence showed that&#xD;
the physical condition of particular water bodies had not&#xD;
varied substantially since statehood in a way that might&#xD;
affect navigation). If modern watercraft permit navigabil­&#xD;
ity where the historical watercraft would not, or if the&#xD;
river has changed in ways that substantially improve its&#xD;
navigability, then the evidence of present-day use has&#xD;
little or no bearing on navigability at statehood.&#xD;
   The Montana Supreme Court opinion offered no indica­&#xD;
tion that it made these necessary findings. The court&#xD;
concluded the evidence of present-day use of the Madison&#xD;
was probative of its susceptibility of use at statehood, but&#xD;
there is no apparent basis for its conclusion. 355 Mont., at&#xD;
442–443, 438–439, 229 P. 3d, at 449, 446–447. The court&#xD;
did not find the watercraft similar to those used at the&#xD;
time of statehood, and the State’s evidence of present-day&#xD;
use for recreational fishing did not indicate what types of&#xD;
boats are now used. App. 46–48. Modern recreational&#xD;
fishing boats, including inflatable rafts and lightweight&#xD;
canoes or kayaks, may be able to navigate waters much&#xD;
more shallow or with rockier beds than the boats custom­&#xD;
arily used for trade and travel at statehood.&#xD;
   As to the river’s physical condition, the Montana Su­&#xD;
preme Court did not assess with care PPL’s evidence&#xD;
about changes to the river’s flow and the location and&#xD;
pattern of its channel since statehood. The affidavit of&#xD;
PPL’s expert in fluvial geomorphology—the study of river­&#xD;
related landforms—at least suggests that as a result of&#xD;
PPL’s dams, the river has become “less torrential” in high&#xD;
flow periods and less shallow in low flow periods. App.&#xD;
575–577 (Docket No. 170). Thus, the river may well be&#xD;

&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
easier to navigate now than at statehood.&#xD;
   The Montana Supreme Court altogether ignored the&#xD;
expert’s reasoning about the past condition of the river’s&#xD;
channels and the significance of that information for&#xD;
navigability. Further, contrary to the Montana Supreme&#xD;
Court’s suggestion, the expert’s affidavit was not mere&#xD;
evidence of change in “seasonal variations” of water depth.&#xD;
355 Mont., at 440, 229 P. 3d, at 448. It provided meaning­&#xD;
ful evidence that the river’s conditions had changed since&#xD;
statehood in ways that made present-day navigation of the&#xD;
river easier in all seasons than it was at the relevant time.&#xD;
While the Montana court was correct that a river need not&#xD;
be susceptible of navigation at every point during the year,&#xD;
neither can that susceptibility be so brief that it is not a&#xD;
commercial reality. Against this background, the present­&#xD;
day recreational use of the river did not bear on navigabil­&#xD;
ity for purposes of title under the equal-footing doctrine.&#xD;
The Montana Supreme Court’s reliance upon the State’s&#xD;
evidence of present-day, recreational use, at least without&#xD;
further inquiry, was wrong as a matter of law.&#xD;
                           C&#xD;
  The above analysis is sufficient to require reversal of&#xD;
the grant of summary judgment to Montana. Therefore, the&#xD;
Court declines to decide whether the Montana Supreme&#xD;
Court further erred as to the burden of proof regarding&#xD;
navigability.&#xD;
                            D&#xD;
  As a final contention, the State of Montana suggests&#xD;
that denying the State title to the riverbeds here in dis­&#xD;
pute will undermine the public trust doctrine, which con­&#xD;
cerns public access to the waters above those beds for&#xD;
purposes of navigation, fishing, and other recreational&#xD;
uses. Brief for Respondent 20, 24–26. This suggestion&#xD;
underscores the State’s misapprehension of the equal&#xD;

                      Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
footing and public trust doctrines.&#xD;
   The public trust doctrine is of ancient origin. Its roots&#xD;
trace to Roman civil law and its principles can be found in&#xD;
the English common law on public navigation and fishing&#xD;
rights over tidal lands and in the state laws of this coun­&#xD;
try. See Coeur d’Alene, 521 U. S., at 284–286; Illinois&#xD;
Central R. Co. v. Illinois, 146 U. S. 387, 458 (1892);&#xD;
D. Slade, Putting the Public Trust Doctrine to Work 3–8,&#xD;
15–24 (1990); see, e.g., National Audubon Soc. v. Superior&#xD;
Court of Alpine Cty., 33 Cal. 3d 419, 433–441, 658 P. 2d&#xD;
709, 718–724 (1983); Arnold v. Mundy, 6 N. J. L. 1, 9–10&#xD;
(1821). Unlike the equal-footing doctrine, however, which&#xD;
is the constitutional foundation for the navigability rule of&#xD;
riverbed title, the public trust doctrine remains a matter&#xD;
of state law, see Coeur d’Alene, supra, at 285 (Illinois&#xD;
Central, a Supreme Court public trust case, was “ ‘neces­&#xD;
sarily a statement of Illinois law’ ”); Appleby v. City of New&#xD;
York, 271 U. S. 364, 395 (1926) (same), subject as well to&#xD;
the federal power to regulate vessels and navigation under&#xD;
the Commerce Clause and admiralty power. While equal­&#xD;
footing cases have noted that the State takes title to the&#xD;
navigable waters and their beds in trust for the public, see&#xD;
Shively, 152 U. S., at 49, 15–17, 24, 46, the contours of&#xD;
that public trust do not depend upon the Constitution.&#xD;
Under accepted principles of federalism, the States retain&#xD;
residual power to determine the scope of the public trust&#xD;
over waters within their borders, while federal law deter­&#xD;
mines riverbed title under the equal-footing doctrine.&#xD;
                             V&#xD;
   As the litigation history of this case shows, Montana&#xD;
filed its claim for riverbed rent over a century after the&#xD;
first of the dams was built upon the riverbeds. Montana&#xD;
had not sought compensation before then, despite its full&#xD;
awareness of PPL’s hydroelectric projects and despite the&#xD;
State’s own participation in the projects’ federal licensing&#xD;

process. While this Court does not reach the question, it&#xD;
may be that by virtue of the State’s sovereignty, neither&#xD;
laches nor estoppel could apply in a strict sense to bar the&#xD;
State’s much belated claim. Still, the reliance by PPL and&#xD;
its predecessors in title upon the State’s long failure to&#xD;
assert title is some evidence to support the conclusion that&#xD;
the river segments were nonnavigable for purposes of the&#xD;
equal-footing doctrine.&#xD;
   The Montana Supreme Court’s ruling that Montana&#xD;
owns and may charge for use of riverbeds across the&#xD;
State was based upon an infirm legal understanding of&#xD;
this Court’s rules of navigability for title under the equal­&#xD;
footing doctrine. As the Court said in Brewer-Elliott, “It is&#xD;
not for a State by courts or legislature, in dealing with the&#xD;
general subject of beds or streams, to adopt a retroactive&#xD;
rule for determining navigability which . . . would enlarge&#xD;
what actually passed to the State, at the time of her ad­&#xD;
mission, under the constitutional rule of equality here&#xD;
invoked.” 260 U. S., at 88.&#xD;
