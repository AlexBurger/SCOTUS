CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&#xD;
                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT&#xD;
&#xD;
      No. 04–480.      Argued March 29, 2005—Decided June 27, 2005&#xD;
Respondent companies distribute free software that allows computer&#xD;
  users to share electronic files through peer-to-peer networks, so&#xD;
  called because the computers communicate directly with each other,&#xD;
  not through central servers. Although such networks can be used to&#xD;
  share any type of digital file, recipients of respondents’ software have&#xD;
  mostly used them to share copyrighted music and video files without&#xD;
  authorization. Seeking damages and an injunction, a group of movie&#xD;
  studios and other copyright holders (hereinafter MGM) sued respon-&#xD;
  dents for their users’ copyright infringements, alleging that respon-&#xD;
  dents knowingly and intentionally distributed their software to en-&#xD;
  able users to infringe copyrighted works in violation of the Copyright&#xD;
  Act.&#xD;
    Discovery revealed that billions of files are shared across peer-to-&#xD;
  peer networks each month. Respondents are aware that users em-&#xD;
  ploy their software primarily to download copyrighted files, although&#xD;
  the decentralized networks do not reveal which files are copied, and&#xD;
  when. Respondents have sometimes learned about the infringement&#xD;
  directly when users have e-mailed questions regarding copyrighted&#xD;
  works, and respondents have replied with guidance. Respondents&#xD;
  are not merely passive recipients of information about infringement.&#xD;
  The record is replete with evidence that when they began to distrib-&#xD;
  ute their free software, each of them clearly voiced the objective that&#xD;
  recipients use the software to download copyrighted works and took&#xD;
  active steps to encourage infringement. After the notorious file-&#xD;
  sharing service, Napster, was sued by copyright holders for facilitat-&#xD;
  ing copyright infringement, both respondents promoted and mar-&#xD;
  keted themselves as Napster alternatives. They receive no revenue&#xD;

    from users, but, instead, generate income by selling advertising&#xD;
    space, then streaming the advertising to their users. As the number&#xD;
    of users increases, advertising opportunities are worth more. There&#xD;
    is no evidence that either respondent made an effort to filter copy-&#xD;
    righted material from users’ downloads or otherwise to impede the&#xD;
    sharing of copyrighted files.&#xD;
       While acknowledging that respondents’ users had directly in-&#xD;
    fringed MGM’s copyrights, the District Court nonetheless granted re-&#xD;
    spondents summary judgment as to liability arising from distribution&#xD;
    of their software. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. It read Sony Corp. of&#xD;
    America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417, as holding that&#xD;
    the distribution of a commercial product capable of substantial nonin-&#xD;
    fringing uses could not give rise to contributory liability for infringe-&#xD;
    ment unless the distributor had actual knowledge of specific in-&#xD;
    stances of infringement and failed to act on that knowledge. Because&#xD;
    the appeals court found respondents’ software to be capable of sub-&#xD;
    stantial noninfringing uses and because respondents had no actual&#xD;
    knowledge of infringement owing to the software’s decentralized ar-&#xD;
    chitecture, the court held that they were not liable. It also held that&#xD;
    they did not materially contribute to their users’ infringement be-&#xD;
    cause the users themselves searched for, retrieved, and stored the in-&#xD;
    fringing files, with no involvement by respondents beyond providing&#xD;
    the software in the first place. Finally, the court held that respon-&#xD;
    dents could not be held liable under a vicarious infringement theory&#xD;
    because they did not monitor or control the software’s use, had no&#xD;
    agreed-upon right or current ability to supervise its use, and had no&#xD;
    independent duty to police infringement.&#xD;
Held: One who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use&#xD;
 to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirma-&#xD;
 tive steps taken to foster infringement, going beyond mere distribu-&#xD;
 tion with knowledge of third-party action, is liable for the resulting&#xD;
 acts of infringement by third parties using the device, regardless of&#xD;
 the device’s lawful uses. Pp. 10–24.&#xD;
    (a) The tension between the competing values of supporting crea-&#xD;
 tivity through copyright protection and promoting technological inno-&#xD;
 vation by limiting infringement liability is the subject of this case.&#xD;
 Despite offsetting considerations, the argument for imposing indirect&#xD;
 liability here is powerful, given the number of infringing downloads&#xD;
 that occur daily using respondents’ software. When a widely shared&#xD;
 product is used to commit infringement, it may be impossible to en-&#xD;
 force rights in the protected work effectively against all direct in-&#xD;
 fringers, so that the only practical alternative is to go against the de-&#xD;
 vice’s distributor for secondary liability on a theory of contributory or&#xD;
 vicarious infringement. One infringes contributorily by intentionally&#xD;
                   Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                     3&#xD;
&#xD;
                              Syllabus&#xD;
&#xD;
inducing or encouraging direct infringement, and infringes vicari-&#xD;
ously by profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise&#xD;
the right to stop or limit it. Although “[t]he Copyright Act does not&#xD;
expressly render anyone liable for [another’s] infringement,” Sony,&#xD;
464 U. S., at 434, these secondary liability doctrines emerged from&#xD;
common law principles and are well established in the law, e.g., id.,&#xD;
at 486. Pp. 10–13.&#xD;
   (b) Sony addressed a claim that secondary liability for infringement&#xD;
can arise from the very distribution of a commercial product. There,&#xD;
copyright holders sued Sony, the manufacturer of videocassette re-&#xD;
corders, claiming that it was contributorily liable for the infringe-&#xD;
ment that occurred when VCR owners taped copyrighted programs.&#xD;
The evidence showed that the VCR’s principal use was “time-&#xD;
shifting,” i.e., taping a program for later viewing at a more conven-&#xD;
ient time, which the Court found to be a fair, noninfringing use. 464&#xD;
U. S., at 423–424. Moreover, there was no evidence that Sony had&#xD;
desired to bring about taping in violation of copyright or taken active&#xD;
steps to increase its profits from unlawful taping. Id., at 438. On&#xD;
those facts, the only conceivable basis for liability was on a theory of&#xD;
contributory infringement through distribution of a product. Id., at&#xD;
439. Because the VCR was “capable of commercially significant non-&#xD;
infringing uses,” the Court held that Sony was not liable. Id., at 442.&#xD;
This theory reflected patent law’s traditional staple article of com-&#xD;
merce doctrine that distribution of a component of a patented device&#xD;
will not violate the patent if it is suitable for use in other ways. 35&#xD;
U. S. C §271(c). The doctrine absolves the equivocal conduct of sell-&#xD;
ing an item with lawful and unlawful uses and limits liability to in-&#xD;
stances of more acute fault. In this case, the Ninth Circuit misread&#xD;
Sony to mean that when a product is capable of substantial lawful&#xD;
use, the producer cannot be held contributorily liable for third par-&#xD;
ties’ infringing use of it, even when an actual purpose to cause in-&#xD;
fringing use is shown, unless the distributors had specific knowledge&#xD;
of infringement at a time when they contributed to the infringement&#xD;
and failed to act upon that information. Sony did not displace other&#xD;
secondary liability theories. Pp. 13–17.&#xD;
   (c) Nothing in Sony requires courts to ignore evidence of intent to&#xD;
promote infringement if such evidence exists. It was never meant to&#xD;
foreclose rules of fault-based liability derived from the common law.&#xD;
464 U. S., at 439. Where evidence goes beyond a product’s character-&#xD;
istics or the knowledge that it may be put to infringing uses, and&#xD;
shows statements or actions directed to promoting infringement,&#xD;
Sony’s staple-article rule will not preclude liability. At common law a&#xD;
copyright or patent defendant who “not only expected but invoked&#xD;
[infringing use] by advertisement” was liable for infringement.&#xD;

&#xD;
    Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers, 222 U. S. 55, 62–63. The rule on in-&#xD;
    ducement of infringement as developed in the early cases is no differ-&#xD;
    ent today. Evidence of active steps taken to encourage direct in-&#xD;
    fringement, such as advertising an infringing use or instructing how&#xD;
    to engage in an infringing use, shows an affirmative intent that the&#xD;
    product be used to infringe, and overcomes the law’s reluctance to&#xD;
    find liability when a defendant merely sells a commercial product&#xD;
    suitable for some lawful use. A rule that premises liability on pur-&#xD;
    poseful, culpable expression and conduct does nothing to compromise&#xD;
    legitimate commerce or discourage innovation having a lawful prom-&#xD;
    ise. Pp. 17–20.&#xD;
       (d) On the record presented, respondents’ unlawful objective is un-&#xD;
    mistakable. The classic instance of inducement is by advertisement&#xD;
    or solicitation that broadcasts a message designed to stimulate others&#xD;
    to commit violations. MGM argues persuasively that such a message&#xD;
    is shown here. Three features of the evidence of intent are particu-&#xD;
    larly notable. First, each of the respondents showed itself to be aim-&#xD;
    ing to satisfy a known source of demand for copyright infringement,&#xD;
    the market comprising former Napster users. Respondents’ efforts to&#xD;
    supply services to former Napster users indicate a principal, if not&#xD;
    exclusive, intent to bring about infringement. Second, neither re-&#xD;
    spondent attempted to develop filtering tools or other mechanisms to&#xD;
    diminish the infringing activity using their software. While the&#xD;
    Ninth Circuit treated that failure as irrelevant because respondents&#xD;
    lacked an independent duty to monitor their users’ activity, this evi-&#xD;
    dence underscores their intentional facilitation of their users’ in-&#xD;
    fringement. Third, respondents make money by selling advertising&#xD;
    space, then by directing ads to the screens of computers employing&#xD;
    their software. The more their software is used, the more ads are&#xD;
    sent out and the greater the advertising revenue. Since the extent of&#xD;
    the software’s use determines the gain to the distributors, the com-&#xD;
    mercial sense of their enterprise turns on high-volume use, which the&#xD;
    record shows is infringing. This evidence alone would not justify an&#xD;
    inference of unlawful intent, but its import is clear in the entire re-&#xD;
    cord’s context. Pp. 20–23.&#xD;
       (e) In addition to intent to bring about infringement and distribu-&#xD;
    tion of a device suitable for infringing use, the inducement theory re-&#xD;
    quires evidence of actual infringement by recipients of the device, the&#xD;
    software in this case. There is evidence of such infringement on a gi-&#xD;
    gantic scale. Because substantial evidence supports MGM on all&#xD;
    elements, summary judgment for respondents was error. On re-&#xD;
    mand, reconsideration of MGM’s summary judgment motion will be&#xD;
    in order. Pp. 23–24.&#xD;

                                 [June 27, 2005]&#xD;
&#xD;
   JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.&#xD;
   The question is under what circumstances the distribu-&#xD;
tor of a product capable of both lawful and unlawful use is&#xD;
liable for acts of copyright infringement by third parties&#xD;
using the product. We hold that one who distributes a&#xD;
device with the object of promoting its use to infringe&#xD;
copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirma-&#xD;
tive steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the&#xD;
resulting acts of infringement by third parties.&#xD;
                              I&#xD;
                              A&#xD;
   Respondents, Grokster, Ltd., and StreamCast Networks,&#xD;
Inc., defendants in the trial court, distribute free software&#xD;
products that allow computer users to share electronic&#xD;
files through peer-to-peer networks, so called because&#xD;
users’ computers communicate directly with each other,&#xD;
not through central servers. The advantage of peer-to-&#xD;
peer networks over information networks of other types&#xD;
shows up in their substantial and growing popularity.&#xD;
Because they need no central computer server to mediate&#xD;
the exchange of information or files among users, the high-&#xD;
2          METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER STUDIOS INC. v.&#xD;
                     GROKSTER, LTD.&#xD;
                    Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
bandwidth communications capacity for a server may be&#xD;
dispensed with, and the need for costly server storage&#xD;
space is eliminated. Since copies of a file (particularly a&#xD;
popular one) are available on many users’ computers, file&#xD;
requests and retrievals may be faster than on other types&#xD;
of networks, and since file exchanges do not travel through&#xD;
a server, communications can take place between any&#xD;
computers that remain connected to the network without&#xD;
risk that a glitch in the server will disable the network in&#xD;
its entirety. Given these benefits in security, cost, and&#xD;
efficiency, peer-to-peer networks are employed to store&#xD;
and distribute electronic files by universities, government&#xD;
agencies, corporations, and libraries, among others.1&#xD;
   Other users of peer-to-peer networks include individual&#xD;
recipients of Grokster’s and StreamCast’s software, and&#xD;
although the networks that they enjoy through using the&#xD;
software can be used to share any type of digital file, they&#xD;
have prominently employed those networks in sharing&#xD;
copyrighted music and video files without authorization.&#xD;
A group of copyright holders (MGM for short, but includ-&#xD;
ing motion picture studios, recording companies, song-&#xD;
writers, and music publishers) sued Grokster and&#xD;
StreamCast for their users’ copyright infringements,&#xD;
alleging that they knowingly and intentionally distributed&#xD;
their software to enable users to reproduce and distribute&#xD;
the copyrighted works in violation of the Copyright Act, 17&#xD;
U. S. C. §101 et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. II).2 MGM sought&#xD;
——————&#xD;
   1 Peer-to-peer networks have disadvantages as well.      Searches on&#xD;
peer-to-peer networks may not reach and uncover all available files&#xD;
because search requests may not be transmitted to every computer on&#xD;
the network. There may be redundant copies of popular files. The&#xD;
creator of the software has no incentive to minimize storage or band-&#xD;
width consumption, the costs of which are borne by every user of the&#xD;
network. Most relevant here, it is more difficult to control the content&#xD;
of files available for retrieval and the behavior of users.&#xD;
   2 The studios and recording companies and the songwriters and music&#xD;
&#xD;
publishers filed separate suits against the defendants that were con-&#xD;

&#xD;
                        Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
damages and an injunction.&#xD;
   Discovery during the litigation revealed the way the&#xD;
software worked, the business aims of each defendant&#xD;
company, and the predilections of the users. Grokster’s&#xD;
eponymous software employs what is known as FastTrack&#xD;
technology, a protocol developed by others and licensed to&#xD;
Grokster. StreamCast distributes a very similar product&#xD;
except that its software, called Morpheus, relies on what is&#xD;
known as Gnutella technology.3 A user who downloads&#xD;
and installs either software possesses the protocol to send&#xD;
requests for files directly to the computers of others using&#xD;
software compatible with FastTrack or Gnutella. On the&#xD;
FastTrack network opened by the Grokster software, the&#xD;
user’s request goes to a computer given an indexing capac-&#xD;
ity by the software and designated a supernode, or to some&#xD;
other computer with comparable power and capacity to&#xD;
collect temporary indexes of the files available on the&#xD;
computers of users connected to it. The supernode (or&#xD;
indexing computer) searches its own index and may com-&#xD;
municate the search request to other supernodes. If the&#xD;
file is found, the supernode discloses its location to the&#xD;
computer requesting it, and the requesting user can&#xD;
download the file directly from the computer located. The&#xD;
copied file is placed in a designated sharing folder on the&#xD;
requesting user’s computer, where it is available for other&#xD;
users to download in turn, along with any other file in that&#xD;
folder.&#xD;
   In the Gnutella network made available by Morpheus,&#xD;
the process is mostly the same, except that in some ver-&#xD;
sions of the Gnutella protocol there are no supernodes. In&#xD;
these versions, peer computers using the protocol commu-&#xD;
&#xD;
——————&#xD;
solidated by the District Court.&#xD;
  3 Subsequent versions of Morpheus, released after the record was&#xD;
&#xD;
made in this case, apparently rely not on Gnutella but on a technology&#xD;
called Neonet. These developments are not before us.&#xD;
4          METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER STUDIOS INC. v.&#xD;
                     GROKSTER, LTD.&#xD;
                    Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
nicate directly with each other. When a user enters a&#xD;
search request into the Morpheus software, it sends the&#xD;
request to computers connected with it, which in turn pass&#xD;
the request along to other connected peers. The search&#xD;
results are communicated to the requesting computer, and&#xD;
the user can download desired files directly from peers’&#xD;
computers. As this description indicates, Grokster and&#xD;
StreamCast use no servers to intercept the content of the&#xD;
search requests or to mediate the file transfers conducted&#xD;
by users of the software, there being no central point&#xD;
through which the substance of the communications&#xD;
passes in either direction.4&#xD;
  Although Grokster and StreamCast do not therefore&#xD;
know when particular files are copied, a few searches&#xD;
using their software would show what is available on the&#xD;
networks the software reaches. MGM commissioned a&#xD;
statistician to conduct a systematic search, and his study&#xD;
showed that nearly 90% of the files available for download&#xD;
on the FastTrack system were copyrighted works.5 Grok-&#xD;
ster and StreamCast dispute this figure, raising methodo-&#xD;
logical problems and arguing that free copying even of&#xD;
copyrighted works may be authorized by the rightholders.&#xD;
They also argue that potential noninfringing uses of their&#xD;
software are significant in kind, even if infrequent in&#xD;
practice. Some musical performers, for example, have&#xD;
gained new audiences by distributing their copyrighted&#xD;
works for free across peer-to-peer networks, and some&#xD;
&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  4 There is some evidence that both Grokster and StreamCast previ-&#xD;
&#xD;
ously operated supernodes, which compiled indexes of files available on&#xD;
all of the nodes connected to them. This evidence, pertaining to previ-&#xD;
ous versions of the defendants’ software, is not before us and would not&#xD;
affect our conclusions in any event.&#xD;
  5 By comparison, evidence introduced by the plaintiffs in A &amp; M Re-&#xD;
&#xD;
cords, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F. 3d 1004 (CA9 2001), showed that&#xD;
87% of files available on the Napster filesharing network were copy-&#xD;
righted, id., at 1013.&#xD;
                   Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                 5&#xD;
&#xD;
                        Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
distributors of unprotected content have used peer-to-peer&#xD;
networks to disseminate files, Shakespeare being an&#xD;
example. Indeed, StreamCast has given Morpheus users&#xD;
the opportunity to download the briefs in this very case,&#xD;
though their popularity has not been quantified.&#xD;
  As for quantification, the parties’ anecdotal and statisti-&#xD;
cal evidence entered thus far to show the content available&#xD;
on the FastTrack and Gnutella networks does not say&#xD;
much about which files are actually downloaded by users,&#xD;
and no one can say how often the software is used to ob-&#xD;
tain copies of unprotected material. But MGM’s evidence&#xD;
gives reason to think that the vast majority of users’&#xD;
downloads are acts of infringement, and because well over&#xD;
100 million copies of the software in question are known to&#xD;
have been downloaded, and billions of files are shared&#xD;
across the FastTrack and Gnutella networks each month,&#xD;
the probable scope of copyright infringement is staggering.&#xD;
  Grokster and StreamCast concede the infringement in&#xD;
most downloads, Brief for Respondents 10, n. 6, and it is&#xD;
uncontested that they are aware that users employ their&#xD;
software primarily to download copyrighted files, even if&#xD;
the decentralized FastTrack and Gnutella networks fail to&#xD;
reveal which files are being copied, and when. From time&#xD;
to time, moreover, the companies have learned about their&#xD;
users’ infringement directly, as from users who have sent&#xD;
e-mail to each company with questions about playing&#xD;
copyrighted movies they had downloaded, to whom the&#xD;
companies have responded with guidance.6 App. 559–563,&#xD;
808–816, 939–954. And MGM notified the companies of 8&#xD;
million copyrighted files that could be obtained using their&#xD;
software.&#xD;
  Grokster and StreamCast are not, however, merely&#xD;
passive recipients of information about infringing use.&#xD;

  6 The Grokster founder contends that in answering these e-mails he&#xD;
&#xD;
often did not read them fully. App. 77, 769.&#xD;

                    GROKSTER, LTD.&#xD;
                   Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
The record is replete with evidence that from the moment&#xD;
Grokster and StreamCast began to distribute their free&#xD;
software, each one clearly voiced the objective that recipi-&#xD;
ents use it to download copyrighted works, and each took&#xD;
active steps to encourage infringement.&#xD;
   After the notorious file-sharing service, Napster, was&#xD;
sued by copyright holders for facilitation of copyright&#xD;
infringement, A &amp; M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;114&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
&lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;896&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;pre class="inline"&gt; (ND Cal. 2000), aff’d in part, rev’d in part,&#xD;
239 F. 3d 1004 (CA9 2001), StreamCast gave away a&#xD;
software program of a kind known as OpenNap, designed&#xD;
as compatible with the Napster program and open to&#xD;
Napster users for downloading files from other Napster&#xD;
and OpenNap users’ computers. Evidence indicates that&#xD;
“[i]t was always [StreamCast’s] intent to use [its OpenNap&#xD;
network] to be able to capture email addresses of [its]&#xD;
initial target market so that [it] could promote [its]&#xD;
StreamCast Morpheus interface to them,” App. 861; in-&#xD;
deed, the OpenNap program was engineered “ ‘to leverage&#xD;
Napster’s 50 million user base,’ ” id., at 746.&#xD;
   StreamCast monitored both the number of users&#xD;
downloading its OpenNap program and the number of&#xD;
music files they downloaded. Id., at 859, 863, 866. It also&#xD;
used the resulting OpenNap network to distribute copies&#xD;
of the Morpheus software and to encourage users to adopt&#xD;
it. Id., at 861, 867, 1039. Internal company documents&#xD;
indicate that StreamCast hoped to attract large numbers&#xD;
of former Napster users if that company was shut down by&#xD;
court order or otherwise, and that StreamCast planned to&#xD;
be the next Napster. Id., at 861. A kit developed by&#xD;
StreamCast to be delivered to advertisers, for example,&#xD;
contained press articles about StreamCast’s potential to&#xD;
capture former Napster users, id., at 568–572, and it&#xD;
introduced itself to some potential advertisers as a com-&#xD;
pany “which is similar to what Napster was,” id., at 884.&#xD;
It broadcast banner advertisements to users of other&#xD;
                     Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                   7&#xD;
&#xD;
                         Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
Napster-compatible software, urging them to adopt its&#xD;
OpenNap. Id., at 586. An internal e-mail from a company&#xD;
executive stated: “ ‘We have put this network in place so&#xD;
that when Napster pulls the plug on their free service . . .&#xD;
or if the Court orders them shut down prior to that . . . we&#xD;
will be positioned to capture the flood of their 32 million&#xD;
users that will be actively looking for an alternative.’ ” Id.,&#xD;
at 588–589, 861.&#xD;
    Thus, StreamCast developed promotional materials to&#xD;
market its service as the best Napster alternative. One&#xD;
proposed advertisement read: “Napster Inc. has an-&#xD;
nounced that it will soon begin charging you a fee. That’s&#xD;
if the courts don’t order it shut down first. What will you&#xD;
do to get around it?” Id., at 897. Another proposed ad&#xD;
touted StreamCast’s software as the “#1 alternative to&#xD;
Napster” and asked “[w]hen the lights went off at Napster&#xD;
. . . where did the users go?” Id., at 836 (ellipsis in origi-&#xD;
nal).7 StreamCast even planned to flaunt the illegal uses&#xD;
of its software; when it launched the OpenNap network,&#xD;
the chief technology officer of the company averred that&#xD;
“[t]he goal is to get in trouble with the law and get sued.&#xD;
It’s the best way to get in the new[s].” Id., at 916.&#xD;
    The evidence that Grokster sought to capture the mar-&#xD;
ket of former Napster users is sparser but revealing, for&#xD;
Grokster launched its own OpenNap system called Swap-&#xD;
tor and inserted digital codes into its Web site so that&#xD;
computer users using Web search engines to look for&#xD;
“Napster” or “[f]ree filesharing” would be directed to the&#xD;
Grokster Web site, where they could download the Grok-&#xD;
ster software. Id., at 992–993. And Grokster’s name is an&#xD;
apparent derivative of Napster.&#xD;
&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  7 The record makes clear that StreamCast developed these promo-&#xD;
tional materials but not whether it released them to the public. Even if&#xD;
these advertisements were not released to the public and do not show&#xD;
encouragement to infringe, they illuminate StreamCast’s purposes.&#xD;
8        METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER STUDIOS INC. v.&#xD;
                   GROKSTER, LTD.&#xD;
                  Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
   StreamCast’s executives monitored the number of songs&#xD;
by certain commercial artists available on their networks,&#xD;
and an internal communication indicates they aimed to&#xD;
have a larger number of copyrighted songs available on&#xD;
their networks than other file-sharing networks. Id., at&#xD;
868. The point, of course, would be to attract users of a&#xD;
mind to infringe, just as it would be with their promo-&#xD;
tional materials developed showing copyrighted songs as&#xD;
examples of the kinds of files available through Morpheus.&#xD;
Id., at 848. Morpheus in fact allowed users to search&#xD;
specifically for “Top 40” songs, id., at 735, which were&#xD;
inevitably copyrighted. Similarly, Grokster sent users a&#xD;
newsletter promoting its ability to provide particular,&#xD;
popular copyrighted materials. Brief for Motion Picture&#xD;
Studio and Recording Company Petitioners 7–8.&#xD;
   In addition to this evidence of express promotion, mar-&#xD;
keting, and intent to promote further, the business models&#xD;
employed by Grokster and StreamCast confirm that their&#xD;
principal object was use of their software to download&#xD;
copyrighted works. Grokster and StreamCast receive no&#xD;
revenue from users, who obtain the software itself for&#xD;
nothing. Instead, both companies generate income by&#xD;
selling advertising space, and they stream the advertising&#xD;
to Grokster and Morpheus users while they are employing&#xD;
the programs. As the number of users of each program&#xD;
increases, advertising opportunities become worth more.&#xD;
Cf. App. 539, 804. While there is doubtless some demand&#xD;
for free Shakespeare, the evidence shows that substantive&#xD;
volume is a function of free access to copyrighted work.&#xD;
Users seeking Top 40 songs, for example, or the latest&#xD;
release by Modest Mouse, are certain to be far more nu-&#xD;
merous than those seeking a free Decameron, and Grok-&#xD;
ster and StreamCast translated that demand into dollars.&#xD;
   Finally, there is no evidence that either company made&#xD;
an effort to filter copyrighted material from users’&#xD;
downloads or otherwise impede the sharing of copyrighted&#xD;
                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            9&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
files. Although Grokster appears to have sent e-mails&#xD;
warning users about infringing content when it received&#xD;
threatening notice from the copyright holders, it never&#xD;
blocked anyone from continuing to use its software to&#xD;
share copyrighted files. Id., at 75–76. StreamCast not&#xD;
only rejected another company’s offer of help to monitor&#xD;
infringement, id., at 928–929, but blocked the Internet&#xD;
Protocol addresses of entities it believed were trying to&#xD;
engage in such monitoring on its networks, id., at 917–&#xD;
922.&#xD;
                              B&#xD;
   After discovery, the parties on each side of the case&#xD;
cross-moved for summary judgment. The District Court&#xD;
limited its consideration to the asserted liability of Grok-&#xD;
ster and StreamCast for distributing the current versions&#xD;
of their software, leaving aside whether either was liable&#xD;
“for damages arising from past versions of their software,&#xD;
or from other past activities.” &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;259&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F. Supp. 2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1029&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;pre class="inline"&gt;, 1033&#xD;
(CD Cal. 2003). The District Court held that those who&#xD;
used the Grokster and Morpheus software to download&#xD;
copyrighted media files directly infringed MGM’s copy-&#xD;
rights, a conclusion not contested on appeal, but the court&#xD;
nonetheless granted summary judgment in favor of Grok-&#xD;
ster and StreamCast as to any liability arising from dis-&#xD;
tribution of the then current versions of their software.&#xD;
Distributing that software gave rise to no liability in the&#xD;
court’s view, because its use did not provide the distribu-&#xD;
tors with actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement.&#xD;
Case No. CV 01 08541 SVW (PJWx) (CD Cal., June 18,&#xD;
2003), App. 1213.&#xD;
   The Court of Appeals affirmed. 380 F. 3d 1154 (CA9&#xD;
2004). In the court’s analysis, a defendant was liable as a&#xD;
contributory infringer when it had knowledge of direct&#xD;
infringement and materially contributed to the infringe-&#xD;
ment. But the court read Sony Corp. of America v. Uni-&#xD;
10       METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER STUDIOS INC. v.&#xD;
                   GROKSTER, LTD.&#xD;
                  Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
versal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417 (1984), as holding&#xD;
that distribution of a commercial product capable of sub-&#xD;
stantial noninfringing uses could not give rise to contribu-&#xD;
tory liability for infringement unless the distributor had&#xD;
actual knowledge of specific instances of infringement and&#xD;
failed to act on that knowledge. The fact that the software&#xD;
was capable of substantial noninfringing uses in the Ninth&#xD;
Circuit’s view meant that Grokster and StreamCast were&#xD;
not liable, because they had no such actual knowledge,&#xD;
owing to the decentralized architecture of their software.&#xD;
The court also held that Grokster and StreamCast did not&#xD;
materially contribute to their users’ infringement because&#xD;
it was the users themselves who searched for, retrieved,&#xD;
and stored the infringing files, with no involvement by the&#xD;
defendants beyond providing the software in the first&#xD;
place.&#xD;
   The Ninth Circuit also considered whether Grokster and&#xD;
StreamCast could be liable under a theory of vicarious&#xD;
infringement. The court held against liability because the&#xD;
defendants did not monitor or control the use of the soft-&#xD;
ware, had no agreed-upon right or current ability to su-&#xD;
pervise its use, and had no independent duty to police&#xD;
infringement. We granted certiorari. 543 U. S. ___ (2004).&#xD;

   MGM and many of the amici fault the Court of Ap-&#xD;
peals’s holding for upsetting a sound balance between the&#xD;
respective values of supporting creative pursuits through&#xD;
copyright protection and promoting innovation in new&#xD;
communication technologies by limiting the incidence of&#xD;
liability for copyright infringement. The more artistic&#xD;
protection is favored, the more technological innovation&#xD;
may be discouraged; the administration of copyright law is&#xD;
an exercise in managing the trade-off. See Sony Corp. v.&#xD;

   The tension between the two values is the subject of this&#xD;
case, with its claim that digital distribution of copyrighted&#xD;
material threatens copyright holders as never before,&#xD;
because every copy is identical to the original, copying is&#xD;
easy, and many people (especially the young) use file-&#xD;
sharing software to download copyrighted works. This&#xD;
very breadth of the software’s use may well draw the&#xD;
public directly into the debate over copyright policy, Pe-&#xD;
ters, Brace Memorial Lecture: Copyright Enters the Public&#xD;
Domain, 51 J. Copyright Soc. 701, 705–717 (2004) (address&#xD;

the ease of copying songs or movies using software like&#xD;
Grokster’s and Napster’s is fostering disdain for copyright&#xD;
protection, Wu, When Code Isn’t Law, 89 Va. L. Rev. 679,&#xD;
724–726 (2003). As the case has been presented to us,&#xD;
these fears are said to be offset by the different concern&#xD;
that imposing liability, not only on infringers but on dis-&#xD;
tributors of software based on its potential for unlawful&#xD;
use, could limit further development of beneficial tech-&#xD;
nologies. See, e.g., Lemley &amp; Reese, Reducing Digital&#xD;

——————&#xD;
  8 The mutual exclusivity of these values should not be overstated,&#xD;
&#xD;
however. On the one hand technological innovators, including those&#xD;
writing filesharing computer programs, may wish for effective copyright&#xD;
protections for their work. See, e.g., Wu, When Code Isn’t Law, 89 Va.&#xD;
L. Rev. 679, 750 (2003). (StreamCast itself was urged by an associate&#xD;

                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
   The argument for imposing indirect liability in this case&#xD;
is, however, a powerful one, given the number of infring-&#xD;
ing downloads that occur every day using StreamCast’s&#xD;
and Grokster’s software. When a widely shared service or&#xD;
product is used to commit infringement, it may be impos-&#xD;
sible to enforce rights in the protected work effectively&#xD;
against all direct infringers, the only practical alternative&#xD;
being to go against the distributor of the copying device for&#xD;
secondary liability on a theory of contributory or vicarious&#xD;
infringement. See In re Aimster Copyright Litigation, 334&#xD;
F. 3d 643, 645–646 (CA7 2003).&#xD;
   One infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or&#xD;
encouraging direct infringement, see Gershwin Pub. Corp.&#xD;
v. Columbia Artists Management, Inc., 443 F. 2d 1159,&#xD;
1162 (CA2 1971), and infringes vicariously by profiting&#xD;
from direct infringement while declining to exercise a&#xD;
right to stop or limit it, Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co. v. H. L.&#xD;

of creative works through improved technologies may enable the&#xD;
synthesis of new works or generate audiences for emerging artists. See&#xD;
Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U. S. 186, 223–226 (2003) (STEVENS, J., dissent-&#xD;

    9 We stated in Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,&#xD;
&#xD;
464 U. S. 417 (1984), that “ ‘the lines between direct infringement,&#xD;
contributory infringement and vicarious liability are not clearly drawn’&#xD;
. . . . [R]easoned analysis of [the Sony plaintiffs’ contributory infringe-&#xD;
ment claim] necessarily entails consideration of arguments and case&#xD;
law which may also be forwarded under the other labels, and indeed&#xD;
the parties . . . rely upon such arguments and authority in support of&#xD;
their respective positions on the issue of contributory infringement,”&#xD;
id., at 435, n. 17 (quoting Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Sony Corp.,&#xD;

has argued a vicarious liability theory, which allows imposition of&#xD;
liability when the defendant profits directly from the infringement and&#xD;
has a right and ability to supervise the direct infringer, even if the&#xD;

&#xD;
“[t]he Copyright Act does not expressly render anyone&#xD;
liable for infringement committed by another,” Sony Corp.&#xD;
v. Universal City Studios, 464 U. S., at 434, these doc-&#xD;
trines of secondary liability emerged from common law&#xD;
principles and are well established in the law, id., at 486&#xD;
(Blackmun, J., dissenting); Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers,&#xD;
222 U. S. 55, 62–63 (1911); Gershwin Pub. Corp. v. Co-&#xD;

                                 B&#xD;
    Despite the currency of these principles of secondary&#xD;
liability, this Court has dealt with secondary copyright&#xD;
infringement in only one recent case, and because MGM&#xD;
has tailored its principal claim to our opinion there, a look&#xD;
at our earlier holding is in order. In Sony Corp. v. Univer-&#xD;
sal City Studios, supra, this Court addressed a claim that&#xD;
secondary liability for infringement can arise from the&#xD;
very distribution of a commercial product. There, the&#xD;
product, novel at the time, was what we know today as the&#xD;
videocassette recorder or VCR. Copyright holders sued&#xD;
Sony as the manufacturer, claiming it was contributorily&#xD;
liable for infringement that occurred when VCR owners&#xD;
taped copyrighted programs because it supplied the means&#xD;
used to infringe, and it had constructive knowledge that&#xD;
infringement would occur. At the trial on the merits, the&#xD;
evidence showed that the principal use of the VCR was for&#xD;
“ ‘time-shifting,’ ” or taping a program for later viewing at a&#xD;
more convenient time, which the Court found to be a fair,&#xD;
not an infringing, use. Id., at 423–424. There was no&#xD;
——————&#xD;
defendant initially lacks knowledge of the infringement. See, e.g.,&#xD;
Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co. v. H. L. Green Co., 316 F. 2d 304, 308 (CA2&#xD;
1963); Dreamland Ball Room, Inc. v. Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co., 36 F. 2d&#xD;
354, 355 (CA7 1929). Because we resolve the case based on an induce-&#xD;
ment theory, there is no need to analyze separately MGM’s vicarious&#xD;
liability theory.&#xD;
14       METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER STUDIOS INC. v.&#xD;
                   GROKSTER, LTD.&#xD;
                  Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
evidence that Sony had expressed an object of bringing&#xD;
about taping in violation of copyright or had taken active&#xD;
steps to increase its profits from unlawful taping. Id., at&#xD;
438. Although Sony’s advertisements urged consumers to&#xD;
buy the VCR to “ ‘record favorite shows’ ” or “ ‘build a li-&#xD;
brary’ ” of recorded programs, id., at 459 (Blackmun, J.,&#xD;
dissenting), neither of these uses was necessarily infring-&#xD;
ing, id., at 424, 454–455.&#xD;
   On those facts, with no evidence of stated or indicated&#xD;
intent to promote infringing uses, the only conceivable&#xD;
basis for imposing liability was on a theory of contributory&#xD;
infringement arising from its sale of VCRs to consumers&#xD;
with knowledge that some would use them to infringe. Id.,&#xD;
at 439. But because the VCR was “capable of commer-&#xD;
cially significant noninfringing uses,” we held the manu-&#xD;
facturer could not be faulted solely on the basis of its&#xD;
distribution. Id., at 442.&#xD;
   This analysis reflected patent law’s traditional staple&#xD;
article of commerce doctrine, now codified, that distribu-&#xD;
tion of a component of a patented device will not violate&#xD;
the patent if it is suitable for use in other ways. 35&#xD;
U. S. C. §271(c); Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replace-&#xD;
ment Co., 377 U. S. 476, 485 (1964) (noting codification of&#xD;
cases); id., at 486, n. 6 (same). The doctrine was devised&#xD;
to identify instances in which it may be presumed from&#xD;
distribution of an article in commerce that the distributor&#xD;
intended the article to be used to infringe another’s pat-&#xD;
ent, and so may justly be held liable for that infringement.&#xD;
“One who makes and sells articles which are only adapted&#xD;
to be used in a patented combination will be presumed to&#xD;
intend the natural consequences of his acts; he will be&#xD;
presumed to intend that they shall be used in the combi-&#xD;
nation of the patent.” New York Scaffolding Co. v. Whit-&#xD;

   In sum, where an article is “good for nothing else” but&#xD;
infringement, Canda v. Michigan Malleable Iron Co.,&#xD;
supra, at 489, there is no legitimate public interest in its&#xD;
unlicensed availability, and there is no injustice in pre-&#xD;
suming or imputing an intent to infringe, see Henry v.&#xD;
A. B. Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1, 48 (1912), overruled on other&#xD;
grounds, Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film&#xD;
Mfg. Co., 243 U. S. 502 (1917). Conversely, the doctrine&#xD;
absolves the equivocal conduct of selling an item with&#xD;
substantial lawful as well as unlawful uses, and limits&#xD;
liability to instances of more acute fault than the mere&#xD;
understanding that some of one’s products will be mis-&#xD;
used. It leaves breathing room for innovation and a vigor-&#xD;
ous commerce. See Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios,&#xD;
supra, at 442; Dawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm &amp; Haas Co.,&#xD;
448 U. S. 176, 221 (1980); Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., supra,&#xD;
at 48.&#xD;
   The parties and many of the amici in this case think the&#xD;
key to resolving it is the Sony rule and, in particular, what&#xD;
it means for a product to be “capable of commercially&#xD;
significant noninfringing uses.” Sony Corp. v. Universal&#xD;
City Studios, supra, at 442. MGM advances the argument&#xD;
that granting summary judgment to Grokster and&#xD;
StreamCast as to their current activities gave too much&#xD;
weight to the value of innovative technology, and too little&#xD;
to the copyrights infringed by users of their software,&#xD;
given that 90% of works available on one of the networks&#xD;
was shown to be copyrighted. Assuming the remaining&#xD;
10% to be its noninfringing use, MGM says this should not&#xD;
qualify as “substantial,” and the Court should quantify&#xD;
Sony to the extent of holding that a product used “princi-&#xD;
16        METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER STUDIOS INC. v.&#xD;
                    GROKSTER, LTD.&#xD;
                   Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
pally” for infringement does not qualify. See Brief for&#xD;
Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners&#xD;
31. As mentioned before, Grokster and StreamCast reply&#xD;
by citing evidence that their software can be used to re-&#xD;
produce public domain works, and they point to copyright&#xD;
holders who actually encourage copying. Even if in-&#xD;
fringement is the principal practice with their software&#xD;
today, they argue, the noninfringing uses are significant&#xD;
and will grow.&#xD;
   We agree with MGM that the Court of Appeals misap-&#xD;
plied Sony, which it read as limiting secondary liability&#xD;
quite beyond the circumstances to which the case applied.&#xD;
Sony barred secondary liability based on presuming or&#xD;
imputing intent to cause infringement solely from the&#xD;
design or distribution of a product capable of substantial&#xD;
lawful use, which the distributor knows is in fact used for&#xD;
infringement. The Ninth Circuit has read Sony’s limita-&#xD;
tion to mean that whenever a product is capable of sub-&#xD;
stantial lawful use, the producer can never be held con-&#xD;
tributorily liable for third parties’ infringing use of it; it&#xD;
read the rule as being this broad, even when an actual&#xD;
purpose to cause infringing use is shown by evidence&#xD;
independent of design and distribution of the product,&#xD;
unless the distributors had “specific knowledge of in-&#xD;
fringement at a time at which they contributed to the&#xD;
infringement, and failed to act upon that information.”&#xD;
380 F. 3d, at 1162 (internal quotation marks and altera-&#xD;
tions omitted). Because the Circuit found the StreamCast&#xD;
and Grokster software capable of substantial lawful use, it&#xD;
concluded on the basis of its reading of Sony that neither&#xD;
company could be held liable, since there was no showing&#xD;
that their software, being without any central server,&#xD;
afforded them knowledge of specific unlawful uses.&#xD;
   This view of Sony, however, was error, converting the&#xD;
case from one about liability resting on imputed intent to&#xD;
one about liability on any theory. Because Sony did not&#xD;
                    Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                  17&#xD;
&#xD;
                         Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
displace other theories of secondary liability, and because&#xD;
we find below that it was error to grant summary judg-&#xD;
ment to the companies on MGM’s inducement claim, we&#xD;
do not revisit Sony further, as MGM requests, to add a&#xD;
more quantified description of the point of balance be-&#xD;
tween protection and commerce when liability rests solely&#xD;
on distribution with knowledge that unlawful use will&#xD;
occur. It is enough to note that the Ninth Circuit’s judg-&#xD;
ment rested on an erroneous understanding of Sony and to&#xD;
leave further consideration of the Sony rule for a day when&#xD;
that may be required.&#xD;
                              C&#xD;
  Sony’s rule limits imputing culpable intent as a matter&#xD;
of law from the characteristics or uses of a distributed&#xD;
product. But nothing in Sony requires courts to ignore&#xD;
evidence of intent if there is such evidence, and the case&#xD;
was never meant to foreclose rules of fault-based liability&#xD;
derived from the common law.10 Sony Corp. v. Universal&#xD;
City Studios, 464 U. S., at 439 (“If vicarious liability is to&#xD;
be imposed on Sony in this case, it must rest on the fact&#xD;
that it has sold equipment with constructive knowledge” of&#xD;
the potential for infringement). Thus, where evidence&#xD;
goes beyond a product’s characteristics or the knowledge&#xD;
that it may be put to infringing uses, and shows state-&#xD;
ments or actions directed to promoting infringement,&#xD;
Sony’s staple-article rule will not preclude liability.&#xD;
  The classic case of direct evidence of unlawful purpose&#xD;
occurs when one induces commission of infringement by&#xD;
another, or “entic[es] or persuad[es] another” to infringe,&#xD;
Black’s Law Dictionary 790 (8th ed. 2004), as by advertis-&#xD;
ing. Thus at common law a copyright or patent defendant&#xD;
&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  10 Nor does the Patent Act’s exemption from liability for those who&#xD;
&#xD;
distribute a staple article of commerce, 35 U. S. C. §271(c), extend to&#xD;
those who induce patent infringement, §271(b).&#xD;

activity along with “avowals of the [infringing] purpose&#xD;
and use for which it was made” supported liability for&#xD;
patent infringement).&#xD;
   The rule on inducement of infringement as developed in&#xD;
the early cases is no different today.11 Evidence of “active&#xD;
steps . . . taken to encourage direct infringement,” Oak&#xD;

show an affirmative intent that the product be used to&#xD;
infringe, and a showing that infringement was encouraged&#xD;
overcomes the law’s reluctance to find liability when a&#xD;
defendant merely sells a commercial product suitable for&#xD;
some lawful use, see, e.g., Water Technologies Corp. v.&#xD;

morally wrong”).&#xD;
   For the same reasons that Sony took the staple-article&#xD;
doctrine of patent law as a model for its copyright safe-&#xD;
harbor rule, the inducement rule, too, is a sensible one for&#xD;
copyright. We adopt it here, holding that one who distrib-&#xD;
utes a device with the object of promoting its use to in-&#xD;
fringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other&#xD;
affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for&#xD;
the resulting acts of infringement by third parties. We&#xD;
are, of course, mindful of the need to keep from trenching&#xD;
on regular commerce or discouraging the development of&#xD;
technologies with lawful and unlawful potential. Accord-&#xD;
ingly, just as Sony did not find intentional inducement&#xD;
despite the knowledge of the VCR manufacturer that its&#xD;
device could be used to infringe, 464 U. S., at 439, n. 19,&#xD;
mere knowledge of infringing potential or of actual infring-&#xD;
ing uses would not be enough here to subject a distributor&#xD;
to liability. Nor would ordinary acts incident to product&#xD;
distribution, such as offering customers technical support&#xD;
or product updates, support liability in themselves. The&#xD;
inducement rule, instead, premises liability on purposeful,&#xD;
culpable expression and conduct, and thus does nothing to&#xD;

                            III&#xD;
                             A&#xD;
   The only apparent question about treating MGM’s&#xD;
evidence as sufficient to withstand summary judgment&#xD;
under the theory of inducement goes to the need on&#xD;
MGM’s part to adduce evidence that StreamCast and&#xD;
Grokster communicated an inducing message to their&#xD;
software users. The classic instance of inducement is by&#xD;
advertisement or solicitation that broadcasts a message&#xD;
designed to stimulate others to commit violations. MGM&#xD;
claims that such a message is shown here. It is undis-&#xD;
puted that StreamCast beamed onto the computer screens&#xD;
of users of Napster-compatible programs ads urging the&#xD;
adoption of its OpenNap program, which was designed, as&#xD;
its name implied, to invite the custom of patrons of Nap-&#xD;
ster, then under attack in the courts for facilitating mas-&#xD;
sive infringement. Those who accepted StreamCast’s&#xD;
OpenNap program were offered software to perform the&#xD;
same services, which a factfinder could conclude would&#xD;
readily have been understood in the Napster market as&#xD;
the ability to download copyrighted music files. Grokster&#xD;
distributed an electronic newsletter containing links to&#xD;
articles promoting its software’s ability to access popular&#xD;
copyrighted music. And anyone whose Napster or free&#xD;
file-sharing searches turned up a link to Grokster would&#xD;
have understood Grokster to be offering the same file-&#xD;
sharing ability as Napster, and to the same people who&#xD;
probably used Napster for infringing downloads; that&#xD;
would also have been the understanding of anyone offered&#xD;
Grokster’s suggestively named Swaptor software, its&#xD;
version of OpenNap. And both companies communicated a&#xD;
clear message by responding affirmatively to requests for&#xD;
help in locating and playing copyrighted materials.&#xD;
                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           21&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
   In StreamCast’s case, of course, the evidence just de-&#xD;
scribed was supplemented by other unequivocal indica-&#xD;
tions of unlawful purpose in the internal communications&#xD;
and advertising designs aimed at Napster users (“When&#xD;
the lights went off at Napster . . . where did the users go?”&#xD;
App. 836 (ellipsis in original)). Whether the messages&#xD;
were communicated is not to the point on this record. The&#xD;
function of the message in the theory of inducement is to&#xD;
prove by a defendant’s own statements that his unlawful&#xD;
purpose disqualifies him from claiming protection (and&#xD;
incidentally to point to actual violators likely to be found&#xD;
among those who hear or read the message). See supra, at&#xD;
17–19. Proving that a message was sent out, then, is the&#xD;
preeminent but not exclusive way of showing that active&#xD;
steps were taken with the purpose of bringing about in-&#xD;
fringing acts, and of showing that infringing acts took&#xD;
place by using the device distributed. Here, the summary&#xD;
judgment record is replete with other evidence that Grok-&#xD;
ster and StreamCast, unlike the manufacturer and dis-&#xD;
tributor in Sony, acted with a purpose to cause copyright&#xD;
violations by use of software suitable for illegal use. See&#xD;
supra, at 6–9.&#xD;
   Three features of this evidence of intent are particularly&#xD;
notable. First, each company showed itself to be aiming to&#xD;
satisfy a known source of demand for copyright infringe-&#xD;
ment, the market comprising former Napster users.&#xD;
StreamCast’s internal documents made constant reference&#xD;
to Napster, it initially distributed its Morpheus software&#xD;
through an OpenNap program compatible with Napster, it&#xD;
advertised its OpenNap program to Napster users, and its&#xD;
Morpheus software functions as Napster did except that it&#xD;
could be used to distribute more kinds of files, including&#xD;
copyrighted movies and software programs. Grokster’s&#xD;
name is apparently derived from Napster, it too initially&#xD;
offered an OpenNap program, its software’s function is&#xD;
likewise comparable to Napster’s, and it attempted to&#xD;
22         METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER STUDIOS INC. v.&#xD;
                     GROKSTER, LTD.&#xD;
                    Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
divert queries for Napster onto its own Web site. Grokster&#xD;
and StreamCast’s efforts to supply services to former&#xD;
Napster users, deprived of a mechanism to copy and dis-&#xD;
tribute what were overwhelmingly infringing files, indi-&#xD;
cate a principal, if not exclusive, intent on the part of each&#xD;
to bring about infringement.&#xD;
   Second, this evidence of unlawful objective is given&#xD;
added significance by MGM’s showing that neither com-&#xD;
pany attempted to develop filtering tools or other mecha-&#xD;
nisms to diminish the infringing activity using their soft-&#xD;
ware. While the Ninth Circuit treated the defendants’&#xD;
failure to develop such tools as irrelevant because they&#xD;
lacked an independent duty to monitor their users’ activ-&#xD;
ity, we think this evidence underscores Grokster’s and&#xD;
StreamCast’s intentional facilitation of their users’ in-&#xD;
fringement.12&#xD;
   Third, there is a further complement to the direct evi-&#xD;
dence of unlawful objective. It is useful to recall that&#xD;
StreamCast and Grokster make money by selling advertis-&#xD;
ing space, by directing ads to the screens of computers&#xD;
employing their software. As the record shows, the more&#xD;
the software is used, the more ads are sent out and the&#xD;
greater the advertising revenue becomes. Since the extent&#xD;
of the software’s use determines the gain to the distribu-&#xD;
tors, the commercial sense of their enterprise turns on&#xD;
high-volume use, which the record shows is infringing.13&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  12 Of course, in the absence of other evidence of intent, a court would&#xD;
be unable to find contributory infringement liability merely based on a&#xD;
failure to take affirmative steps to prevent infringement, if the device&#xD;
otherwise was capable of substantial noninfringing uses. Such a&#xD;
holding would tread too close to the Sony safe harbor.&#xD;
  13 Grokster and StreamCast contend that any theory of liability based&#xD;
&#xD;
on their conduct is not properly before this Court because the rulings in&#xD;
the trial and appellate courts dealt only with the present versions of&#xD;
their software, not “past acts . . . that allegedly encouraged infringe-&#xD;
ment or assisted . . . known acts of infringement.” Brief for Respon-&#xD;
dents 14; see also id., at 34. This contention misapprehends the basis&#xD;
                      Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                    23&#xD;
&#xD;
                          Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
This evidence alone would not justify an inference of&#xD;
unlawful intent, but viewed in the context of the entire&#xD;
record its import is clear.&#xD;
  The unlawful objective is unmistakable.&#xD;
                             B&#xD;
  In addition to intent to bring about infringement and&#xD;
distribution of a device suitable for infringing use, the&#xD;
inducement theory of course requires evidence of actual&#xD;
infringement by recipients of the device, the software in&#xD;
this case. As the account of the facts indicates, there is&#xD;
evidence of infringement on a gigantic scale, and there is&#xD;
no serious issue of the adequacy of MGM’s showing on this&#xD;
point in order to survive the companies’ summary judg-&#xD;
ment requests. Although an exact calculation of infringing&#xD;
use, as a basis for a claim of damages, is subject to dis-&#xD;
pute, there is no question that the summary judgment&#xD;
evidence is at least adequate to entitle MGM to go forward&#xD;
with claims for damages and equitable relief.&#xD;
                         *     *    *&#xD;
  In sum, this case is significantly different from Sony and&#xD;
reliance on that case to rule in favor of StreamCast and&#xD;
Grokster was error. Sony dealt with a claim of liability&#xD;
based solely on distributing a product with alternative&#xD;
lawful and unlawful uses, with knowledge that some users&#xD;
would follow the unlawful course. The case struck a bal-&#xD;
——————&#xD;
for their potential liability. It is not only that encouraging a particular&#xD;
consumer to infringe a copyright can give rise to secondary liability for&#xD;
the infringement that results. Inducement liability goes beyond that,&#xD;
and the distribution of a product can itself give rise to liability where&#xD;
evidence shows that the distributor intended and encouraged the&#xD;
product to be used to infringe. In such a case, the culpable act is not&#xD;
merely the encouragement of infringement but also the distribution of&#xD;
the tool intended for infringing use. See Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers,&#xD;
222 U. S. 55, 62–63 (1911); Cable/Home Communication Corp. v.&#xD;

                   Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
ance between the interests of protection and innovation by&#xD;
holding that the product’s capability of substantial lawful&#xD;
employment should bar the imputation of fault and conse-&#xD;
quent secondary liability for the unlawful acts of others.&#xD;
   MGM’s evidence in this case most obviously addresses a&#xD;
different basis of liability for distributing a product open&#xD;
to alternative uses. Here, evidence of the distributors’&#xD;
words and deeds going beyond distribution as such shows&#xD;
a purpose to cause and profit from third-party acts of&#xD;
copyright infringement. If liability for inducing infringe-&#xD;
ment is ultimately found, it will not be on the basis of&#xD;
presuming or imputing fault, but from inferring a patently&#xD;
illegal objective from statements and actions showing&#xD;
what that objective was.&#xD;
   There is substantial evidence in MGM’s favor on all&#xD;
elements of inducement, and summary judgment in favor&#xD;
of Grokster and StreamCast was error. On remand, re-&#xD;
consideration of MGM’s motion for summary judgment&#xD;
will be in order.&#xD;
   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and&#xD;
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent&#xD;
with this opinion.&#xD;
                                              It is so ordered.&#xD;

City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417 (1984). There is here at&#xD;
least a “genuine issue as to [a] material fact,” Fed. Rule&#xD;
Civ. Proc. 56(c), on the liability of Grokster or StreamCast,&#xD;
not only for actively inducing copyright infringement, but&#xD;
also or alternatively, based on the distribution of their&#xD;
software products, for contributory copyright infringe-&#xD;
ment. On neither score was summary judgment for Grok-&#xD;
ster and StreamCast warranted.&#xD;
  At bottom, however labeled, the question in this case is&#xD;
whether Grokster and StreamCast are liable for the direct&#xD;
infringing acts of others. Liability under our jurispru-&#xD;
dence may be predicated on actively encouraging (or in-&#xD;
ducing) infringement through specific acts (as the Court’s&#xD;
opinion develops) or on distributing a product distributees&#xD;
use to infringe copyrights, if the product is not capable of&#xD;
“substantial” or “commercially significant” noninfringing&#xD;
uses. Sony, 464 U. S., at 442; see also 3 M. Nimmer &amp; D.&#xD;

&#xD;
the two categories overlap, they capture different culpable&#xD;
behavior. Long coexisting, both are now codified in patent&#xD;
law. Compare 35 U. S. C. §271(b) (active inducement&#xD;
liability), with §271(c) (contributory liability for distribu-&#xD;
tion of a product not “suitable for substantial noninfring-&#xD;
ing use”).&#xD;
   In Sony, 464 U. S. 417, the Court considered Sony’s&#xD;
liability for selling the Betamax video cassette recorder. It&#xD;
did so enlightened by a full trial record. Drawing an&#xD;
analogy to the staple article of commerce doctrine from&#xD;
patent law, the Sony Court observed that the “sale of an&#xD;
article . . . adapted to [a patent] infringing use” does not&#xD;
suffice “to make the seller a contributory infringer” if the&#xD;
article “is also adapted to other and lawful uses.” Id., at&#xD;
441 (quoting Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1, 48&#xD;
(1912), overruled on other grounds, Motion Picture Patents&#xD;
Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U. S. 502, 517 (1917)).&#xD;
   “The staple article of commerce doctrine” applied to&#xD;
copyright, the Court stated, “must strike a balance be-&#xD;
tween a copyright holder’s legitimate demand for effec-&#xD;
tive—not merely symbolic—protection of the statutory&#xD;
monopoly, and the rights of others freely to engage in&#xD;
substantially unrelated areas of commerce.” Sony, 464&#xD;
U. S., at 442. “Accordingly,” the Court held, “the sale of&#xD;
copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of com-&#xD;
merce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the&#xD;
product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable&#xD;
purposes. Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial&#xD;
noninfringing uses.” Ibid. Thus, to resolve the Sony case,&#xD;
the Court explained, it had to determine “whether the&#xD;
Betamax is capable of commercially significant noninfring-&#xD;
ing uses.” Ibid.&#xD;
   To answer that question, the Court considered whether&#xD;
“a significant number of [potential uses of the Betamax&#xD;
were] noninfringing.” Ibid. The Court homed in on one&#xD;
potential use—private, noncommercial time-shifting of&#xD;

&#xD;
television programs in the home (i.e., recording a broad-&#xD;
cast TV program for later personal viewing). Time-&#xD;
shifting was noninfringing, the Court concluded, because&#xD;
in some cases trial testimony showed it was authorized by&#xD;
the copyright holder, id., at 443–447, and in others it&#xD;
qualified as legitimate fair use, id., at 447–455. Most&#xD;
purchasers used the Betamax principally to engage in&#xD;
time-shifting, id., at 421, 423, a use that “plainly satis-&#xD;
fie[d]” the Court’s standard, id., at 442. Thus, there was&#xD;
no need in Sony to “give precise content to the question of&#xD;
how much [actual or potential] use is commercially signifi-&#xD;
cant.” Ibid.1 Further development was left for later days&#xD;

  1 JUSTICE  BREYER finds in Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Stu-&#xD;
dios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417 (1984), a “clear” rule permitting contributory&#xD;
liability for copyright infringement based on distribution of a product&#xD;
only when the product “will be used almost exclusively to infringe&#xD;
copyrights.” Post, at 9–10. But cf. Sony, 464 U. S., at 442 (recognizing&#xD;
“copyright holder’s legitimate demand for effective—not merely sym-&#xD;
bolic—protection”). Sony, as I read it, contains no clear, near-&#xD;
exclusivity test. Nor have Courts of Appeals unanimously recognized&#xD;
JUSTICE BREYER’s clear rule. Compare A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster,&#xD;
Inc., 239 F. 3d 1004, 1021 (CA9 2001) (“[E]vidence of actual knowledge&#xD;
of specific acts of infringement is required to hold a computer system&#xD;
operator liable for contributory copyright infringement.”), with In re&#xD;
Aimster Copyright Litigation, 334 F. 3d 643, 649–650 (CA7 2003)&#xD;
(“[W]hen a supplier is offering a product or service that has noninfring-&#xD;
ing as well as infringing uses, some estimate of the respective magni-&#xD;
tudes of these uses is necessary for a finding of contributory infringe-&#xD;
ment. . . . But the balancing of costs and benefits is necessary only in a&#xD;
case in which substantial noninfringing uses, present or prospective,&#xD;
are demonstrated.”). See also Matthew Bender &amp; Co., Inc. v. West Pub.&#xD;
Co., 158 F. 3d 693, 707 (CA2 1998) (“The Supreme Court applied [the&#xD;

&#xD;
and cases.&#xD;
   The Ninth Circuit went astray, I will endeavor to ex-&#xD;
plain, when that court granted summary judgment to&#xD;
Grokster and StreamCast on the charge of contributory&#xD;
liability based on distribution of their software products.&#xD;
Relying on its earlier opinion in A&amp;M Records, Inc. v.&#xD;
Napster, Inc., 239 F. 3d 1004 (CA9 2001), the Court of&#xD;
Appeals held that “if substantial noninfringing use was&#xD;
shown, the copyright owner would be required to show&#xD;
that the defendant had reasonable knowledge of specific&#xD;
infringing files.” 380 F. 3d 1154, 1161 (CA9 2004). “A&#xD;
careful examination of the record,” the court concluded,&#xD;
“indicates that there is no genuine issue of material fact as&#xD;
to noninfringing use.” Ibid. The appeals court pointed to&#xD;
the band Wilco, which made one of its albums available for&#xD;
free downloading, to other recording artists who may have&#xD;
authorized free distribution of their music through the&#xD;
Internet, and to public domain literary works and films&#xD;
available through Grokster’s and StreamCast’s software.&#xD;
Ibid. Although it acknowledged MGM’s assertion that&#xD;
“the vast majority of the software use is for copyright&#xD;
infringement,” the court concluded that Grokster’s and&#xD;
StreamCast’s proffered evidence met Sony’s requirement&#xD;
that “a product need only be capable of substantial nonin-&#xD;
fringing uses.” 380 F. 3d, at 1162.2&#xD;
   This case differs markedly from Sony. Cf. Peters, Brace&#xD;

gory, “quite beyond the circumstances to which the case applied.” Ante,&#xD;

  2 Grokster and StreamCast, in the Court of Appeals’ view, would be&#xD;
&#xD;
entitled to summary judgment unless MGM could show that that the&#xD;
software companies had knowledge of specific acts of infringement and&#xD;
failed to act on that knowledge—a standard the court held MGM could&#xD;
not meet. 380 F. 3d, at 1162–1163.&#xD;

. . . .”). Here, there has been no finding of any fair use and&#xD;
little beyond anecdotal evidence of noninfringing uses. In&#xD;
finding the Grokster and StreamCast software products&#xD;
capable of substantial noninfringing uses, the District Court&#xD;
and the Court of Appeals appear to have relied largely on&#xD;
declarations submitted by the defendants. These declara-&#xD;
tions include assertions (some of them hearsay) that a&#xD;
number of copyright owners authorize distribution of their&#xD;
works on the Internet and that some public domain material&#xD;
is available through peer-to-peer networks including those&#xD;
accessed through Grokster’s and StreamCast’s software.&#xD;

are substantial noninfringing uses for Defendants’ soft-&#xD;
ware,” thus obviating the need for further proceedings.&#xD;
259 F. Supp. 2d, at 1035. This conclusion appears to rest&#xD;
almost entirely on the collection of declarations submitted&#xD;
by Grokster and StreamCast. Ibid.            Review of these&#xD;
declarations reveals mostly anecdotal evidence, sometimes&#xD;
obtained second-hand, of authorized copyrighted works or&#xD;
public domain works available online and shared through&#xD;
peer-to-peer networks, and general statements about the&#xD;
benefits of peer-to-peer technology. See, e.g., Decl. of Janis&#xD;

judgment in the face of evidence, proffered by MGM, of&#xD;
overwhelming use of Grokster’s and StreamCast’s soft-&#xD;
ware for infringement.3&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  3 JUSTICE BREYER finds support for summary judgment in this motley&#xD;
&#xD;
collection of declarations and in a survey conducted by an expert&#xD;
retained by MGM. Post, at 4–8. That survey identified 75% of the files&#xD;
available through Grokster as copyrighted works owned or controlled&#xD;
by the plaintiffs, and 15% of the files as works likely copyrighted. App.&#xD;
                     Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                   7&#xD;
&#xD;
                       GINSBURG, J., concurring&#xD;
&#xD;
Even if the absolute number of noninfringing files copied&#xD;
using the Grokster and StreamCast software is large, it does&#xD;
not follow that the products are therefore put to substantial&#xD;
noninfringing uses and are thus immune from liability. The&#xD;
number of noninfringing copies may be reflective of, and&#xD;
dwarfed by, the huge total volume of files shared. Further,&#xD;
the District Court and the Court of Appeals did not sharply&#xD;
distinguish between uses of Grokster’s and StreamCast’s&#xD;
software products (which this case is about) and uses of&#xD;
peer-to-peer technology generally (which this case is not&#xD;
about).&#xD;
  In sum, when the record in this case was developed,&#xD;
there was evidence that Grokster’s and StreamCast’s&#xD;
products were, and had been for some time, overwhelm-&#xD;
ingly used to infringe, ante, at 4–6; App. 434–439, 476–&#xD;
481, and that this infringement was the overwhelming&#xD;
source of revenue from the products, ante, at 8–9; 259&#xD;
F. Supp. 2d, at 1043–1044. Fairly appraised, the evidence&#xD;
was insufficient to demonstrate, beyond genuine debate, a&#xD;
reasonable prospect that substantial or commercially&#xD;
significant noninfringing uses were likely to develop over&#xD;
——————&#xD;
439. As to the remaining 10% of the files, “there was not enough&#xD;
information to form reasonable conclusions either as to what those files&#xD;
even consisted of, and/or whether they were infringing or non-&#xD;
infringing.” App. 479. Even assuming, as JUSTICE BREYER does, that&#xD;
the Sony Court would have absolved Sony of contributory liability&#xD;
solely on the basis of the use of the Betamax for authorized time-&#xD;
shifting, post, at 3–4, summary judgment is not inevitably appropriate&#xD;
here. Sony stressed that the plaintiffs there owned “well below 10%” of&#xD;
copyrighted television programming, 464 U. S., at 443, and found,&#xD;
based on trial testimony from representatives of the four major sports&#xD;
leagues and other individuals authorized to consent to home-recording&#xD;
of their copyrighted broadcasts, that a similar percentage of program&#xD;
copying was authorized, id., at 424. Here, the plaintiffs allegedly&#xD;
control copyrights for 70% or 75% of the material exchanged through&#xD;
the Grokster and StreamCast software, 380 F. 3d, at 1158; App. 439,&#xD;
and the District Court does not appear to have relied on comparable&#xD;
testimony about authorized copying from copyright holders.&#xD;

time. On this record, the District Court should not have&#xD;
ruled dispositively on the contributory infringement&#xD;
charge by granting summary judgment to Grokster and&#xD;
StreamCast.4&#xD;
  If, on remand, the case is not resolved on summary&#xD;
judgment in favor of MGM based on Grokster and&#xD;
StreamCast actively inducing infringement, the Court of&#xD;
Appeals, I would emphasize, should reconsider, on a fuller&#xD;

&#xD;
  JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS and&#xD;
JUSTICE O’CONNOR join, concurring.&#xD;
  I agree with the Court that the distributor of a dual-use&#xD;
technology may be liable for the infringing activities of&#xD;
third parties where he or she actively seeks to advance the&#xD;
infringement. Ante, at 1. I further agree that, in light of&#xD;
our holding today, we need not now “revisit” Sony Corp. of&#xD;
America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417&#xD;
(1984). Ante, at 17. Other Members of the Court, how-&#xD;
ever, take up the Sony question: whether Grokster’s prod-&#xD;
uct is “capable of ‘substantial’ or ‘commercially significant’&#xD;
noninfringing uses.” Ante, at 1 (GINSBURG, J., concurring)&#xD;
(quoting Sony, supra, at 442). And they answer that&#xD;
question by stating that the Court of Appeals was wrong&#xD;
when it granted summary judgment on the issue in Grok-&#xD;
ster’s favor. Ante, at 4. I write to explain why I disagree&#xD;
with them on this matter.&#xD;
                            I&#xD;
  The Court’s opinion in Sony and the record evidence (as&#xD;
described and analyzed in the many briefs before us)&#xD;
together convince me that the Court of Appeals’ conclusion&#xD;
has adequate legal support.&#xD;
                           A&#xD;
  I begin with Sony’s standard. In Sony, the Court con-&#xD;

                  BREYER, J., concurring&#xD;
&#xD;
sidered the potential copyright liability of a company that&#xD;
did not itself illegally copy protected material, but rather&#xD;
sold a machine—a Video Cassette Recorder (VCR)—that&#xD;
could be used to do so. A buyer could use that machine for&#xD;
noninfringing purposes, such as recording for later view-&#xD;
ing (sometimes called “ ‘time-shifting,’ ” Sony, 464 U. S., at&#xD;
421) uncopyrighted television programs or copyrighted&#xD;
programs with a copyright holder’s permission. The buyer&#xD;
could use the machine for infringing purposes as well,&#xD;
such as building libraries of taped copyrighted programs.&#xD;
Or, the buyer might use the machine to record copyrighted&#xD;
programs under circumstances in which the legal status of&#xD;
the act of recording was uncertain (i.e., where the copying&#xD;
may, or may not, have constituted a “fair use,” id., at 425–&#xD;
426). Sony knew many customers would use its VCRs to&#xD;
engage in unauthorized copying and “ ‘library-building.’ ”&#xD;
Id., at 458–459 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). But that fact,&#xD;
said the Court, was insufficient to make Sony itself an&#xD;
infringer. And the Court ultimately held that Sony was&#xD;
not liable for its customers’ acts of infringement.&#xD;
   In reaching this conclusion, the Court recognized the&#xD;
need for the law, in fixing secondary copyright liability, to&#xD;
“strike a balance between a copyright holder’s legitimate&#xD;
demand for effective—not merely symbolic—protection of&#xD;
the statutory monopoly, and the rights of others freely to&#xD;
engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce.” Id.,&#xD;
at 442. It pointed to patent law’s “staple article of com-&#xD;
merce” doctrine, ibid., under which a distributor of a&#xD;
product is not liable for patent infringement by its cus-&#xD;
tomers unless that product is “unsuited for any commer-&#xD;
cial noninfringing use.” Dawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm &amp;&#xD;
Haas Co., 448 U. S. 176, 198 (1980). The Court wrote that&#xD;
the sale of copying equipment, “like the sale of other arti-&#xD;
cles of commerce, does not constitute contributory in-&#xD;
fringement if the product is widely used for legitimate,&#xD;
unobjectionable purposes. Indeed, it need merely be capa-&#xD;

ble of substantial noninfringing uses.” Sony, 464 U. S., at&#xD;
442 (emphasis added). The Court ultimately characterized&#xD;
the legal “question” in the particular case as “whether&#xD;
[Sony’s VCR] is capable of commercially significant nonin-&#xD;
fringing uses” (while declining to give “precise content” to&#xD;
these terms). Ibid. (emphasis added).&#xD;
   It then applied this standard. The Court had before it a&#xD;
survey (commissioned by the District Court and then&#xD;
prepared by the respondents) showing that roughly 9% of&#xD;
all VCR recordings were of the type—namely, religious,&#xD;
educational, and sports programming—owned by produc-&#xD;
ers and distributors testifying on Sony’s behalf who did&#xD;
not object to time-shifting. See Brief for Respondent&#xD;
Universal Studios et al. O. T. 1983, No. 81–1687, pp. 52–&#xD;
53; see also Sony, supra, at 424 (7.3% of all Sony VCR use&#xD;
is to record sports programs; representatives of the sports&#xD;
leagues do not object). A much higher percentage of VCR&#xD;
users had at one point taped an authorized program, in&#xD;
addition to taping unauthorized programs. And the plain-&#xD;
tiffs—not a large class of content providers as in this&#xD;
case—owned only a small percentage of the total available&#xD;
unauthorized programming. See ante, at 6–7, and n. 3&#xD;
(GINSBURG, J., concurring). But of all the taping actually&#xD;
done by Sony’s customers, only around 9% was of the sort&#xD;
the Court referred to as authorized.&#xD;
   The Court found that the magnitude of authorized&#xD;
programming was “significant,” and it also noted the&#xD;
“significant potential for future authorized copying.” 464&#xD;
U. S., at 444. The Court supported this conclusion by&#xD;
referencing the trial testimony of professional sports&#xD;
league officials and a religious broadcasting representa-&#xD;
tive. Id., at 444, and n. 24. It also discussed (1) a Los&#xD;
Angeles educational station affiliated with the Public&#xD;
Broadcasting Service that made many of its programs&#xD;
available for home taping, and (2) Mr. Rogers’ Neighbor-&#xD;
hood, a widely watched children’s program. Id., at 445.&#xD;

                  BREYER, J., concurring&#xD;
&#xD;
On the basis of this testimony and other similar evidence,&#xD;
the Court determined that producers of this kind had&#xD;
authorized duplication of their copyrighted programs “in&#xD;
significant enough numbers to create a substantial market&#xD;
for a noninfringing use of the” VCR. Id., at 447, n. 28&#xD;
(emphasis added).&#xD;
   The Court, in using the key word “substantial,” indi-&#xD;
cated that these circumstances alone constituted a suffi-&#xD;
cient basis for rejecting the imposition of secondary liabil-&#xD;
ity. See id., at 456 (“Sony demonstrated a significant&#xD;
likelihood that substantial numbers of copyright holders”&#xD;
would not object to time-shifting (emphasis added)).&#xD;
Nonetheless, the Court buttressed its conclusion by find-&#xD;
ing separately that, in any event, unauthorized time-&#xD;
shifting often constituted not infringement, but “fair use.”&#xD;
Id., at 447–456.&#xD;
                              B&#xD;
   When measured against Sony’s underlying evidence and&#xD;
analysis, the evidence now before us shows that Grokster&#xD;
passes Sony’s test—that is, whether the company’s prod-&#xD;
uct is capable of substantial or commercially significant&#xD;
noninfringing uses. Id., at 442. For one thing, petitioners’&#xD;
(hereinafter MGM) own expert declared that 75% of cur-&#xD;
rent files available on Grokster are infringing and 15% are&#xD;
“likely infringing.” See App. 436–439, ¶¶6–17 (Decl. of Dr.&#xD;
Ingram Olkin); cf. ante, at 4 (opinion of the Court). That&#xD;
leaves some number of files near 10% that apparently are&#xD;
noninfringing, a figure very similar to the 9% or so of&#xD;
authorized time-shifting uses of the VCR that the Court&#xD;
faced in Sony.&#xD;
   As in Sony, witnesses here explained the nature of the&#xD;
noninfringing files on Grokster’s network without detailed&#xD;
quantification. Those files include:&#xD;
&#xD;
—Authorized copies of music by artists such as Wilco,&#xD;

&#xD;
Janis Ian, Pearl Jam, Dave Matthews, John Mayer, and&#xD;
others. See App. at 152–153, ¶¶9–13 (Decl. of Aram&#xD;
Sinnreich) (Wilco’s “lesson has already been adopted by&#xD;
artists still signed to their major labels”); id., at 170, ¶¶5–&#xD;
7 (Decl. of Patricia D. Hoekman) (locating “numerous&#xD;
audio recordings” that were authorized for swapping); id.,&#xD;
at 74, ¶10 (Decl. of Daniel B. Rung) (describing Grokster’s&#xD;
partnership with a company that hosts music from thou-&#xD;
sands of independent artists)&#xD;
&#xD;
—Free electronic books and other works from various&#xD;
online publishers, including Project Gutenberg. See id., at&#xD;
136, ¶12 (Decl. of Gregory B. Newby) (“Numerous author-&#xD;
ized and public domain Project Gutenberg eBooks are&#xD;
made available” on Grokster. Project Gutenberg “wel-&#xD;
comes this widespread sharing . . . using these software&#xD;
products[,] since they assist us in meeting our objectives”);&#xD;
id., at 159–160, ¶32 (Decl. of Sinnreich)&#xD;
&#xD;
—Public domain and authorized software, such as WinZip&#xD;
8.1. Id., at 170, ¶8 (Decl. of Hoekman); id., at 165, ¶¶4–7&#xD;
(Decl. of John Busher)&#xD;
&#xD;
—Licensed music videos and television and movie seg-&#xD;
ments distributed via digital video packaging with the&#xD;
permission of the copyright holder. Id., at 70, ¶24 (Decl. of&#xD;
Sean L. Mayers)&#xD;
&#xD;
  The nature of these and other lawfully swapped files is&#xD;
such that it is reasonable to infer quantities of current&#xD;
lawful use roughly approximate to those at issue in Sony.&#xD;
At least, MGM has offered no evidence sufficient to sur-&#xD;
vive summary judgment that could plausibly demonstrate&#xD;
a significant quantitative difference. See ante, at 4 (opin-&#xD;
ion of the Court); see also Brief for Motion Picture Studio&#xD;
and Recording Company Petitioners i (referring to “at&#xD;
6         METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER STUDIOS INC. v.&#xD;
                    GROKSTER, LTD.&#xD;
                  BREYER, J., concurring&#xD;
&#xD;
least 90% of the total use of the services”); but see ante, at&#xD;
6–7, n. 3 (GINSBURG, J., concurring). To be sure, in quan-&#xD;
titative terms these uses account for only a small percent-&#xD;
age of the total number of uses of Grokster’s product. But&#xD;
the same was true in Sony, which characterized the rela-&#xD;
tively limited authorized copying market as “substantial.”&#xD;
(The Court made clear as well in Sony that the amount of&#xD;
material then presently available for lawful copying—if&#xD;
not actually copied—was significant, see 464 U. S., at 444,&#xD;
and the same is certainly true in this case.)&#xD;
   Importantly, Sony also used the word “capable,” asking&#xD;
whether the product is “capable of” substantial noninfring-&#xD;
ing uses. Its language and analysis suggest that a figure&#xD;
like 10%, if fixed for all time, might well prove insufficient,&#xD;
but that such a figure serves as an adequate foundation&#xD;
where there is a reasonable prospect of expanded legiti-&#xD;
mate uses over time. See ibid. (noting a “significant po-&#xD;
tential for future authorized copying”). And its language&#xD;
also indicates the appropriateness of looking to potential&#xD;
future uses of the product to determine its “capability.”&#xD;
   Here the record reveals a significant future market for&#xD;
noninfringing uses of Grokster-type peer-to-peer software.&#xD;
Such software permits the exchange of any sort of digital&#xD;
file—whether that file does, or does not, contain copy-&#xD;
righted material. As more and more uncopyrighted infor-&#xD;
mation is stored in swappable form, it seems a likely&#xD;
inference that lawful peer-to-peer sharing will become&#xD;
increasingly prevalent. See, e.g., App. 142, ¶20 (Decl. of&#xD;
Brewster Kahle) (“The [Internet Archive] welcomes [the]&#xD;
redistribution [of authorized films] by the Morpheus-&#xD;
Grokster-KaZaa community of users”); id., at 166, ¶8&#xD;
(Decl. of Busher) (sales figures of $1,000 to $10,000 per&#xD;
month through peer-to-peer networks “will increase in the&#xD;
future as Acoustica’s trialware is more widely distributed&#xD;
through these networks”); id., at 156–164, ¶¶21–40 (Decl.&#xD;
of Sinnreich).&#xD;
                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            7&#xD;
&#xD;
                    BREYER, J., concurring&#xD;
&#xD;
   And that is just what is happening. Such legitimate&#xD;
noninfringing uses are coming to include the swapping of:&#xD;
research information (the initial purpose of many peer-to-&#xD;
peer networks); public domain films (e.g., those owned by&#xD;
the Prelinger Archive); historical recordings and digital&#xD;
educational materials (e.g., those stored on the Internet&#xD;
Archive); digital photos (OurPictures, for example, is&#xD;
starting a P2P photo-swapping service); “shareware” and&#xD;
“freeware” (e.g., Linux and certain Windows software);&#xD;
secure licensed music and movie files (Intent MediaWorks,&#xD;
for example, protects licensed content sent across P2P&#xD;
networks); news broadcasts past and present (the BBC&#xD;
Creative Archive lets users “rip, mix and share the BBC”);&#xD;
user-created audio and video files (including “podcasts”&#xD;
that may be distributed through P2P software); and all&#xD;
manner of free “open content” works collected by Creative&#xD;
Commons (one can search for Creative Commons material&#xD;
on StreamCast). See Brief for Distributed Computing&#xD;
Industry Association as Amicus Curiae 15–26; Merges, A&#xD;
New Dynamism in the Public Domain, 71 U. Chi. L. Rev.&#xD;
183 (2004). I can find nothing in the record that suggests&#xD;
that this course of events will not continue to flow natu-&#xD;
rally as a consequence of the character of the software&#xD;
taken together with the foreseeable development of the&#xD;
Internet and of information technology. Cf. ante, at 1–2&#xD;
(opinion of the Court) (discussing the significant benefits&#xD;
of peer-to-peer technology).&#xD;
   There may be other now-unforeseen noninfringing uses&#xD;
that develop for peer-to-peer software, just as the home-&#xD;
video rental industry (unmentioned in Sony) developed for&#xD;
the VCR. But the foreseeable development of such uses,&#xD;
when taken together with an estimated 10% noninfringing&#xD;
material, is sufficient to meet Sony’s standard. And while&#xD;
Sony considered the record following a trial, there are no&#xD;
facts asserted by MGM in its summary judgment filings&#xD;
that lead me to believe the outcome after a trial here could&#xD;

                  BREYER, J., concurring&#xD;
&#xD;
be any different. The lower courts reached the same&#xD;
conclusion.&#xD;
  Of course, Grokster itself may not want to develop these&#xD;
other noninfringing uses. But Sony’s standard seeks to&#xD;
protect not the Groksters of this world (which in any event&#xD;
may well be liable under today’s holding), but the devel-&#xD;
opment of technology more generally. And Grokster’s&#xD;
desires in this respect are beside the point.&#xD;
                                II&#xD;
   The real question here, I believe, is not whether the&#xD;
record evidence satisfies Sony. As I have interpreted the&#xD;
standard set forth in that case, it does. And of the Courts&#xD;
of Appeals that have considered the matter, only one has&#xD;
proposed interpreting Sony more strictly than I would&#xD;
do—in a case where the product might have failed under&#xD;
any standard. In re Aimster Copyright Litigation, 334&#xD;
F. 3d 643, 653 (CA7 2003) (defendant “failed to show that&#xD;
its service is ever used for any purpose other than to in-&#xD;
fringe” copyrights (emphasis added)); see Matthew Bender&#xD;
&amp; Co., Inc. v. West Pub. Co., 158 F. 3d 693, 706–707 (CA2&#xD;
1998) (court did not require that noninfringing uses be&#xD;
“predominant,” it merely found that they were predomi-&#xD;
nant, and therefore provided no analysis of Sony’s bounda-&#xD;
ries); but see ante, at 3 n. 1 (GINSBURG, J., concurring); see&#xD;
also A&amp;M Records v. Napster, Inc., 239 F. 3d 1004, 1020&#xD;
(CA9 2001) (discussing Sony); Cable/Home Communica-&#xD;

nacore Holdings Corp. v. U. S. Philips Corp., 363 F. 3d&#xD;
1263, 1275 (CA Fed. 2004) (same); see also Doe v. GTE&#xD;
Corp., 347 F. 3d 655, 661 (CA7 2003) (“A person may be&#xD;

it sells has no (or only slight) legal use”).&#xD;
   Instead, the real question is whether we should modify&#xD;

&#xD;
                    BREYER, J., concurring&#xD;
&#xD;
the Sony standard, as MGM requests, or interpret Sony&#xD;
more strictly, as I believe JUSTICE GINSBURG’s approach&#xD;
would do in practice. Compare ante, at 4–8 (concurring)&#xD;
(insufficient evidence in this case of both present lawful&#xD;
uses and of a reasonable prospect that substantial nonin-&#xD;
fringing uses would develop over time), with Sony, 464&#xD;
U. S., at 442–447 (basing conclusion as to the likely exis-&#xD;
tence of a substantial market for authorized copying upon&#xD;
general declarations, some survey data, and common&#xD;
sense).&#xD;
   As I have said, Sony itself sought to “strike a balance&#xD;
between a copyright holder’s legitimate demand for effec-&#xD;
tive—not merely symbolic—protection of the statutory&#xD;
monopoly, and the rights of others freely to engage in&#xD;
substantially unrelated areas of commerce.” Id., at 442.&#xD;
Thus, to determine whether modification, or a strict inter-&#xD;
pretation, of Sony is needed, I would ask whether MGM&#xD;
has shown that Sony incorrectly balanced copyright and&#xD;
new-technology interests. In particular: (1) Has Sony (as I&#xD;
interpret it) worked to protect new technology? (2) If so,&#xD;
would modification or strict interpretation significantly&#xD;
weaken that protection? (3) If so, would new or necessary&#xD;
copyright-related benefits outweigh any such weakening?&#xD;
                              A&#xD;
   The first question is the easiest to answer. Sony’s rule,&#xD;
as I interpret it, has provided entrepreneurs with needed&#xD;
assurance that they will be shielded from copyright liabil-&#xD;
ity as they bring valuable new technologies to market.&#xD;
   Sony’s rule is clear. That clarity allows those who de-&#xD;
velop new products that are capable of substantial nonin-&#xD;
fringing uses to know, ex ante, that distribution of their&#xD;
product will not yield massive monetary liability. At the&#xD;
same time, it helps deter them from distributing products&#xD;
that have no other real function than—or that are specifi-&#xD;
cally intended for—copyright infringement, deterrence&#xD;
10       METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER STUDIOS INC. v.&#xD;
                   GROKSTER, LTD.&#xD;
                 BREYER, J., concurring&#xD;
&#xD;
that the Court’s holding today reinforces (by adding a&#xD;
weapon to the copyright holder’s legal arsenal).&#xD;
   Sony’s rule is strongly technology protecting. The rule&#xD;
deliberately makes it difficult for courts to find secondary&#xD;
liability where new technology is at issue. It establishes&#xD;
that the law will not impose copyright liability upon the&#xD;
distributors of dual-use technologies (who do not them-&#xD;
selves engage in unauthorized copying) unless the product&#xD;
in question will be used almost exclusively to infringe&#xD;
copyrights (or unless they actively induce infringements as&#xD;
we today describe). Sony thereby recognizes that the&#xD;
copyright laws are not intended to discourage or to control&#xD;
the emergence of new technologies, including (perhaps&#xD;
especially) those that help disseminate information and&#xD;
ideas more broadly or more efficiently. Thus Sony’s rule&#xD;
shelters VCRs, typewriters, tape recorders, photocopiers,&#xD;
computers, cassette players, compact disc burners, digital&#xD;
video recorders, MP3 players, Internet search engines, and&#xD;
peer-to-peer software. But Sony’s rule does not shelter&#xD;
descramblers, even if one could theoretically use a de-&#xD;
scrambler in a noninfringing way. 464 U. S., at 441–442;&#xD;
Compare Cable/Home Communication Corp., supra, at&#xD;
837–850 (developer liable for advertising television signal&#xD;
descrambler), with Vault Corp., supra, at 262 (primary use&#xD;
infringing but a substantial noninfringing use).&#xD;
   Sony’s rule is forward looking. It does not confine its&#xD;
scope to a static snapshot of a product’s current uses&#xD;
(thereby threatening technologies that have undeveloped&#xD;
future markets). Rather, as the VCR example makes&#xD;
clear, a product’s market can evolve dramatically over&#xD;
time. And Sony—by referring to a capacity for substantial&#xD;
noninfringing uses—recognizes that fact. Sony’s word&#xD;
“capable” refers to a plausible, not simply a theoretical,&#xD;
likelihood that such uses will come to pass, and that fact&#xD;
anchors Sony in practical reality. Cf. Aimster, supra, at&#xD;
651.&#xD;

&#xD;
                    BREYER, J., concurring&#xD;
&#xD;
   Sony’s rule is mindful of the limitations facing judges&#xD;
where matters of technology are concerned. Judges have&#xD;
no specialized technical ability to answer questions about&#xD;
present or future technological feasibilility or commercial&#xD;
viability where technology professionals, engineers, and&#xD;
venture capitalists themselves may radically disagree and&#xD;
where answers may differ depending upon whether one&#xD;
focuses upon the time of product development or the time&#xD;
of distribution.     Consider, for example, the question&#xD;
whether devices can be added to Grokster’s software that&#xD;
will filter out infringing files. MGM tells us this is easy&#xD;
enough to do, as do several amici that produce and sell the&#xD;
filtering technology. See, e.g., Brief for Motion Picture&#xD;
Studio Petitioners 11; Brief for Audible Magic Corp. et al.&#xD;
as Amicus Curiae 3–10. Grokster says it is not at all easy&#xD;
to do, and not an efficient solution in any event, and sev-&#xD;
eral apparently disinterested computer science professors&#xD;
agree. See Brief for Respondents 31; Brief for Computer&#xD;
Science Professors as Amicus Curiae 6–10, 14–18. Which&#xD;
account should a judge credit? Sony says that the judge&#xD;
will not necessarily have to decide.&#xD;
   Given the nature of the Sony rule, it is not surprising&#xD;
that in the last 20 years, there have been relatively few&#xD;
contributory infringement suits—based on a product&#xD;
distribution theory—brought against technology providers&#xD;
(a small handful of federal appellate court cases and per-&#xD;
haps fewer than two dozen District Court cases in the last&#xD;
20 years). I have found nothing in the briefs or the record&#xD;
that shows that Sony has failed to achieve its innovation-&#xD;
protecting objective.&#xD;
                             B&#xD;
   The second, more difficult, question is whether a modi-&#xD;
fied Sony rule (or a strict interpretation) would signifi-&#xD;
cantly weaken the law’s ability to protect new technology.&#xD;
JUSTICE GINSBURG’s approach would require defendants&#xD;
12       METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER STUDIOS INC. v.&#xD;
                   GROKSTER, LTD.&#xD;
                 BREYER, J., concurring&#xD;
&#xD;
to produce considerably more concrete evidence—more&#xD;
than was presented here—to earn Sony’s shelter. That&#xD;
heavier evidentiary demand, and especially the more&#xD;
dramatic (case-by-case balancing) modifications that MGM&#xD;
and the Government seek, would, I believe, undercut the&#xD;
protection that Sony now offers.&#xD;
   To require defendants to provide, for example, detailed&#xD;
evidence—say business plans, profitability estimates,&#xD;
projected technological modifications, and so forth—would&#xD;
doubtless make life easier for copyrightholder plaintiffs.&#xD;
But it would simultaneously increase the legal uncertainty&#xD;
that surrounds the creation or development of a new&#xD;
technology capable of being put to infringing uses. Inven-&#xD;
tors and entrepreneurs (in the garage, the dorm room, the&#xD;
corporate lab, or the boardroom) would have to fear (and&#xD;
in many cases endure) costly and extensive trials when&#xD;
they create, produce, or distribute the sort of information&#xD;
technology that can be used for copyright infringement.&#xD;
They would often be left guessing as to how a court, upon&#xD;
later review of the product and its uses, would decide&#xD;
when necessarily rough estimates amounted to sufficient&#xD;
evidence. They would have no way to predict how courts&#xD;
would weigh the respective values of infringing and nonin-&#xD;
fringing uses; determine the efficiency and advisability of&#xD;
technological changes; or assess a product’s potential&#xD;
future markets. The price of a wrong guess—even if it&#xD;
involves a good-faith effort to assess technical and com-&#xD;
mercial viability—could be large statutory damages (not&#xD;
less than $750 and up to $30,000 per infringed work). 17&#xD;
U. S. C. §504(c)(1). The additional risk and uncertainty&#xD;
would mean a consequent additional chill of technological&#xD;
development.&#xD;
                         C&#xD;
 The third question—whether a positive copyright impact&#xD;
would outweigh any technology-related loss—I find the&#xD;
                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           13&#xD;
&#xD;
                     BREYER, J., concurring&#xD;
&#xD;
most difficult of the three. I do not doubt that a more&#xD;
intrusive Sony test would generally provide greater reve-&#xD;
nue security for copyright holders. But it is harder to&#xD;
conclude that the gains on the copyright swings would&#xD;
exceed the losses on the technology roundabouts.&#xD;
   For one thing, the law disfavors equating the two differ-&#xD;
ent kinds of gain and loss; rather, it leans in favor of&#xD;
protecting technology. As Sony itself makes clear, the&#xD;
producer of a technology which permits unlawful copying&#xD;
does not himself engage in unlawful copying—a fact that&#xD;
makes the attachment of copyright liability to the crea-&#xD;
tion, production, or distribution of the technology an ex-&#xD;
ceptional thing. See 464 U. S., at 431 (courts “must be&#xD;
circumspect” in construing the copyright laws to preclude&#xD;
distribution of new technologies). Moreover, Sony has&#xD;
been the law for some time. And that fact imposes a seri-&#xD;
ous burden upon copyright holders like MGM to show a&#xD;
need for change in the current rules of the game, including&#xD;
a more strict interpretation of the test. See, e.g., Brief for&#xD;
Motion Picture Studio Petitioners 31 (Sony should not&#xD;
protect products when the “primary or principal” use is&#xD;
infringing).&#xD;
   In any event, the evidence now available does not, in my&#xD;
view, make out a sufficiently strong case for change. To&#xD;
say this is not to doubt the basic need to protect copy-&#xD;
righted material from infringement. The Constitution&#xD;
itself stresses the vital role that copyright plays in advanc-&#xD;
ing the “useful Arts.” Art. I, §8, cl. 8. No one disputes&#xD;
that “reward to the author or artist serves to induce re-&#xD;
lease to the public of the products of his creative genius.”&#xD;
United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U. S. 131,&#xD;
158 (1948). And deliberate unlawful copying is no less an&#xD;
unlawful taking of property than garden-variety theft.&#xD;
See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §2319 (criminal copyright infringe-&#xD;
ment); §1961(1)(B) (copyright infringement can be a predi-&#xD;
cate act under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt&#xD;
14       METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER STUDIOS INC. v.&#xD;

                 BREYER, J., concurring&#xD;
&#xD;
Organizations Act); §1956(c)(7)(D) (money laundering&#xD;
includes the receipt of proceeds from copyright infringe-&#xD;
ment). But these highly general principles cannot by&#xD;
themselves tell us how to balance the interests at issue in&#xD;
Sony or whether Sony’s standard needs modification. And&#xD;
at certain key points, information is lacking.&#xD;
   Will an unmodified Sony lead to a significant diminution&#xD;
in the amount or quality of creative work produced? Since&#xD;
copyright’s basic objective is creation and its revenue&#xD;
objectives but a means to that end, this is the underlying&#xD;
copyright question. See Twentieth Century Music Corp. v.&#xD;
Aiken, 422 U. S. 151, 156 (1975) (“Creative work is to be&#xD;
encouraged and rewarded, but private motivation must&#xD;
ultimately serve the cause of promoting broad public&#xD;
availability of literature, music, and the other arts”). And&#xD;
its answer is far from clear.&#xD;
   Unauthorized copying likely diminishes industry&#xD;
revenue, though it is not clear by how much. Compare&#xD;

   The extent to which related production has actually and&#xD;
resultingly declined remains uncertain, though there is&#xD;
good reason to believe that the decline, if any, is not sub-&#xD;
stantial. See, e.g., M. Madden, Pew Internet &amp; American&#xD;
Life Project, Artists, Musicians, and the Internet, p. 21,&#xD;

ing is a minor threat or no threat at all to creative indus-&#xD;
tries); Benkler, Sharing Nicely: On Shareable Goods and&#xD;
the Emergence of Sharing as a Modality of Economic&#xD;
Production, 114 Yale L. J. 273, 351–352 (2004) (“Much of&#xD;
the actual flow of revenue to artists—from performances&#xD;
and other sources—is stable even assuming a complete&#xD;
displacement of the CD market by peer-to-peer distribu-&#xD;
tion . . . . [I]t would be silly to think that music, a cultural&#xD;
form without which no human society has existed, will&#xD;
cease to be in our world [because of illegal file swapping]”).&#xD;
   More importantly, copyright holders at least potentially&#xD;
have other tools available to reduce piracy and to abate&#xD;
whatever threat it poses to creative production. As today’s&#xD;
opinion makes clear, a copyright holder may proceed&#xD;
against a technology provider where a provable specific&#xD;
intent to infringe (of the kind the Court describes) is pre-&#xD;
sent. Ante, at 24 (opinion of the Court). Services like&#xD;
Grokster may well be liable under an inducement theory.&#xD;
   In addition, a copyright holder has always had the legal&#xD;
authority to bring a traditional infringement suit against&#xD;
one who wrongfully copies. Indeed, since September 2003,&#xD;
the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has&#xD;
filed “thousands of suits against people for sharing copy-&#xD;
righted material.” Walker, New Movement Hits Universi-&#xD;
ties: Get Legal Music, Washington Post, Mar. 17, 2005,&#xD;
p. E1. These suits have provided copyright holders with&#xD;
damages; have served as a teaching tool, making clear&#xD;

  Further, copyright holders may develop new technologi-&#xD;
cal devices that will help curb unlawful infringement.&#xD;
Some new technology, called “digital ‘watermarking’ ” and&#xD;
“digital fingerprint[ing],” can encode within the file infor-&#xD;
mation about the author and the copyright scope and date,&#xD;
which “fingerprints” can help to expose infringers. RIAA&#xD;

Amicus Curiae 5–8 (arguing that peer-to-peer service&#xD;
providers can more easily block unlawful swapping).&#xD;
   At the same time, advances in technology have discour-&#xD;
aged unlawful copying by making lawful copying (e.g.,&#xD;
downloading music with the copyright holder’s permission)&#xD;
cheaper and easier to achieve. Several services now sell&#xD;
music for less than $1 per song. (Walmart.com, for exam-&#xD;
ple, charges $0.88 each). Consequently, many consumers&#xD;
initially attracted to the convenience and flexibility of&#xD;
services like Grokster are now migrating to lawful paid&#xD;
services (services with copying permission) where they can&#xD;
enjoy at little cost even greater convenience and flexibility&#xD;
without engaging in unlawful swapping. See Wu, When&#xD;
Code Isn’t Law, 89 Va. L. Rev. 679, 731–735 (2003) (noting&#xD;

part on the lessons of Grokster.&#xD;
   Finally, as Sony recognized, the legislative option re-&#xD;
mains available. Courts are less well suited than Con-&#xD;

permutations of competing interests that are inevitably&#xD;
implicated by such new technology.” Sony, 464 U. S., at&#xD;

   I do not know whether these developments and similar&#xD;
alternatives will prove sufficient, but I am reasonably&#xD;
certain that, given their existence, a strong demonstrated&#xD;
need for modifying Sony (or for interpreting Sony’s stan-&#xD;
dard more strictly) has not yet been shown. That fact,&#xD;
along with the added risks that modification (or strict&#xD;
interpretation) would impose upon technological innova-&#xD;
tion, leads me to the conclusion that we should maintain&#xD;
Sony, reading its standard as I have read it. As so read, it&#xD;
requires affirmance of the Ninth Circuit’s determination of&#xD;
the relevant aspects of the Sony question.&#xD;
