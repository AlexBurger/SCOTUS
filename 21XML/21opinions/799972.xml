&#xD;
    CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA,&#xD;
                FIRST APPELLATE DISTRICT&#xD;
&#xD;
      No. 04–6964. Argued April 18, 2005—Decided June 13, 2005&#xD;
Petitioner Johnson, a black man, was convicted in a California state&#xD;
  court of assaulting and murdering a white child. During jury selec-&#xD;
  tion, a number of prospective jurors were removed for cause until 43&#xD;
  eligible jurors remained, three of whom were black. The prosecutor&#xD;
  used 3 of his 12 peremptory challenges to remove the prospective&#xD;
  black jurors, resulting in an all-white jury. Defense counsel objected&#xD;
  to those strikes on the ground that they were unconstitutionally&#xD;
  based on race. The trial judge did not ask the prosecutor to explain&#xD;
  his strikes, but instead simply found that petitioner had failed to es-&#xD;
  tablish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination under the gov-&#xD;
  erning state precedent, People v. Wheeler, which required a showing&#xD;
  of a strong likelihood that the exercise of peremptory challenges was&#xD;
  based on group bias. The judge explained that, although the case&#xD;
  was close, his review of the record convinced him that the prosecu-&#xD;
  tor’s strikes could be justified by race-neutral reasons. The Califor-&#xD;
  nia Court of Appeal set aside the conviction, but the State Supreme&#xD;
  Court reinstated it, stressing that Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79,&#xD;
  permits state courts to establish the standards used to evaluate the&#xD;
  sufficiency of prima facie cases of purposeful discrimination in jury&#xD;
  selection. Reviewing Batson, Wheeler, and their progeny, the court&#xD;
  concluded that Wheeler’s “strong likelihood” standard is entirely con-&#xD;
  sistent with Batson. Under Batson, the court held, a state court may&#xD;
  require the objector to present not merely enough evidence to permit&#xD;
  an inference that discrimination has occurred, but sufficiently strong&#xD;
  evidence to establish that the challenges, if not explained, were more&#xD;
  likely than not based on race. Applying that standard, the court ac-&#xD;
  knowledged that the exclusion of all three black prospective jurors&#xD;
  looked suspicious, but deferred to the trial judge’s ruling.&#xD;
2                     JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIA&#xD;
&#xD;
                                 Syllabus&#xD;
&#xD;
Held: California’s “more likely than not” standard is an inappropriate&#xD;
 yardstick by which to measure the sufficiency of a prima facie case of&#xD;
 purposeful discrimination in jury selection. This narrow but impor-&#xD;
 tant issue concerns the scope of the first of three steps Batson enu-&#xD;
 merated: (1) Once the defendant has made out a prima facie case and&#xD;
 (2) the State has satisfied its burden to offer permissible race-neutral&#xD;
 justifications for the strikes, e.g., 476 U. S., at 94, then (3) the trial&#xD;
 court must decide whether the defendant has proved purposeful ra-&#xD;
 cial discrimination, Purkett v. Elem, 514 U. S. 765. Batson does not&#xD;
 permit California to require at step one that the objector show that it&#xD;
 is more likely than not the other party’s peremptory challenges, if&#xD;
 unexplained, were based on impermissible group bias. The Batson&#xD;
 Court held that a prima facie case can be made out by offering a wide&#xD;
 variety of evidence, so long as the sum of the proffered facts gives&#xD;
 “rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.” 476 U. S., at 94.&#xD;
 The Court explained that to establish a prima facie case, the defen-&#xD;
 dant must show that his membership in a cognizable racial group,&#xD;
 the prosecutor’s exercise of peremptory challenges to remove mem-&#xD;
 bers of that group, the indisputable fact that such challenges permit&#xD;
 those inclined to discriminate to do so, and any other relevant cir-&#xD;
 cumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor excluded venire&#xD;
 members on account of race. Id., at 96. The Court assumed that the&#xD;
 trial judge would have the benefit of all relevant circumstances, in-&#xD;
 cluding the prosecutor’s explanation, before deciding whether it was&#xD;
 more likely than not that the peremptory challenge was improperly&#xD;
 motivated. The Court did not intend the first step to be so onerous&#xD;
 that a defendant would have to persuade the judge—on the basis of&#xD;
 all the facts, some of which are impossible for the defendant to know&#xD;
 with certainty—that the challenge was more likely than not the&#xD;
 product of purposeful discrimination. Instead, a defendant satisfies&#xD;
 Batson’s first step requirements by producing evidence sufficient to&#xD;
 permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination has&#xD;
 occurred. The facts of this case illustrate that California’s standard&#xD;
 is at odds with the prima facie inquiry mandated by Batson. The&#xD;
 permissible inferences of discrimination, which caused the trial judge&#xD;
 to comment that the case was close and the California Supreme&#xD;
 Court to acknowledge that it was suspicious that all three black pro-&#xD;
 spective jurors were removed, were sufficient to establish a prima fa-&#xD;
 cie case. Pp. 10–11.&#xD;

         JAY SHAWN JOHNSON, PETITIONER v.&#xD;
                   CALIFORNIA&#xD;
   ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF&#xD;
        CALIFORNIA, FIRST APPELLATE DISTRICT&#xD;
                                 [June 13, 2005]&#xD;
&#xD;
   JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.&#xD;
   The Supreme Court of California and the United States&#xD;
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit have provided&#xD;
conflicting answers to the following question: “Whether to&#xD;
establish a prima facie case under Batson v. Kentucky, 476&#xD;
U. S. 79 (1986), the objector must show that it is more likely&#xD;
than not that the other party’s peremptory challenges, if&#xD;
unexplained, were based on impermissible group bias?” Pet.&#xD;
for Cert. i. Because both of those courts regularly review&#xD;
the validity of convictions obtained in California criminal&#xD;
trials, respondent, the State of California, agreed to peti-&#xD;
tioner’s request that we grant certiorari and resolve the&#xD;
conflict. We agree with the Ninth Circuit that the question&#xD;
presented must be answered in the negative, and accord-&#xD;
ingly reverse the judgment of the California Supreme Court.&#xD;
                              I&#xD;
  Petitioner Jay Shawn Johnson, a black male, was con-&#xD;
victed in a California trial court of second-degree murder&#xD;
and assault on a white 19-month-old child, resulting in&#xD;
death. During jury selection, a number of prospective&#xD;
jurors were removed for cause until 43 eligible jurors&#xD;
2                   JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIA&#xD;
&#xD;
                        Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
remained, 3 of whom were black. The prosecutor used 3 of&#xD;
his 12 peremptory challenges to remove the black prospec-&#xD;
tive jurors. The resulting jury, including alternates, was&#xD;
all white.&#xD;
   After the prosecutor exercised the second of his three&#xD;
peremptory challenges against the prospective black&#xD;
jurors, defense counsel objected on the ground that the&#xD;
challenge was unconstitutionally based on race under both&#xD;
the California and United States Constitutions. People v.&#xD;
Johnson, 30 Cal. 4th 1302, 1307, 71 P. 3d 270, 272–273&#xD;
(2003).1 Defense counsel alleged that the prosecutor “had&#xD;
no apparent reason to challenge this prospective juror&#xD;
‘other than [her] racial identity.’ ” Ibid. (alteration in&#xD;
original). The trial judge did not ask the prosecutor to&#xD;
explain the rationale for his strikes. Instead, the judge&#xD;
simply found that petitioner had failed to establish a&#xD;
prima facie case under the governing state precedent,&#xD;
People v. Wheeler, 22 Cal. 3d 258, 583 P. 2d 748 (1978),&#xD;
reasoning “ ‘that there’s not been shown a strong likelihood&#xD;
that the exercise of the peremptory challenges were based&#xD;
upon a group rather than an individual basis,’ ” 30 Cal.&#xD;
4th, at 1307, 71 P. 3d, at 272 (emphasis added). The judge&#xD;
did, however, warn the prosecutor that “ ‘we are very&#xD;
close.’ ” People v. Johnson, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 727, 729&#xD;
(2001).&#xD;
   Defense counsel made an additional motion the next day&#xD;
when the prosecutor struck the final remaining prospec-&#xD;
tive black juror. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1307, 71 P. 3d, at 272.&#xD;
Counsel argued that the prosecutor’s decision to challenge&#xD;
all of the prospective black jurors constituted a “system-&#xD;
atic attempt to exclude African-Americans from the jury&#xD;
panel.” 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 729. The trial judge still did&#xD;
not seek an explanation from the prosecutor. Instead, he&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  1 Petitioner’s state objection was made under People v. Wheeler, 22&#xD;
&#xD;
Cal. 3d 258, 583 P. 2d 748 (1978).&#xD;
                      Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                      3&#xD;
&#xD;
                           Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
explained that his own examination of the record had&#xD;
convinced him that the prosecutor’s strikes could be justi-&#xD;
fied by race-neutral reasons. Specifically, the judge opined&#xD;
that the black venire members had offered equivocal or&#xD;
confused answers in their written questionnaires. 30 Cal.&#xD;
4th, at 1307–1308, 71 P. 3d, at 272–273. Despite the fact&#xD;
that “ ‘the Court would not grant the challenges for cause,&#xD;
there were answers . . . at least on the questionnaires&#xD;
themselves [such] that the Court felt that there was suffi-&#xD;
cient basis’ ” for the strikes. Id., at 1308, 71 P. 3d, at 273&#xD;
(brackets added). Therefore, even considering that all of&#xD;
the prospective black jurors had been stricken from the&#xD;
pool, the judge determined that petitioner had failed to&#xD;
establish a prima facie case.&#xD;
   The California Court of Appeal set aside the conviction.&#xD;
People v. Johnson, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 727 (2001). Over the&#xD;
dissent of one judge, the majority ruled that the trial judge&#xD;
had erred by requiring petitioner to establish a “strong&#xD;
likelihood” that the peremptory strikes had been imper-&#xD;
missibly based on race. Instead, the trial judge should&#xD;
have only required petitioner to proffer enough evidence to&#xD;
support an “inference” of discrimination.2 The Court of&#xD;
Appeal’s holding relied on decisions of this Court, prior&#xD;
California case law, and the decision of the United States&#xD;
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Wade v. Terhune,&#xD;
202 F. 3d 1190 (2000). Applying the proper “reasonable&#xD;
inference” standard, the majority concluded that peti-&#xD;
tioner had produced sufficient evidence to support a prima&#xD;
facie case.&#xD;
   Respondent appealed, and the California Supreme&#xD;
Court reinstated petitioner’s conviction over the dissent of&#xD;
——————&#xD;
   2 In reaching this holding, the Court of Appeal rejected the notion&#xD;
&#xD;
that a showing of a “ ‘strong likelihood’ ” is equivalent to a “ ‘reasonable&#xD;
inference.’ ” To conclude so would “be as novel a proposition as the idea&#xD;
that ‘clear and convincing evidence’ has always meant a ‘preponderance&#xD;
of the evidence.’ ” 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 733.&#xD;
4                         JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIA&#xD;
&#xD;
                             Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
two justices. The court stressed that Batson v. Kentucky,&#xD;
476 U. S. 79 (1986), left to state courts the task of estab-&#xD;
lishing the standards used to evaluate the sufficiency of&#xD;
defendants’ prima facie cases. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1314, 71&#xD;
P. 3d, at 277. The court then reviewed Batson, Wheeler,&#xD;
and those decisions’ progeny, and concluded that&#xD;
“Wheeler’s terms ‘strong likelihood’ and ‘reasonable infer-&#xD;
ence’ state the same standard”—one that is entirely con-&#xD;
sistent with Batson. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1313, 71 P. 3d, at 277.&#xD;
A prima facie case under Batson establishes a “ ‘legally&#xD;
mandatory, rebuttable presumption,’ ” it does not merely&#xD;
constitute “enough evidence to permit the inference” that&#xD;
discrimination has occurred. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1315, 71&#xD;
P. 3d, at 278. Batson, the court held, “permits a court to&#xD;
require the objector to present, not merely ‘some evidence’&#xD;
permitting the inference, but ‘strong evidence’ that makes&#xD;
discriminatory intent more likely than not if the challenges&#xD;
are not explained.” 30 Cal. 4th, at 1316, 71 P. 3d, at 278.&#xD;
The court opined that while this burden is “not onerous,” it&#xD;
remains “substantial.” Ibid., 71 P. 3d, at 279.&#xD;
   Applying that standard, the court acknowledged that&#xD;
the case involved the “highly relevant” circumstance that&#xD;
a black defendant was “charged with killing ‘his White&#xD;
girlfriend’s child,’ ” and that “it certainly looks suspicious&#xD;
that all three African-American prospective jurors were&#xD;
removed from the jury.” Id., at 1326, 71 P. 3d, at 286. Yet&#xD;
petitioner’s Batson showing, the court held, consisted&#xD;
“primarily of the statistical disparity of peremptory chal-&#xD;
lenges between African-Americans and others.” 30 Cal.&#xD;
4th, at 1327, 71 P. 3d, at 287. Although those statistics&#xD;
were indeed “troubling and, as the trial court stated, the&#xD;
question was close,” id., at 1328, 71 P. 3d, at 287, the court&#xD;
decided to defer to the trial judge’s “carefully considered&#xD;
ruling.” Ibid.3 We granted certiorari, but dismissed the&#xD;
——————&#xD;
    3 In   dissent, Justice Kennard argued that “[r]equiring a defendant to&#xD;

&#xD;
                          Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
case for want of jurisdiction because the judgment was not&#xD;
yet final. Johnson v. California, 541 U. S. 428 (2004) (per&#xD;
curiam). After the California Court of Appeal decided the&#xD;
remaining issues, we again granted certiorari. 543 U. S.&#xD;
___ (2005).&#xD;
                              II&#xD;
   The issue in this case is narrow but important. It con-&#xD;
cerns the scope of the first of three steps this Court enu-&#xD;
merated in Batson, which together guide trial courts’&#xD;
constitutional review of peremptory strikes. Those three&#xD;
Batson steps should by now be familiar. First, the defen-&#xD;
dant must make out a prima facie case “by showing that&#xD;
the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference&#xD;
of discriminatory purpose.” 476 U. S., at 93–94 (citing&#xD;
Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 239–242 (1976)).4&#xD;
Second, once the defendant has made out a prima facie&#xD;
case, the “burden shifts to the State to explain adequately&#xD;
the racial exclusion” by offering permissible race-neutral&#xD;
justifications for the strikes. 476 U. S., at 94; see also&#xD;
Alexander v. Louisiana, 405 U. S. 625, 632 (1972). Third,&#xD;
“[i]f a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court&#xD;
must then decide . . . whether the opponent of the strike&#xD;
has proved purposeful racial discrimination.” Purkett v.&#xD;
&#xD;
——————&#xD;
persuade the trial court of the prosecutor’s discriminatory purpose at&#xD;
the first Wheeler-Batson stage short-circuits the process, and provides&#xD;
inadequate protection for the defendant’s right to a fair trial . . . .” 30&#xD;
Cal. 4th, at 1333, 71 P. 3d, at 291. The proper standard for measuring&#xD;
a prima facie case under Batson is whether the defendant has identified&#xD;
actions by the prosecutor that, “if unexplained, permit a reasonable&#xD;
inference of an improper purpose or motive.” 30 Cal. 4th, at 1339, 71&#xD;
P. 3d, at 294. Trial judges, Justice Kennard argued, should not specu-&#xD;
late when it is not “apparent that the [neutral] explanation was the&#xD;
true reason for the challenge.” Id., at 1340, 71 P. 3d, at 295.&#xD;
  4 An “inference” is generally understood to be a “conclusion reached&#xD;
&#xD;
by considering other facts and deducing a logical consequence from&#xD;
them.” Black’s Law Dictionary 781 (7th ed. 1999).&#xD;
6                     JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIA&#xD;
&#xD;
                          Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
Elem, 514 U. S. 765, 767 (1995) (per curiam).&#xD;
  The question before us is whether Batson permits Cali-&#xD;
fornia to require at step one that “the objector must show&#xD;
that it is more likely than not the other party’s peremp-&#xD;
tory challenges, if unexplained, were based on impermis-&#xD;
sible group bias.” 30 Cal. 4th, at 1318, 71 P. 3d, at 280.&#xD;
Although we recognize that States do have flexibility in&#xD;
formulating appropriate procedures to comply with Bat-&#xD;
son, we conclude that California’s “more likely than not”&#xD;
standard is an inappropriate yardstick by which to meas-&#xD;
ure the sufficiency of a prima facie case.&#xD;
  We begin with Batson itself, which on its own terms&#xD;
provides no support for California’s rule. There, we held&#xD;
that a prima facie case of discrimination can be made out&#xD;
by offering a wide variety of evidence,5 so long as the sum&#xD;
of the proffered facts gives “rise to an inference of dis-&#xD;
criminatory purpose.” 476 U. S., at 94. We explained that&#xD;
     “a defendant may establish a prima facie case of pur-&#xD;
     poseful discrimination in selection of the petit jury&#xD;
     solely on evidence concerning the prosecutor’s exercise&#xD;
     of peremptory challenges at the defendant’s trial. To&#xD;
     establish such a case, the defendant first must show&#xD;
     that he is a member of a cognizable racial group, and&#xD;
     that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory chal-&#xD;
     lenges to remove from the venire members of the de-&#xD;
     fendant’s race. Second, the defendant is entitled to&#xD;
     rely on the fact, as to which there can be no dispute,&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  5 In Batson, we spoke of the methods by which prima facie cases could&#xD;
&#xD;
be proved in permissive terms. A defendant may satisfy his prima facie&#xD;
burden, we said, “by relying solely on the facts concerning [the selection&#xD;
of the venire] in his case.” 476 U. S., at 95 (emphasis in original). We&#xD;
declined to require proof of a pattern or practice because “ ‘[a] single&#xD;
invidiously discriminatory governmental act’ is not ‘immunized by the&#xD;
absence of such discrimination in the making of other comparable&#xD;
decisions.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing&#xD;
Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 266, n. 14 (1977)).&#xD;

    that peremptory challenges constitute a jury selection&#xD;
    practice that permits ‘those to discriminate who are of&#xD;
    a mind to discriminate.’ Finally, the defendant must&#xD;
    show that these facts and any other relevant circum-&#xD;
    stances raise an inference that the prosecutor used&#xD;
    that practice to exclude the veniremen from the petit&#xD;
    jury on account of their race.” Id., at 96 (citations&#xD;
    omitted) (quoting Avery v. Georgia, 345 U. S. 559, 562&#xD;
    (1953)).&#xD;
   Indeed, Batson held that because the petitioner had&#xD;
timely objected to the prosecutor’s decision to strike “all&#xD;
black persons on the venire,” the trial court was in error&#xD;
when it “flatly rejected the objection without requiring the&#xD;
prosecutor to give an explanation for his action.” 476&#xD;
U. S., at 100. We did not hold that the petitioner had&#xD;
proved discrimination. Rather, we remanded the case for&#xD;
further proceedings because the trial court failed to de-&#xD;
mand an explanation from the prosecutor—i.e., to proceed&#xD;
to Batson’s second step—despite the fact that the peti-&#xD;
tioner’s evidence supported an inference of discrimination.&#xD;
Ibid.&#xD;
   Thus, in describing the burden-shifting framework, we&#xD;
assumed in Batson that the trial judge would have the&#xD;
benefit of all relevant circumstances, including the prose-&#xD;
cutor’s explanation, before deciding whether it was more&#xD;
likely than not that the challenge was improperly moti-&#xD;
vated. We did not intend the first step to be so onerous&#xD;
that a defendant would have to persuade the judge—on&#xD;
the basis of all the facts, some of which are impossible for&#xD;
the defendant to know with certainty—that the challenge&#xD;
was more likely than not the product of purposeful dis-&#xD;
crimination. Instead, a defendant satisfies the require-&#xD;
ments of Batson’s first step by producing evidence suffi-&#xD;
cient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that&#xD;
discrimination has occurred.&#xD;

&#xD;
                          Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
   Respondent, however, focuses on Batson’s ultimate&#xD;
sentence: “If the trial court decides that the facts estab-&#xD;
lish, prima facie, purposeful discrimination and the prose-&#xD;
cutor does not come forward with a neutral explanation for&#xD;
his action, our precedents require that petitioner’s convic-&#xD;
tion be reversed.” Ibid. For this to be true, respondent&#xD;
contends, a Batson claim must prove the ultimate facts by&#xD;
a preponderance of the evidence in the prima facie case;&#xD;
otherwise, the argument goes, a prosecutor’s failure to&#xD;
respond to a prima facie case would inexplicably entitle a&#xD;
defendant to judgment as a matter of law on the basis of&#xD;
nothing more than an inference that discrimination may&#xD;
have occurred. Brief for Respondent 13–18.&#xD;
   Respondent’s argument is misguided. Batson, of course,&#xD;
explicitly stated that the defendant ultimately carries the&#xD;
“burden of persuasion” to “ ‘prove the existence of purpose-&#xD;
ful discrimination.’ ” 476 U. S., at 93 (quoting Whitus v.&#xD;
Georgia, 385 U. S. 545, 550 (1967)). This burden of per-&#xD;
suasion “rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of&#xD;
the strike.” Purkett, 514 U. S., at 768. Thus, even if the&#xD;
State produces only a frivolous or utterly nonsensical&#xD;
justification for its strike, the case does not end—it merely&#xD;
proceeds to step three. Ibid.6 The first two Batson steps&#xD;
govern the production of evidence that allows the trial&#xD;
court to determine the persuasiveness of the defendant’s&#xD;
constitutional claim. “It is not until the third step that the&#xD;
persuasiveness of the justification becomes relevant—the&#xD;
&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  6 In the unlikely hypothetical in which the prosecutor declines to&#xD;
&#xD;
respond to a trial judge’s inquiry regarding his justification for making&#xD;
a strike, the evidence before the judge would consist not only of the&#xD;
original facts from which the prima facie case was established, but also&#xD;
the prosecutor’s refusal to justify his strike in light of the court’s&#xD;
request. Such a refusal would provide additional support for the&#xD;
inference of discrimination raised by a defendant’s prima facie case. Cf.&#xD;
United States ex rel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration, 273&#xD;
U. S. 103, 111 (1927).&#xD;

&#xD;
step in which the trial court determines whether the&#xD;
opponent of the strike has carried his burden of proving&#xD;
purposeful discrimination.” Purkett, supra, at 768.7&#xD;
   Batson’s purposes further support our conclusion. The&#xD;
constitutional interests Batson sought to vindicate are not&#xD;
limited to the rights possessed by the defendant on trial,&#xD;
see 476 U. S., at 87, nor to those citizens who desire to&#xD;
participate “in the administration of the law, as jurors,”&#xD;
Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303, 308 (1880). Un-&#xD;
doubtedly, the overriding interest in eradicating discrimi-&#xD;
nation from our civic institutions suffers whenever an&#xD;
individual is excluded from making a significant contribu-&#xD;
tion to governance on account of his race. Yet the “harm&#xD;
from discriminatory jury selection extends beyond that&#xD;
inflicted on the defendant and the excluded juror to touch&#xD;
the entire community. Selection procedures that purpose-&#xD;
fully exclude black persons from juries undermine public&#xD;
confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.” Bat-&#xD;
son, 476 U. S., at 87; see also Smith v. Texas, 311 U. S.&#xD;
128, 130 (1940) (“For racial discrimination to result in the&#xD;
exclusion from jury service of otherwise qualified groups&#xD;
not only violates our Constitution and the laws enacted&#xD;
&#xD;
——————&#xD;
   7 This explanation comports with our interpretation of the burden-&#xD;
&#xD;
shifting framework in cases arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights&#xD;
Act of 1964. See, e.g., Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U. S. 567,&#xD;
577 (1978) (noting that the McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411&#xD;
U. S. 792 (1973), framework “is merely a sensible, orderly way to&#xD;
evaluate the evidence in light of common experience as it bears on the&#xD;
critical question of discrimination”); see also St. Mary’s Honor Center v.&#xD;
Hicks, 509 U. S. 502, 509–510, and n. 3 (1993) (holding that determina-&#xD;
tions at steps one and two of the McDonnell Douglas framework “can&#xD;
involve no credibility assessment” because “the burden-of-production&#xD;
determination necessarily precedes the credibility-assessment stage,”&#xD;
and that the burden-shifting framework triggered by a defendant’s&#xD;
prima face case is essentially just “a means of ‘arranging the presenta-&#xD;
tion of evidence’ ” (quoting Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust, 487&#xD;
U. S. 977, 986 (1988)).&#xD;

under it but it is at war with our basic concepts of a de-&#xD;
mocratic society and a representative government” (foot-&#xD;
note omitted)).&#xD;
   The Batson framework is designed to produce actual&#xD;
answers to suspicions and inferences that discrimination&#xD;
may have infected the jury selection process. See 476&#xD;
U. S., at 97–98, and n. 20. The inherent uncertainty&#xD;
present in inquiries of discriminatory purpose counsels&#xD;
against engaging in needless and imperfect speculation&#xD;
when a direct answer can be obtained by asking a simple&#xD;
question. See Paulino v. Castro, 371 F. 3d 1083, 1090&#xD;
(CA9 2004) (“[I]t does not matter that the prosecutor&#xD;
might have had good reasons . . . [w]hat matters is the real&#xD;
reason they were stricken” (emphasis deleted)); Holloway&#xD;
v. Horn, 355 F. 3d 707, 725 (CA3 2004) (speculation “does&#xD;
not aid our inquiry into the reasons the prosecutor actu-&#xD;
ally harbored” for a peremptory strike). The three-step&#xD;
process thus simultaneously serves the public purposes&#xD;
Batson is designed to vindicate and encourages “prompt&#xD;
rulings on objections to peremptory challenges without&#xD;
substantial disruption of the jury selection process.”&#xD;
Hernandez v. New York, 500 U. S. 352, 358–359 (1991)&#xD;
(opinion of KENNEDY, J.).&#xD;
   The disagreements among the state-court judges who&#xD;
reviewed the record in this case illustrate the imprecision&#xD;
of relying on judicial speculation to resolve plausible&#xD;
claims of discrimination. In this case the inference of&#xD;
discrimination was sufficient to invoke a comment by the&#xD;
trial judge “that ‘we are very close,’ ” and on review, the&#xD;
California Supreme acknowledged that “it certainly looks&#xD;
suspicious that all three African-American prospective&#xD;
jurors were removed from the jury.” 30 Cal. 4th, at 1307,&#xD;
1326, 71 P. 3d, at 273, 286. Those inferences that dis-&#xD;
crimination may have occurred were sufficient to establish&#xD;
a prima facie case under Batson.&#xD;
   The facts of this case well illustrate that California’s&#xD;

“more likely than not” standard is at odds with the prima&#xD;
facie inquiry mandated by Batson. The judgment of the&#xD;
California Supreme Court is therefore reversed, and the&#xD;
case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent&#xD;
with this opinion.&#xD;

&#xD;
   JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.&#xD;
   The Court says that States “have flexibility in formulat-&#xD;
ing appropriate procedures to comply with Batson [v.&#xD;
Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986)],” ante, at 6, but it then tells&#xD;
California how to comply with “the prima facie inquiry&#xD;
mandated by Batson,” ante, at 11. In Batson itself, this&#xD;
Court disclaimed any intent to instruct state courts on&#xD;
how to implement its holding. 476 U. S., at 99 (“We de-&#xD;
cline, however, to formulate particular procedures to be&#xD;
followed upon a defendant’s timely objection to a prosecu-&#xD;
tor’s challenges”); id., at 99–100, n. 24. According to Bat-&#xD;
son, the Equal Protection Clause requires that prosecutors&#xD;
select juries based on factors other than race—not that&#xD;
litigants bear particular burdens of proof or persuasion.&#xD;
Because Batson’s burden-shifting approach is “a prophy-&#xD;
lactic framework” that polices racially discriminatory jury&#xD;
selection rather than “an independent constitutional&#xD;
command,” Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 555&#xD;
(1987), States have “wide discretion, subject to the mini-&#xD;
mum requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, to ex-&#xD;
periment with solutions to difficult problems of policy,”&#xD;
Smith v. Robbins, 528 U. S. 259, 273 (2000); Dickerson v.&#xD;
United States, 530 U. S. 428, 438–439 (2000). California’s&#xD;
procedure falls comfortably within its broad discretion to&#xD;
craft its own rules of criminal procedure, and I therefore&#xD;
respectfully dissent.&#xD;
