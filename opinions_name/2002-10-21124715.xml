      <p>CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA.</p>
      <p>Sup.Ct. Fla. Certiorari denied. Reported below: 810 So.2d 910.</p>
      <p>Statement of JUSTICE STEVENS respecting the denial of the petition for writ of
         certiorari.</p>
      <p>In response to JUSTICE THOMAS' concurring opinion, I think it appropriate once again to
         emphasize that the denial of a petition for a writ of certiorari does not constitute a
         ruling on the merits. See Knight v. Florida, <span class="citation no-link">

      <p>JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring.</p>


      <span class="num">1</span>
      <p>In the three years since we last debated this meritless claim in Knight v. Florida, <span
            class="citation no-link">
            <span class="volume">528</span>
            <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
            <span class="page">990</span>
         </span> (1999) (THOMAS, J., concurring), nothing has changed in our constitutional
            jurisprudence.<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s" id="fn-s_ref">*</a> I therefore have
         little to add to my previous assessment of JUSTICE BREYER's musings. See id., at 992
         ("Consistency would seem to demand that those who accept our death penalty jurisprudence as
         a given also accept the lengthy delay between sentencing and execution as a necessary
         consequence").</p>


      <span class="num">2</span>
      <p>This Court's vacatur of a death sentence because of constitutional error does not bar new
         sentencing proceedings resulting in a reimposition of the death penalty. Petitioner seeks
         what we would not grant to a death-row inmate who had suffered the most egregious of
         constitutional errors in his sentencing proceedings&amp;#8212;a permanent bar to execution.
         Murderers such as petitioner who are not apprehended and tried suffer from the fear and
         anxiety that they will one day be caught and punished for their crimes&amp;#8212;perhaps
         even sentenced to death. Will JUSTICE BREYER next have us consider the constitutionality of
         capital murder trials that occur long after the commission of the crime simply because the
         criminal defendants, who have evaded capture, have been so long suffering?</p>


      <span class="num">3</span>
      <p>Petitioner could long ago have ended his "anxieties and uncertainties," post, at 993, by
         submitting to what the people of Florida have deemed him to deserve: execution. Moreover,
         this judgment would not have been made had petitioner not slit Julian Lanier's throat,
         dragged him into bushes, and then, when petitioner realized that he could hear Lanier
         breathing, cut his spine. 369 So.2d 928, 929 (Fla. 1979).</p>



      <p>Notes:</p>


      <a class="footnote" href="#fn-s_ref">*</a>
      <p> JUSTICE BREYER notes that the Supreme Court of Canada has expressed concern over delays in
         the administration of the death penalty in the United StatesPost, at 992-993 (dissenting
         opinion). I daresay that court would be even more alarmed were there, as Blackstone
         commended, only a 48-hour delay between sentence and execution. Knight, 528 U.S., at
         990-991, n. 1 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (citing 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *397). In any
         event, JUSTICE BREYER has only added another foreign court to his list while still failing
         to ground support for his theory in any decision by an American court. 528 U.S., at 990.
         While Congress, as a legislature, may wish to consider the actions of other nations on any
         issue it likes, this Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence should not impose foreign
         moods, fads, or fashions on Americans. Cf. Atkins v. Virginia, <span class="citation">

      <p>JUSTICE BREYER, dissenting.</p>


      <span class="num">5</span>
      <p>Petitioner Charles Foster has spent more than 27 years in prison since his initial sentence
         of death. He was sentenced to death on October 4, 1975. In 1981, five days before his
         scheduled execution, a Federal District Court issued a stay to permit consideration of his
         first federal habeas petition. This petition was temporarily successful. The Court of
         Appeals held that Foster's sentence was constitutionally defective because the trial court
         had failed to state required findings regarding mitigating factors. But four months later
         the court withdrew relief, saying that it had wrongly raised the question sua sponte.

      <span class="num">6</span>
      <p>In 1984, a second death warrant issued. The courts again stayed the execution. From 1987 to
         1992, the Florida courts twice vacated Foster's sentence because the trial court had failed
         properly to consider certain mitigating factors. New sentencing proceedings followed. Each
         time Foster was again sentenced to death. Foster's latest resentencing took place in 1993,
         18 years after his initial sentence and 10 years after the Court of Appeals first found
         error.</p>


      <span class="num">7</span>
      <p>Foster now asks this Court to consider his claim that his execution, following these
         lengthy proceedings, would violate the Constitution's prohibition of "cruel and unusual
         punishments." JUSTICE STEVENS and I have previously argued that the Court should hear this
         kind of claim. See Lackey v. Texas, <span class="citation no-link">
            <span class="volume">514</span>
            <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
            <span class="page">1045</span>

            class="citation no-link">
            <span class="volume">525</span>

         </span>, 993-999 (1999) (BREYER, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). And I believe
         the present case presents circumstances particularly fitting for this Court's review.</p>


      <span class="num">8</span>
      <p>For one thing, 27 years awaiting execution is unusual by any standard, even that of current
         practice in the United States, where the average executed prisoner spends between 11 and 12
         years under sentence of death, U.S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics
         Bulletin, T. Snell, Capital Punishment 2000, p. 12 (Dec. 2001). A little over two years
         ago, there were only eight prisoners in the United States who had been under sentence of
         death for 24 years or more, and none who had been on death row for 27 years. Id., at 13.
         Now we know there is at least one.</p>


      <span class="num">9</span>
      <p>For another thing, as JUSTICE STEVENS and I have previously pointed out, the combination of
         uncertainty of execution and long delay is arguably "cruel." This Court has recognized that
         such a combination can inflict "horrible feelings" and "an immense mental anxiety amounting
         to a great increase of the offender's punishment." In re Medley, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/tyy/medley/">
               <span class="volume">134</span>
               <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>

            </a>
         </span>, 172 (1890); see also Furman v. Georgia, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/yhv/furman-v-georgia/">
               <span class="volume">408</span>
               <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
               <span class="page">238</span>
            </a>
         </span>, 288-289 (1972) (per curiam) (Brennan, J., concurring) ("[T]he prospect of pending
         execution exacts a frightful toll"). Courts of other nations have found that delays of 15
         years or less can render capital punishment degrading, shocking, or cruel. E. g., Pratt v.
         Attorney General for Jamaica, [1994] 2 A. C. 1, 29, 33, 4 All E. R. 769, 783, 786 (P. C.
         1993) (en bane) (U. K. Privy Council); Soering v. United Kingdom, 11 Eur. Ct. H.R. (ser.
         A), pp. 439, 478, &amp;#182; 111 (1989) (European Court of Human Rights). See Knight,
         supra, at 995-996. Consistent with these determinations, the Supreme Court of Canada
         recently held that the potential for lengthy incarceration before execution is "a relevant
         consideration" when determining whether extradition to the United States violates
         principles of "fundamental justice." United States v. Burns, [2001] 1 S. C. R. 283, 353,
         &amp;#182; 123. Just as "attention to the judgment of other nations" can help Congress
         determine "the justice and propriety of [America's] measures," The Federalist No. 63, p.
         382 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison), so it can help guide this Court when it decides
         whether a particular punishment violates the Eighth Amendment. Cf. Atkins v. Virginia,
            <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/C1W/atkins-v-virginia/">
               <span class="volume">536</span>
               <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
               <span class="page">304</span>
            </a>
         </span>, 316-317, n. 21 (2002).</p>


      <span class="num">10</span>
      <p>Foster has endured an extraordinarily long confinement under sentence of death, a
         confinement that extends from late youth to later middle age. The length of this
         confinement has resulted partly from the State's repeated procedural errors. Death row's
         inevitable anxieties and uncertainties have been sharpened by the issuance of two death
         warrants and three judicial reprieves. If executed, Foster, now 55, will have been punished
         both by death and also by more than a generation spent in death row's twilight. It is
         fairly asked whether such punishment is both unusual and cruel.</p>


      <span class="num">11</span>
      <p>I would grant the petition for certiorari in this case.</p>
