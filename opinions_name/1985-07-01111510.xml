         <span class="star-pagination">*571</span> JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the
         Court.</p>
      <p>This case requires the Court to revisit the data-consideration provision of the Federal
         Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), 61 Stat. 163, as amended, 7 U. S. C. ยง
         136 et seq., which was considered last Term in Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986
         (1984). Monsanto examined whether FIFRA's data-consideration provision effects an
         uncompensated taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment. In this case we address whether
         Article III of the Constitution prohibits Congress from selecting binding arbitration with
         only limited judicial review as the mechanism for resolving disputes among participants in
         FIFRA's pesticide registration scheme. We conclude it does not and reverse the judgment
         below.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>I</h2>
      <p>The Court's opinion in Monsanto details the development of FIFRA from the licensing and
         labeling statute enacted in 1947 to the comprehensive regulatory statute of the present.
         This case, like Monsanto, concerns the most recent amendment to FIFRA, the Federal
         Pesticide Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 819 (1978 Act), which sought to correct problems created by
         the Federal Environmental Pesticide Control Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 973 (1972 Act), itself a
         major revision of prior law. See Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., supra, at 991-992.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>A</h2>
      <p>As a precondition for registration of a pesticide, manufacturers must submit research data
         to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concerning the product's health, safety, and
         environmental effects. The 1972 Act established data-sharing provisions intended to
         streamline pesticide registration procedures, increase competition, and avoid unnecessary
         duplication of data-generation costs. S. Rep. No. 92-838, pp. 72-73 (1972) (1972 S. Rep.).
         Some evidence suggests that before 1972 data submitted by one registrant <span
            class="star-pagination">*572</span> had "as a matter of practice but without statutory
         authority, been considered by the Administrator to support the registration of the same or
         a similar product by another registrant." Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., supra, at 1009, n.
         14. Such registrations were colloquially known as "me too" or "follow-on" registrations.
         Section 3(c)(1)(D) of the 1972 Act provided statutory authority for the use of previously
         submitted data as well as a scheme for sharing the costs of data generation.</p> "In
      effect, the provision instituted a mandatory data-licensing scheme. The amount of compensation
      was to be negotiated by the parties, or, in the event negotiations failed, was to be
      determined by the EPA, subject to judicial review upon instigation of the original data
      submitter. The scope of the 1972 data-consideration provision, however, was limited, for any
      data designated as `trade secrets or commercial or financial information'. . . could not be
      considered at all by EPA to support another registration unless the original submitter
      consented." Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., supra, at 992-993. <p>Congress enacted the original
         data-compensation provision in 1972 because it believed "recognizing a limited proprietary
         interest" in data submitted to support pesticide registrations would provide an added
         incentive beyond statutory patent protection for research and development of new
         pesticides. H. R. Rep. No. 95-663, pp. 17-18 (1977); S. Rep. No. 95-334, pp. 7, 34-40
         (1977) (1977 S. Rep.). The data submitters, however, contended that basic health, safety,
         and environmental data essential to registration of a competing pesticide qualified for
         protection as a trade secret. With EPA bogged down in cataloging data and the pesticide
         industry embroiled in litigation over what types of data could legitimately be designated
         "trade secrets," new pesticide registrations "ground to a virtual halt." Id., at 3.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*573</span> The 1978 amendments were a response to the
         "logjam of litigation that resulted from controversies over data compensation and trade
         secret protection." Ibid. Congress viewed data-sharing as essential to the registration
         scheme, id., at 7, but concluded EPA must be relieved of the task of valuation because
         disputes regarding the compensation scheme had "for all practical purposes, tied up their
         registration process" and "[EPA] lacked the expertise necessary to establish the proper
         amount of compensation." 123 Cong. Rec. 25709 (1977) (statement of Sen. Leahy, floor
         manager of S. 1678). Legislators and the Agency agreed that "[d]etermining the amount and
         terms of such compensation are matters that do not require active government involvement
         [and] compensation payable should be determined to the fullest extent practicable, within
         the private sector." Id., at 25710.</p>
      <p>Against this background, Congress in 1978 amended ยง 3(c)(1)(D) and ยง 10(b) to clarify that
         the trade secret exemption from the data-consideration provision did not extend to health,
         safety, and environmental data. In addition, the 1978 amendments granted data submitters a
         10-year period of exclusive use for data submitted after September 30, 1978, during which
         time the data may not be cited without the original submitter's permission. ยง
         3(c)(1)(D)(i).</p>
      <p>Regarding compensation for use of data not protected by the 10-year exclusive use
         provision, the amendment substituted for the EPA Administrator's determination of the
         appropriate compensation a system of negotiation and binding arbitration to resolve
         compensation disputes among registrants. Section 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) authorizes EPA to consider
         data already in its files in support of a new registration, permit, or new use, but "only
         if the applicant has made an offer to compensate the original data submitter." If the
         applicant and data submitter fail to agree, either may invoke binding arbitration. The
         arbitrator's decision is subject to judicial review only for "fraud, misrepresentation, or
         other <span class="star-pagination">*574</span> misconduct." Ibid.<span class="sup"
            >[1]</span> The statute contains its own sanctions. Should an applicant or data
         submitter fail to comply with the scheme, the Administrator is required to cancel the <span
            class="star-pagination">*575</span> new registration or to consider the data without
         compensation to the original submitter. The Administrator may also issue orders regarding
         sale or use of existing pesticide stocks. Ibid.</p>
      <p>The concept of retaining statutory compensation but substituting binding arbitration for
         valuation of data by EPA emerged as a compromise. This approach was developed by
         representatives of the major chemical manufacturers, who sought to retain the controversial
         compensation provision, in discussions with industry groups representing follow-on
         registrants, whose attempts to register pesticides had been roadblocked by litigation since
         1972. Hearings on Extending and Amending FIFRA before the Subcommittee on Department
         Investigations, Oversight, and Research of the House Committee on Agriculture, 95th Cong.,
         1st Sess., 522-523 (1977) (testimony of Robert Alikonis, General Counsel to Pesticide
         Formulators Association).</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>B</h2>
      <p>Appellees are 13 large firms engaged in the development and marketing of chemicals used to
         manufacture pesticides. <span class="star-pagination">*576</span> Each has in the past
         submitted data to EPA in support of registrations of various pesticides. When the 1978
         amendments went into effect, these firms were engaged in litigation in the Southern
         District of New York challenging the constitutionality under Article I and the Fifth
         Amendment of the provisions authorizing data-sharing and disclosure of data to the
            public.<span class="sup">[2]</span> In response to this Court's decision in Northern
         Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50 (1982), appellees amended
         their complaint to allege that the statutory mechanism of binding arbitration for
         determining the amount of compensation due them violates Article III of the Constitution.
         Article III, ยง 1, provides that "[t]he judicial Power of the United States, shall be
         vested" in courts whose judges enjoy tenure "during good Behaviour" and compensation that
         "shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office." Appellees allege Congress in
         FIFRA transgressed this limitation by allocating to arbitrators the functions of judicial
         officers and severely limiting review by an Article III court.</p>
      <p>The District Court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment on their Article III
         claims. It found the issues ripe because the "statutory compulsion to seek relief through
         arbitration" raised a constitutionally sufficient case or controversy. <span
            class="star-pagination">*577</span> Although troubled by what appeared a "standardless
         delegation of powers," the District Court did not reach the Article I issue because it held
         that Article III barred FIFRA's "absolute assignment of [judicial] power" to arbitrators
         with only limited review by Article III judges. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co. v.
         Ruckelshaus, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/nysd/8E3Y/union-carbide-agr-products-co-v-ruckleshaus/">

            </a>
         </span>, 124 (1983). The District Court, rather than striking down the statutory limitation
         on judicial review, enjoined the entire FIFRA data use and compensation scheme. App. to
         Juris. Statement 25a.</p>
      <p>Appellant took a direct appeal to this Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C. ยง 1252. We vacated the
         judgment of the District Court and remanded for reconsideration in light of our supervening
         decision in Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986 (1984). Ruckelshaus v. Union Carbide
         Agricultural Products Co., 468 U. S. 1201 (1984). In Monsanto, we ruled that FIFRA's
         data-consideration provisions may be deemed a "public use" even though the most direct
         beneficiaries of the regulatory scheme will be the later applicants. 467 U. S., at 1014.
         Insofar as FIFRA authorizes the Administrator to consider trade secrets submitted during
         the period between 1972 and 1978, a period during which the registrant entertained a
         reasonable, investment-backed expectation that its trade secret data would be held
         confidential, we held it effects a taking. But the data originator must complete
         arbitration and, in the event of a shortfall, exhaust its Tucker Act remedies against the
         United States before it can be ascertained whether it has been deprived of just
         compensation. The Court distinguished between the "ability to vindicate [the]
         constitutional right to just compensation" and the "ability to vindicate [the] statutory
         right to obtain compensation from a subsequent applicant." Id., at 1019. But we declined to
         reach Monsanto's Article III claim, explaining:</p> "Monsanto did not allege or establish
      that it had been injured by actual arbitration under the statute. While the District Court
      acknowledged that Monsanto had received <span class="star-pagination">*578</span> several
      offers of compensation from applicants for registration, it did not find that EPA had
      considered Monsanto's data in considering another application. Further, Monsanto and any
      subsequent applicant may negotiate and reach agreement concerning an outstanding offer. If
      they do not reach agreement, then the controversy must go to arbitration. Only after EPA has
      considered data submitted by Monsanto in evaluating another application and an arbitrator has
      made an award will Monsanto's claims with respect to the constitutionality of the arbitration
      scheme become ripe." Ibid. (citation omitted). <p>On remand in this case, appellees amended
         their complaint to reflect that EPA had, in fact, considered their data in support of other
         registration applications. The amended complaint also alleged that data submitted by
         appellee Stauffer Chemical Company (Stauffer), originator of the chemical butylate and
         EPTC, had been used in connection with registrations by PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG), and
         Drexel Chemical Company of pesticides containing butylate and EPTC as active ingredients.
         App. 23. The complaint further alleged Stauffer had invoked the arbitration provisions of ยง
         3(c)(1)(D)(ii) against PPG, and appellees entered in evidence the award of the arbitration
         panel, handed down on June 28, 1983. Id., at 42. Stauffer claimed the arbitrators' award
         fell far short of the compensation to which it was entitled.<span class="sup">[3]</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*579</span> In view of these developments, the District Court
         concluded that "[t]he claims presented by Stauffer challenging the constitutionality of
         FIFRA ยง 3(c)(1)(D) are ripe for resolution under the criteria established by the Supreme
         Court" in Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., supra. The remaining plaintiffs, the District Court
         held, were aggrieved by the clear threat of compulsion to resort to unconstitutional
         arbitration. App. to Juris. Statement 1a-4a. The District Court reinstated its prior
         judgment enjoining the operation of the data-consideration provisions as violative of
         Article III. EPA again took a direct appeal and we noted probable jurisdiction. 469 U. S.
         1032 (1984). This Court stayed the judgment pending disposition of the appeal.</p>

      <h2>II</h2>
      <p>As a threshold matter, we must determine whether appellees' Article III claims demonstrate
         sufficient ripeness to establish a concrete case or controversy. Regional Rail
         Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102, 138-139 (1974). Appellant contends that the
         District Court erred in addressing these claims because the criteria established in
         Monsanto for ripeness remained unsatisfied. Appellant argues that only one firm, Stauffer,
         engaged in arbitration and it seeks to enforce rather than challenge the award. Appellees
         counter that they are aggrieved by the threat of an unconstitutional arbitration procedure
         which assigns the valuation of their data to civil arbitrators and prohibits judicial
         review of the amount of compensation. Stauffer in particular argues that it was doubly
         injured by the arbitration. Although it claimed a shortfall of some $50 million, it was
         precluded by ยง 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) from seeking judicial review of the award against PPG. While
         seeking to enforce the award should its Article III claim fail, Stauffer has consistently
         challenged the validity of the entire FIFRA data-consideration scheme both here and in
         litigation initiated by PPG. See n. 3, supra.</p>
      <p>We agree that Stauffer has an independent right to adjudication in a constitutionally
         proper forum. See Glidden Co. <span class="star-pagination">*580</span> v. Zdanok, 370 U.
         S. 530, 533 (1962). Although appellees contend and the District Court found that they were
         injured by the shortfall in the award, it is sufficient for purposes of a claim under
         Article III challenging a tribunal's jurisdiction that the claimant demonstrate it has been
         or inevitably will be subjected to an exercise of such unconstitutional jurisdiction. See
         Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S., at 56-57, aff'g 12
         B. R. 946 (Minn. 1981) (reversing Bankruptcy Court's denial of pretrial motion to dismiss
         contract claim). "[A party] may object to proceeding further with [a] lawsuit on the
         grounds that if it is to be resolved by an agency of the United States, it may be resolved
         only by an agency which exercises `[t]he judicial power of the United States' described by
         Art. III of the Constitution." 458 U. S., at 89 (opinion concurring in judgment). In
         contrast to the Taking Clause claim in Monsanto, appellees' Article III injury is not a
         function of whether the tribunal awards reasonable compensation but of the tribunal's
         authority to adjudicate the dispute. Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe
         Line Co., supra; Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, supra. Thus appellees state an independent claim
         under Article III, apart from any monetary injury sustained as a result of the
         arbitration.</p>
      <p>"[R]ipeness is peculiarly a question of timing." Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases,
         supra, at 140. "[I]ts basic rationale is to prevent the courts, through premature
         adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements." Abbott Laboratories v.
         Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 148 (1967). The Article III challenge in Monsanto was, in this
         sense, premature. Monsanto had not alleged that its data had ever been considered in
         support of other registrations, much less that Monsanto had failed to reach a negotiated
         settlement or been forced to resort to an unconstitutional arbitration. In fact, no FIFRA
         arbitrations had as yet taken place when Monsanto brought its claim. Monsanto's claim thus
         involved "contingent future events that may not <span class="star-pagination">*581</span>
         occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all." 13A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp;amp;
         E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 3532 (1984). By contrast, the FIFRA
         data-consideration procedures are now in place and numerous follow-on registrations have
         been issued. See Brief for Appellees 3, n. 3 (citing Docket Entry No. 132, p. 2). Each of
         the appellees in this action has alleged as yet uncompensated use of its data. App. 23.
         Stauffer has engaged in an arbitration lasting many months and consuming 2,700 pages of
         transcript. There is no doubt that the "effects [of the arbitration scheme] have [been felt
         by Stauffer] in a concrete way." Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S., at 148-149.</p>
      <p>In addition, "the fitness of the issues for judicial decision" and "the hardship to the
         parties of withholding court consideration" must inform any analysis of ripeness. Id., at
         149. The issue presented in this case is purely legal, and will not be clarified by further
         factual development. Cf. Pacific Gas &amp;amp; Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources
         Conservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U. S. 190, 201 (1983). Doubts about the validity
         of FIFRA's data-consideration and compensation schemes have plagued the pesticide industry
         and seriously hampered the effectiveness of FIFRA's reforms of the registration process.
         "To require the industry to proceed without knowing whether the [arbitration scheme] is
         valid would impose a palpable and considerable hardship." Id., at 201-202. At a minimum
         Stauffer, and arguably each appellee whose data have been used pursuant to the challenged
         scheme, suffers the continuing uncertainty and expense of depending for compensation on a
         process whose authority is undermined because its constitutionality is in question. See
         ibid. " `One does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain
         preventive relief. If the injury is certainly impending, that is enough.' " Regional Rail
         Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S., at 143, <span class="star-pagination">*582</span>
         quoting Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553, 593 (1923). Nothing would be gained
         by postponing a decision, and the public interest would be well served by a prompt
         resolution of the constitutionality of FIFRA's arbitration scheme. Duke Power Co. v.
         Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 82 (1978).</p>
      <p>Finally, appellees clearly have standing to contest EPA's issuance of follow-on
         registrations pursuant to what they contend is an unconstitutional statutory provision.
         They allege an injury from EPA's unlawful conduct &#x97; the injury of being forced to
         choose between relinquishing any right to compensation from a follow-on registrant or
         engaging in an unconstitutional adjudication. Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737 (1984).
         Appellees also allege injury which is likely to be redressed by the relief they request.
         Ibid. The use, registration, and compensation scheme is integrated in a single subsection
         that explicitly ties the follow-on registration to the arbitration. See ยง 3(c)(1)(D)(ii)
         (EPA "shall deny" or "cancel" follow-on registration if arbitration section is not complied
         with). It is evident that Congress linked EPA's authority to issue follow-on registrations
         to the original data submitter's ability to obtain compensation. A decision against the
         provision's constitutionality, therefore, would support remedies such as striking down the
         statutory restrictions on judicial review or enjoining EPA from issuing or retaining in
         force follow-on registrations pursuant to ยง 3(c)(1)(D)(ii).</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>III</h2>
      <p>Appellees contend that Article III bars Congress from requiring arbitration of disputes
         among registrants concerning compensation under FIFRA without also affording substantial
         review by tenured judges of the arbitrator's decision. Article III, ยง 1, establishes a
         broad policy that federal judicial power shall be vested in courts whose judges enjoy life
         tenure and fixed compensation. These requirements protect <span class="star-pagination"
            >*583</span> the role of the independent judiciary within the constitutional scheme of
         tripartite government and assure impartial adjudication in federal courts. United States v.
         Will, 449 U. S. 200, 217-218 (1980); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 122 (1976) (per
         curiam).</p>
      <p>An absolute construction of Article III is not possible in this area of "frequently arcane
         distinctions and confusing precedents." Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe
         Line Co., 458 U. S., at 90 (opinion concurring in judgment). "[N]either this Court nor
         Congress has read the Constitution as requiring every federal question arising under the
         federal law . . . to be tried in an Art. III court before a judge enjoying life tenure and
         protection against salary reduction." Palmore v. United States, 411 U. S. 389, 407 (1973).
         Instead, the Court has long recognized that Congress is not barred from acting pursuant to
         its powers under Article I to vest decisionmaking authority in tribunals that lack the
         attributes of Article III courts. See, e. g., Walters v. National Assn. of Radiation
         Survivors, ante, p. 305 (Board of Veterans' Appeals); Palmore v. United States, supra
         (District of Columbia courts); Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22 (1932) (Deputy Commissioner

         precise scope and nature of Article III's limitations. The Court's holding in that case
         establishes only that Congress may not vest in a non-Article III court the power to
         adjudicate, render final judgment, and issue binding orders in a traditional contract
         action arising under state law, without consent of the litigants, and subject only to
         ordinary appellate review. 458 U. S., at 84 (plurality opinion); id., at 90-92 (opinion
         concurring in judgment); id., at 92 (BURGER, C. J., dissenting).</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>A</h2>
      <p>Appellees contend that their claims to compensation under FIFRA are a matter of state law,
         and thus are encompassed by the holding of Northern Pipeline. We disagree. Any right to
         compensation from follow-on registrants under ยง 3 (c)(1)(D)(ii) for EPA's use of data
         results from FIFRA and does not depend on or replace a right to such compensation under
         state law. Cf. Northern Pipeline Construction Co., supra, at 84 (plurality opinion)
         (contract claims at issue were matter of state law); Crowell v. Benson, supra, at 39-40
         (replacing traditional admiralty negligence action with administrative scheme of strict
         liability). As a matter of state law, property rights in a trade secret are extinguished
         when a company discloses its trade secret to persons not obligated to protect the
         confidentiality of the information. See Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S., at 1002,
         citing R. Milgrim, Trade Secrets ยง 1.01[2] (1983). Therefore registrants who submit data
         with notice of the scheme established by the 1978 amendments, and its qualified protection
         of trade secrets as defined in ยง 10, can claim no property interest under state law in data
         subject to ยง 3(c)(1)(D)(ii). Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., supra, at 1005-1008. Cf. 21 U. S.
         C. ยงยง 348(a)(2), 376(a)(1); 21 CFR ยง 71.15 (1985); 21 CFR ยง 171.1(h) (1984) (data submitted
         under Food, Drug, <span class="star-pagination">*585</span> and Cosmetic Act is in public
         domain and follow-on registrants need not submit independent data). Nor do individuals who
         submitted data prior to 1978 have a right to compensation under FIFRA that depends on state
         law. To be sure, such users might have a claim that the new scheme results in a taking of
         property interests protected by state law. See 467 U. S., at 1013-1014. Compensation for
         any uncompensated taking is available under the Tucker Act. For purposes of compensation
         under FIFRA's regulatory scheme, however, it is the "mandatory licensing provision" that
         creates the relationship between the data submitter and the follow-on registrant, and
         federal law supplies the rule of decision. Cf. Northern Pipeline Construction Co., supra,
         at 90 (opinion concurring in judgment).</p>
      <p>Alternatively, appellees contend that FIFRA confers a "private right" to compensation,
         requiring either Article III adjudication or review by an Article III court sufficient to
         retain "the essential attributes of the judicial power." Northern Pipeline Construction
         Co., supra, at 77, 85-86 (plurality opinion). This "private right" argument rests on the
         distinction between public and private rights drawn by the plurality in Northern Pipeline.
         The Northern Pipeline plurality construed the Court's prior opinions to permit only three
         clearly defined exceptions to the rule of Article III adjudication: military tribunals,
         territorial courts, and decisions involving "public" as opposed to "private" rights.
         Drawing upon language in Crowell v. Benson, supra, at 50, the plurality defined "public
         rights" as "matters arising between the Government and persons subject to its authority in
         connection with the performance of the constitutional functions of the executive or
         legislative departments." 458 U. S., at 67-68. It identified "private rights" as " `the
         liability of one individual to another under the law as defined.' " Id., at 69-70, quoting
         Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S., at 51.</p>
      <p>This theory that the public rights/private rights dichotomy of Crowell and Murray's Lessee
         v. Hoboken Land &amp;amp; Improvement <span class="star-pagination">*586</span> Co., <span
            class="citation">

         </span> (1856), provides a bright-line test for determining the requirements of Article III
         did not command a majority of the Court in Northern Pipeline. Insofar as appellees
         interpret that case and Crowell as establishing that the right to an Article III forum is
         absolute unless the Federal Government is a party of record, we cannot agree. Cf. Northern
         Pipeline Construction Co., 458 U. S., at 71 (plurality opinion) (noting that discharge in
         bankruptcy, which adjusts liabilities between individuals, is arguably a public right). But
         see id., at 69, n. 23. Nor did a majority of the Court endorse the implication of the
         private right/public right dichotomy that Article III has no force simply because a dispute
         is between the Government and an individual. Compare id., at 68, n. 20, with id., at 70, n.
         23.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>B</h2>
      <p>Chief Justice Hughes, writing for the Court in Crowell, expressly rejected a formalistic or
         abstract Article III inquiry, stating:</p> "In deciding whether the Congress, in enacting
      the statute under review, has exceeded the limits of its authority to prescribe procedure . .
      . , regard must be had, as in other cases where constitutional limits are invoked, not to mere
      matters of form but to the substance of what is required." 285 U. S., at 53 (emphasis added).
         <p>Crowell held that Congress could replace a seaman's traditional negligence action in
         admiralty with a statutory scheme of strict liability. In response to practical concerns,
         Congress rejected adjudication in Article III courts and instead provided that claims for
         compensation would be determined in an administrative proceeding by a deputy commissioner
         appointed by the United States Employees' Compensation Commission. Id., at 43. "[T]he
         findings of the deputy commissioner, supported by evidence and within the scope of his
         authority" were final with respect to injuries to employees within the purview of the
         statute. Id., at 46. Although <span class="star-pagination">*587</span> such findings
         clearly concern obligations among private parties, this fact did not make the scheme
         invalid under Article III. Instead, after finding that the administrative proceedings
         satisfied due process, id., at 45-58, Crowell concluded that the judicial review afforded
         by the statute, including review of matters of law, "provides for the appropriate exercise
         of the judicial function in this class of cases." Id., at 54.</p>
      <p>The enduring lesson of Crowell is that practical attention to substance rather than
         doctrinaire reliance on formal categories should inform application of Article III. Cf.
         Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S., at 547-548. The extent of judicial review afforded by the
         legislation reviewed in Crowell does not constitute a minimal requirement of Article III
         without regard to the origin of the right at issue or the concerns guiding the selection by
         Congress of a particular method for resolving disputes. In assessing the degree of judicial
         involvement required by Article III in this case, we note that the statute considered in
         Crowell is different from FIFRA in significant respects. Most importantly, the statute in
         Crowell displaced a traditional cause of action and affected a pre-existing relationship
         based on a common-law contract for hire. Thus it clearly fell within the range of matters
         reserved to Article III courts under the holding of Northern Pipeline. See 458 U. S., at
         70-71, and n. 25 (plurality opinion) (noting that matters subject to a "suit at common law
         or in equity or admiralty" are at "protected core" of Article III judicial powers); id., at
         90 (opinion concurring in judgment) (noting that state law contract actions are "the stuff
         of the traditional actions at common law tried by the courts at Westminster in 1789").</p>
      <p>If the identity of the parties alone determined the requirements of Article III, under
         appellees' theory the constitutionality of many quasi-adjudicative activities carried on by
         administrative agencies involving claims between individuals would be thrown into doubt.

         383 U. S. 301, 333 (1966), the Court upheld as constitutional a provision of the Railway
         Labor Act that established a "right" of a majority of a craft or class to choose its
         bargaining representative and vested the resolution of disputes concerning representation
         solely in the National Mediation Board, without judicial review. The Court concluded:</p>
      "The Act . . . writes into law the `right' of the `majority of any craft or class of
      employees' to `determine who shall be the representative of the craft or class for purposes of
      this Act.' That `right' is protected by [a provision] which gives the Mediation Board the
      power to resolve controversies concerning it . . . . A review by the federal district courts

      <p>The Court has treated as a matter of "public right" an essentially adversary proceeding to
         invoke tariff protections against a competitor, as well as an administrative proceeding to
         determine the rights of landlords and tenants. See Atlas <span class="star-pagination"

         454-455 (1977), citing as an example of "public rights" the federal landlord/tenant law
         discussed in Block v. Hirsh, 256 U. S. 135 (1921); Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S. 438,
         447 (1929) (tariff dispute). These proceedings surely determine liabilities of individuals.
         Such schemes would be beyond the power of Congress under appellees' interpretation of
         Crowell. In essence, the public rights doctrine reflects simply a pragmatic understanding
         that when Congress selects a quasi-judicial method of resolving matters that "could be
         conclusively determined by the Executive and Legislative Branches," the danger of
         encroaching on the judicial powers is reduced. Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v.

      <h2>C</h2>
      <p>Looking beyond form to the substance of what FIFRA accomplishes, we note several aspects of
         FIFRA that persuade us the arbitration scheme adopted by Congress does not contravene
         Article III. First, the right created by FIFRA is not a purely "private" right, but bears
         many of the characteristics of a "public" right. Use of a registrant's data to support a
         follow-on registration serves a public purpose as an integral part of a program
         safeguarding the public health. Congress has the power, under Article I, to authorize an
         agency administering a complex regulatory scheme to allocate costs and benefits among
         voluntary participants in the program without providing an Article III adjudication. It
         also has the power to condition issuance of registrations or licenses on compliance with
         agency procedures. Article III is not so inflexible that it bars Congress from shifting the
         task of data valuation from the agency to the interested parties. Cf. United States v.
         Erika, Inc., 456 U. S., at 203 (private insurance carrier assigned task of deciding
         Medicare claims); Crowell v. Benson, supra, at 50-51.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*590</span> The 1978 amendments represent a pragmatic
         solution to the difficult problem of spreading the costs of generating adequate information
         regarding the safety, health, and environmental impact of a potentially dangerous product.
         Congress, without implicating Article III, could have authorized EPA to charge follow-on
         registrants fees to cover the cost of data and could have directly subsidized FIFRA data
         submitters for their contributions of needed data. See St. Joseph Stockyards Co. v. United
         States, 298 U. S. 38, 49-53 (1936) (ratemaking is an essentially legislative function).
         Instead, it selected a framework that collapses these two steps into one, and permits the
         parties to fix the amount of compensation, with binding arbitration to resolve intractable
         disputes. Removing the task of valuation from agency personnel to civilian arbitrators,
         selected by agreement of the parties or appointed on a case-by-case basis by an independent
         federal agency, surely does not diminish the likelihood of impartial decisionmaking, free
         from political influence. See 29 CFR ยง 1404.4, pt. 1440, App. ยง 7 (1984). Cf. Northern
         Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 58 (plurality opinion); id., at 115-116 (WHITE, J.,
         dissenting).</p>
      <p>The near disaster of the FIFRA 1972 amendments and the danger to public health of further
         delay in pesticide registration led Congress to select arbitration as the appropriate
         method of dispute resolution. Given the nature of the right at issue and the concerns
         motivating the Legislature, we do not think this system threatens the independent role of
         the Judiciary in our constitutional scheme. "To hold otherwise would be to defeat the
         obvious purpose of the legislation to furnish a prompt, continuous, expert and inexpensive
         method for dealing with a class of questions of fact which are peculiarly suited to
         examination and determination by an administrative agency specially assigned to that task."
         Crowell v. Benson, supra, at 46. Cf. Palmore v. United States, 411 U. S., at 407-408 (the
         requirements of Art. III must in proper circumstances give way to accommodate plenary <span
            class="star-pagination">*591</span> grants of power to Congress to legislate with
         respect to specialized areas); Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land &amp;amp; Improvement Co.,
         18 How., at 282 (citing "[i]mperative necessity" to justify summary tax collection
         procedures).</p>
      <p>We note as well that the FIFRA arbitration scheme incorporates its own system of internal
         sanctions and relies only tangentially, if at all, on the Judicial Branch for enforcement.
         See supra, at 574-575. The danger of Congress or the Executive encroaching on the Article
         III judicial powers is at a minimum when no unwilling defendant is subjected to judicial
         enforcement power as a result of the agency "adjudication." See, e. g., Hart, The Power of
         Congress to Limit the Jurisdiction of Federal Courts: An Exercise in Dialectic, 66 Harv. L.
         Rev. 1362 (1953), reprinted in P. Bator, P. Mishkin, D. Shapiro, &amp;amp; H. Wechsler,
         Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 330 (2d ed. 1973); Monaghan,
         Marbury and the Administrative State, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 16 (1983); L. Jaffe, Judicial
         Control of Administrative Action 385 (1965) (historically judicial review of agency
         decisionmaking has been required only when it results in the use of judicial process to
         enforce an obligation upon an unwilling defendant).</p>
      <p>We need not decide in this case whether a private party could initiate an action in court
         to enforce a FIFRA arbitration. But cf. 29 CFR pt. 1440, App. ยง 37(c) (1984) (under rules
         of American Arbitration Association, parties to arbitration are deemed to consent to entry
         of judgment). FIFRA contains no provision explicitly authorizing a party to invoke judicial
         process to compel arbitration or enforce an award. Compare ยง 3(c)(1)(D)(ii), 7 U. S. C. ยง
         136a(c)(1)(D)(ii), with ยง 10(c), 7 U. S. C. ยง 136h(c) (authorizing applicant or registrant
         to institute action in district court to settle dispute with Administrator over trade
         secrets); 29 U. S. C. ยง 1401 (b)(2) (Employee Retirement Income Security Act provision
         authorizing parties to arbitration to bring enforcement action in district court); Union
         Pacific R. Co. v. Price, 360 U. S., <span class="star-pagination">*592</span> at 614, and
         n. 12 (statute authorized court enforcement of National Railroad Adjustment Board's money
         damages award); and Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S., at 44 (providing for entry of judgment in
         federal court). Cf. Utility Workers v. Edison Co., 309 U. S. 261 (1940) (as award to worker
         vindicates a "public right," agency alone has authority to institute enforcement
         proceeding). In any event, under FIFRA, the only potential object of judicial enforcement
         power is the follow-on registrant who explicitly consents to have his rights determined by
         arbitration. See 40 CFR ยง 162.9-5(b) (1984) (registration application must contain a
         written offer to pay compensation "to the extent required by FIFRA section
         3(c)(1)(D)").</p>
      <p>Finally, we note that FIFRA limits but does not preclude review of the arbitration
         proceeding by an Article III court. We conclude that, in the circumstances, the review
         afforded preserves the "appropriate exercise of the judicial function." Crowell v. Benson,
         supra, at 54. FIFRA at a minimum allows private parties to secure Article III review of the
         arbitrator's "findings and determination" for fraud, misconduct, or misrepresentation. ยง
         3(c)(1)(D)(ii). This provision protects against arbitrators who abuse or exceed their
         powers or willfully misconstrue their mandate under the governing law. Cf. Steelworkers v.
         Enterprise Wheel &amp;amp; Car Corp., 363 U. S. 593, 597 (1960) (arbitrator must be
         faithful to terms of mandate and does not sit to administer his "own brand of industrial
         justice"). Moreover, review of constitutional error is preserved, see Walters v. National
         Assn. of Radiation Survivors, ante, at 311, n. 3; Johnson v. Robison, 415 U. S. 361,
         367-368 (1974), and FIFRA, therefore, does not obstruct whatever judicial review might by
         required by due process. Cf. Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S., at 46; id., at 87 (Brandeis, J.,
         dissenting). We need not identify the extent to which due process may require review of
         determinations by the arbitrator because the parties stipulated below to <span
            class="star-pagination">*593</span> abandon any due process claims.<span class="sup"
            >[4]</span> See n. 2, supra. For purposes of our analysis, it is sufficient to note that
         FIFRA does provide for limited Article III review, including whatever review is
         independently required by due process considerations.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>IV</h2>
      <p>Appellees raise Article I as an alternative ground for sustaining the judgment of the
         District Court. Cf. Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S. 471, 475, n. 6 (1970). Appellees
         argued below that FIFRA's standard for compensation is so vague as to be an
         unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers. See A. L. A. Schecter Poultry Corp. v.
         United States, 295 U. S. 495 (1935). A term that appears vague on its face "may derive much
         meaningful content from the purpose of the Act, its factual background, and the statutory
         context." American Power &amp;amp; Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U. S. 90, 104 (1946). Although
         FIFRA's language does not impose an explicit standard, the legislative history of the 1972
         and 1978 amendments is far from silent. See, e. g., S. Conf. Rep. No. 95-1188, p. 29
         (1978); 1977 S. Rep., at 4, 8, 31; 1972 S. Rep., pt. 2, pp. 69, 72-73; Hearings on
         Extending and Amending FIFRA before the Subcommittee on Department Investigations,
         Oversight, and Research of the House Committee on Agriculture, 95th Cong., 1st Sess.,
         passim (1977). The Article I claim, however, was neither adequately briefed nor argued to
         this Court and was not fully litigated before the District Court. Without expressing any
         opinion on the merits, we leave the issue open for determination on remand.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>V</h2>
      <p>Our holding is limited to the proposition that Congress, acting for a valid legislative
         purpose pursuant to its constitutional <span class="star-pagination">*594</span> powers
         under Article I, may create a seemingly "private" right that is so closely integrated into
         a public regulatory scheme as to be a matter appropriate for agency resolution with limited
         involvement by the Article III judiciary. To hold otherwise would be to erect a rigid and
         formalistic restraint on the ability of Congress to adopt innovative measures such as
         negotiation and arbitration with respect to rights created by a regulatory scheme. For the
         reasons stated in our opinion, we hold that arbitration of the limited right created by
         FIFRA ยง 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) does not contravene Article III. The judgment of the District Court
         is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
         opinion.</p>
      <p>So ordered.</p>
      <p>JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL and JUSTICE BLACKMUN join, concurring in the
         judgment.</p>
      <p>Our cases of both recent and ancient vintage have struggled to pierce through the language
         of Art. III of the Constitution to the full meaning of the deceptively simple requirement
         that "The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in
         such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish." Art. III,
         ยง 1. We know that those who framed our Constitution feared the tyranny of "accumulation of
         all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands," The Federalist No.
         47, p. 300 (H. Lodge ed. 1888) (J. Madison), and sought to guard against it by dispersing
         federal power to three interdependent branches of Government. Each branch of Government was
         intended to exercise a distinct but limited power and function as a check on any
         aggrandizing tendencies in the other branches. See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 122
         (1976) (per curiam). The salary and tenure guarantees of Art. III &#x97; reflecting
         Hamilton's observation that "a power over a man's subsistence amounts <span
            class="star-pagination">*595</span> to a power over his will," The Federalist No. 79, p.
         491 (H. Lodge ed. 1888) &#x97; were thought essential to the Judiciary's ability to
         function effectively as a check on Congress and the Executive. It is thus clear that when
         Congress establishes courts pursuant to Art. III the judges presiding in those courts must
         receive salary and tenure guarantees. The difficult question is to what extent the need to
         preserve the Judiciary's checking function requires Congress to assign the Federal
         Government's decisionmaking authority to independent tribunals so constituted.</p>
      <p>Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50 (1982), is the
         Court's most recent attempt at defining the limits Art. III places on the power of Congress
         to assign adjudicative authority to decisionmakers not protected by tenure and salary
         guarantees. We faced the question whether, under the federal Bankruptcy Act of 1978, 92
         Stat. 2549, a federal bankruptcy court whose decisionmaker did not benefit from those
         guarantees could be empowered to render the entire initial adjudication of a state
         common-law cause of action. The issue was, in other words, whether Art. III permitted
         assignment of any essential attributes of the "judicial Power" to a non-Art. III federal
         decisionmaker when state law prescribed the rule of decision in a dispute between private
         parties. The Court invalidated the congressional action but a majority did not agree upon a
         common rationale. The plurality would have held that this allocation of decisional
         authority could not be justified as a proper exercise of either the congressional power to
         create Art. I legislative courts or the congressional power to create adjuncts to Art. III
         courts. 458 U. S., at 63-87. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, in a concurring opinion joined by JUSTICE
         O'CONNOR, would simply have held that Congress may not assign the power to adjudicate a
         traditional state common-law action to a non-Art. III tribunal even given the "traditional
         appellate review" by an Art. III court afforded under the challenged bankruptcy statute.
         Id., at 90-91.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*596</span> Because the appellees in Northern Pipeline had
         argued that bankruptcy court jurisdiction over state-law contract claims could be justified
         as an exercise of Congress' Art. I power to create legislative courts, the plurality
         examined the basis and scope of that congressional power as it has been explicated in our
         precedents. The plurality concluded that notwithstanding the commands of Art. III Congress
         could create such legislative courts for three categories of cases: territorial courts,
         courts-martial, and courts that adjudicate public rights disputes. The only serious
         question in Northern Pipeline was whether the disputed bankruptcy court jurisdiction fell
         into the third category.</p>
      <p>The plurality opinion concluded that public rights cases, as that concept had come to be
         understood, involved disputes arising from the Federal Government's administration of its
         laws or programs.<span class="sup">[1]</span> 458 U. S., at 68-69. The plurality <span
            class="star-pagination">*597</span> expressly disclaimed any intention to provide a
         generally applicable definition of "public rights" but concluded that at a minimum public
         rights disputes must arise " `between the Government and others.' " Id., at 69, quoting Ex
         parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S. 438, 458 (1929). The dispute at issue in Northern Pipeline
         was found by the plurality not to fall into the public rights category because state law
         created the right and provided the rule of decision as between the private parties
         litigating the dispute, irrespective of the existence of the federal bankruptcy scheme. 458
         U. S., at 72, n. 26 ("Even in the absence of the federal scheme, the plaintiff would be
         able to proceed against the defendant on the state-law contractual claims"). In no sense
         could the dispute be said to be about the propriety or accuracy of a determination made by
         an organ of the Federal Government in administration or execution of a federal regulatory
         scheme. Whatever the precise scope of the public rights doctrine, that case was clearly
         outside it and therefore adjudication before an Art. III decisionmaker or properly
         constituted adjunct was required.<span class="sup">[2]</span> Because the challenged
         bankruptcy jurisdiction could not be sustained on the alternative rationale that it was a
         proper adjunct to an Art. III court, id., at 77-86 (plurality opinion); id., at 91
         (REHNQUIST, J., concurring in judgment), the statute embodying the jurisdictional grant was
         declared unconstitutional.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*598</span> Analysis of the present case properly begins with
         the recognition that it differs substantially from the issue in Northern Pipeline. The
         present case arises entirely within the regulatory confines of the Federal Insecticide,
         Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), 7 U. S. C. ยง 136 et seq. This federal statute
         prescribes both the terms of compensation and the procedures for arriving at the proper
         amount of compensation in any given case. See 7 U. S. C. ยง 136a(c) (1)(D)(ii) (providing
         for negotiation followed by binding arbitration to set amounts "follow-on" registrants must
         pay in compensation for use of test data). Thus the question for decision here is whether
         fixing the amount of compensation for test data under FIFRA can be characterized as a
         public rights dispute that need not be adjudicated from the outset in an Art. III court or
         a properly constituted adjunct to such a court.<span class="sup">[3]</span> Should it be
         concluded that this is such a dispute, the further issue must be confronted of whether some
         form of appellate oversight by an Art. III court is nonetheless required, see Atlas Roofing
         Co. v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n, 430 U. S. 442, 455, n. 13 (1977), and,
         if so, whether this statute's provision of review only for "fraud, misrepresentation, or
         other misconduct" suffices. 7 U. S. C. ยง 136a(c)(1)(D)(ii).</p>
      <p>I agree with the Court that the determinative factor with respect to the proper
         characterization of the nature of the dispute in this case should not be the presence or
         absence of the Government as a party. See ante, at 586. Despite the Court's contrary
         suggestions, the plurality opinion in Northern Pipeline suggests neither that "the right to
         an Article III forum is absolute unless the Federal Government is a party of record" nor
         that "Article III has no force simply because a dispute is between the Government and an
         individual." <span class="star-pagination">*599</span> Ante, at 586. Properly understood,
         the analysis elaborated by the plurality in Northern Pipeline does not place the Federal
         Government in an Art. III straitjacket whenever a dispute technically is one between
         private parties. We recognized that a bankruptcy adjudication, though technically a dispute
         among private parties, may well be properly characterized as a matter of public rights. 458
         U. S., at 50. The plurality opinion's reaffirmation of the constitutionality of the
         administrative scheme at issue in Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22 (1932), similarly
         suggests that a proper interpretation of Art. III affords the Federal Government
         substantial flexibility to rely on administrative tribunals. See Northern Pipeline, 458 U.
         S., at 69, n. 22, 78-80. The plurality opinion should not be read to imply that reliance on
         administrative agencies for ratemaking or other forms of regulatory adjustments of private
         interests is necessarily suspect. Cf. Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U. S. 184, 191 (1958) (BRENNAN,
         J., dissenting).</p>
      <p>Nor does the approach of the Northern Pipeline plurality opinion permit Congress to sap the
         Judiciary of all its checking power whenever the Government is a party. The opinion made
         clear that "the presence of the United States as a proper party to the proceeding is . . .
         not [a] sufficient means of distinguishing `private rights' from `public rights.' " 458 U.
         S., at 69, n. 23. At a minimum, Art. III must bar Congress from assigning to an Art. I
         decisionmaker the ultimate disposition of challenges to the constitutionality of Government
         action, either legislative or executive. Cf. United States v. Raddatz, 447 U. S. 667,
         708-712 (1980) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). Also, the plurality opinion was careful to leave
         open the question whether and to what extent even the resolution of public rights disputes
         might require some eventual review in an Art. III court in the exercise of its
         responsibility to check an impermissible accumulation of power in the other branches of
         Government. 458 U. S., at 70, n. 23; see also id., at 115 (WHITE, J., dissenting) ("[A]
         scheme of <span class="star-pagination">*600</span> Art. I courts that provides for
         appellate review by Art. III courts should be substantially less controversial than a
         legislative attempt entirely to avoid judicial review in a constitutional court"); Atlas
         Roofing Co. v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n, supra, at 455, n. 13. Because
         the approach of the plurality opinion in Northern Pipeline is sufficiently flexible to
         accommodate the demands of contemporary Government while preserving the constitutional
         system of checks and balances, I adhere to it as the proper analysis for resolving the
         present case.</p>
      <p>Though the issue before us in this case is not free of doubt, in my judgment the FIFRA
         compensation scheme challenged in this case should be viewed as involving a matter of
         public rights as that term is understood in the line of cases culminating in Northern
         Pipeline. In one sense the question of proper compensation for a follow-on registrant's use
         of test data is, under the FIFRA scheme, a dispute about "the liability of one individual
         to another under the law as defined," Crowell v. Benson, supra, at 51 (defining matters of
         private right). But the dispute arises in the context of a federal regulatory scheme that
         virtually occupies the field. Congress has decided that effectuation of the public policies
         of FIFRA demands not only a requirement of compensation from "follow-on" registrants in
         return for mandatory access to data but also an administrative process &#x97; mandatory
         negotiation followed by binding arbitration &#x97; to ensure that unresolved compensation
         disputes do not delay public distribution of needed products. This case, in other words,
         involves not only the congressional prescription of a federal rule of decision to govern a
         private dispute but also the active participation of a federal regulatory agency in
         resolving the dispute. Although a compensation dispute under FIFRA ultimately involves a
         determination of the duty owed one private party by another, at its heart the dispute
         involves the exercise of authority by a Federal Government arbitrator in the course of
         administration of FIFRA's comprehensive regulatory <span class="star-pagination"
            >*601</span> scheme. As such it partakes of the characteristics of a standard agency
         adjudication. Cf. Leedom v. Kyne, supra, at 191 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).<span class="sup"
            >[4]</span>
      </p>
      <p>Given that this dispute is properly understood as one involving a matter in which Congress
         has substantial latitude to make use of Art. I decisionmakers, the question remains whether
         the Constitution nevertheless imposes some requirement of Art. III supervision of the
         arbitrator's decisions under this scheme. In this case Congress has provided for review of
         arbitrators' decisions to ensure against "fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct."
         The Court therefore need not reach the difficult question whether Congress is always free
         to cut off all judicial review of decisions respecting such exercises of Art. I
         authority.</p>
      <p>The review prescribed under FIFRA encompasses the authority to invalidate an arbitrator's
         decision when that decision exceeds the arbitrator's authority or exhibits a manifest
         disregard for the governing law. See Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel &amp;amp; Car Corp.,
         363 U. S. 593, 597 (1960); Wilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427, 436-437 (1953). Such review
         preserves the judicial authority over questions of law in the present context. Cf. Crowell
         v. Benson, supra, at 54. In essence, the FIFRA scheme delegates a significant case-by-case
            <span class="star-pagination">*602</span> lawmaking function to the arbitrator in
         compensation disputes. So long as this delegation is constitutionally permissible &#x97; an
         issue left open on remand &#x97; and judicial review to ensure that the arbitrator's
         exercise of authority in any given case does not depart from the mandate of the delegation,
         the Judiciary will exercise a restraining authority sufficient to meet whatever
         requirements Art. III might impose in the present context.<span class="sup">[5]</span>
      </p>
      <p>For these reasons, I agree with the Court that the FIFRA arbitration scheme does not
         violate the mandates of Art. III, and I would therefore reverse the judgment of the
         District Court and remand for further proceedings.</p>
      <p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in the judgment.</p>
      <p>This appeal presents a question under Article III, but one which differs from that
         addressed by the Court and whose answer prevents me from reaching the merits of appellees'
         claims.</p>
      <p>Appellees, plaintiffs in the District Court, challenge the constitutionality of an
         "arbitration procedure that [allegedly] violates their right to an adjudication that
         complies with" Article III insofar as it empowers civilian arbitrators to determine the
         amount of compensation they are entitled to receive for use of their research data. Amended
         Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Injunction ยถยถ 20-21, App. 23-24. The relief they
         claim against the Environmental Protection Agency and its Administrator (collectively
         referred to as the agency, EPA, or the Administrator) is a declaration of
         unconstitutionality and an injunction against use of their data in the agency's processing
         of applications filed by third parties. See id., at 24.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*603</span> In ยง 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) of the Federal Insecticide,
         Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act,<span class="sup">[1]</span> Congress provided appellees
         with a contingent form of protection against the EPA's use of certain of their research
         data: "[T]he Administrator may, without the permission of the original data submitter,
         consider any such item of data in support of an application by any other person
         (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the `applicant'). . . only if the
         applicant has made an offer to compensate the original data submitter . . . ." 92 Stat.
         821, 7 U. S. C. ยง 136a(c)(1)(D)(ii) (emphasis added). Appellees' research data may not be
         used to process a third party's application unless that party offers to compensate
         appellees in an amount that is "fixed by agreement between the original data submitter and
         the applicant, or, failing such agreement, binding arbitration." Ibid. But if the third
         party consents to this procedure for determining the appropriate compensation, there is no
         statutory restraint on EPA's use of the data.<span class="sup">[2]</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*604</span> Appellees make no claim that the Administrator
         has used any of their data without obtaining the consent required by the statute. Thus, the
         statute provides no basis for any relief against EPA. And if we should declare ยง
         3(c)(1)(D)(ii) unconstitutional, there is no other basis of which I am aware <span
            class="star-pagination">*605</span> for interfering with the agency's use of appellees'
         data. See ante, at 584-585; Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986, 1016-1019 (1984).
         Therefore, whether or not the arbitration provision is constitutional, there is no basis
         for enjoining EPA's use of appellees' research data.</p>
      <p>For a party to have standing to invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court "relief from the
         injury must be `likely' to follow from a favorable decision." Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S.
         737, 751 (1984); accord, Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation
         of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 472 (1982); Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare
         Rights Organization, 426 U. S. 26, 38, 43-46 (1976); Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 507
         (1975); Linda R. S. v. Richard D., 410 U. S. 614, 618-619 (1973). Because ยง 3(c)(1)(D)(ii)
         does not give appellees any legal basis for claiming that they have been harmed by anything
         EPA did or threatened to do, a decision that FIFRA's arbitration provisions violate Article
         III could not support an injunction against the Administrator's use of appellees' data.
         Accordingly, appellees do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of ยง
         3(c)(1)(D)(ii) in this action.<span class="sup">[3]</span> For this reason, I agree that
         the judgment of the District Court must be reversed.</p>

         to data submitted after December 31, 1969, by an applicant or registrant to support an
         application for registration, experimental use permit, or amendment adding a new use to an
         existing registration, to support or maintain in effect an existing registration, or for
         registration, the Administrator may, without the permission of the original data submitter
         consider any such item of data in support of an application by any other person
         (hereinafter in this chapter referred to as the `applicant') within the fifteen year period
         following the date the data were originally submitted only if the applicant has made an
         offer to compensate the original data submitter and submitted such offer to the
         Administrator accompanied by evidence of delivery to the original data submitter of the
         offer. The terms and amount of compensation may be fixed by agreement between the original
         data submitter and the applicant, or, failing such an agreement, binding arbitration under
         this subparagraph. If, at the end of ninety days after the date of delivery to the original
         data submitter of the offer to compensate, the original data submitter and the applicant,
         have neither agreed on the amount and terms of compensation nor on a procedure for reaching
         an agreement on the amount and terms of compensation, either person may initiate binding
         arbitration proceedings by requesting the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to
         appoint an arbitrator from the roster of arbitrators maintained by such Service. The
         procedures and rules of the Service shall be applicable to the selection of such arbitrator
         and to such arbitration proceedings, and the findings and determination of the arbitrator
         shall be final and conclusive, and no official or court of the United States shall have
         power or jurisdiction to review any such findings and determination, except for fraud,
         misrepresentation, or other misconduct by one of the parties to the arbitration or the
         arbitrator where there is a verified complaint with supporting affidavits attesting to
         specific instances of such fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct. The parties to
         the arbitration shall share equally in the payment of the fee and expenses of the
         arbitrator. If the Administrator determines that an original data submitter has failed to
         participate in a procedure for reaching an agreement or in an arbitration proceeding as
         required by this subparagraph, or failed to comply with the terms of an agreement or
         arbitration decision concerning compensation under this subparagraph, the original data
         submitter shall forfeit the right to compensation for the use of the data in support of the
         application. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, if the Administrator
         determines that an applicant has failed to participate in a procedure for reaching an
         agreement or in an arbitration proceeding as required by this subparagraph, or failed to
         comply with the terms of an agreement or arbitration decision concerning compensation under
         this subparagraph, the Administrator shall deny the application or cancel the registration
         of the pesticide in support of which the data were used without further hearing. Before the
         Administrator takes action under either of the proceeding two sentences, the Administrator
         shall furnish to the affected person, by certified mail, notice of intent to take action
         and allow fifteen days from the date of delivery of the notice for the affected person to
         respond. If a registration is denied or canceled under this subparagraph, the Administrator
         may make such order as the Administrator deems appropriate concerning the continued sale
         and use of existing stocks of such pesticide. Registration action by the Administrator
         shall not be delayed pending the fixing of compensation." 7 U. S. C. ยง

      <p>[2] Following the 1978 amendments, appellees amended their complaints to allege that the
         data-consideration and disclosure provisions effected a taking of their property without
         just compensation and without due process of law. The District Court granted a preliminary
         injunction against use of data submitted prior to 1978, Amchem Products, Inc. v. Costle,

         </span> (1979), but the Second Circuit reversed for want of a showing of likelihood of
         success and this Court denied appellees' petition for a writ of certiorari. Union Carbide
         Agricultural Products Co. v. Costle, 632 F. 2d 1014 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U. S. 996
         (1981). Appellees then amended their complaint to allege that the lack of valuation
         standards rendered the arbitration provision an unconstitutional delegation of legislative
         authority in violation of Article I. At the same time they stipulated to dismissal, without
         prejudice to a Court of Claims action, of their due process claims. Record, Doc. Nos. 1,
         15, 19.</p>
      <p>[3] Shortly after the award was handed down, PPG filed an action against Stauffer and EPA
         in the District Court for the District of Columbia to set aside the award. Stauffer
         cross-claimed against EPA seeking to have the entire FIFRA data-compensation scheme
         invalidated as violative of Article III and counterclaimed against PPG seeking damages in
         the amount of the award should the statute be struck down or, in the alternative,
         enforcement of the award. PPG Industries, Inc. v. Stauffer Chemical Co., Civil Action No.
         83-1941 (DC, filed July 7, 1983); Record, Doc. No. 35. Should the scheme be upheld,
         Stauffer argues it is entitled to the award as the only option possible under FIFRA absent
         fraud or misconduct.</p>
      <p>[4] As noted supra, at 585, appellees retain Tucker Act claims in the District Courts or in
         the United States Claims Court with review in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
         for any shortfall between the arbitration award and the value of trade secrets submitted
         between 1972 and 1978.</p>
      <p>[1] In Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S. 438 (1929), public rights disputes were described
         as those "which may be . . . committed exclusively to executive officers." Id., at 458. In
         this regard it is worth noting that early cases recognizing a public rights doctrine
         typically involved either challenges to Government action affecting private interests in
         which at the time no constitutional claim of entitlement was recognized, e. g., United
         States v. Babcock, 250 U. S. 328, 331 (1919); Decatur v. Paulding, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/rBq/decatur-v-paulding/">

               <span class="page">497</span>

         </span> (1840), or challenges by one private party seeking exercise of the Federal
         Government's enforcement authority against another private party not before the court, e.
         g., Ex parte Bakelite Corp., supra. The original theory would seem to have been that
         because Congress had absolute power to dispose of such issues as it saw fit without resort
         to the Judiciary, it could assign decisionmaking authority to Art. I courts. </p>
      <p>The underpinnings of the original theory, of course, have not survived intact. We now
         recognize an entitlement in certain forms of government assistance. Goldberg v. Kelly, 397
         U. S. 254 (1970). And we have recently made clear that government is not free to dispose of
         individual claims of entitlement in any manner it deems fit. Cleveland Board of Education
         v. Loudermill, 470 U. S. 532 (1985). Also, such reasoning is not consistent with the
         doctrine of unconstitutional conditions. See Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513 (1958). The
         erosion of these underpinnings does not, however, mandate the conclusion that disputes
         arising in the administration of federal regulatory programs may not be resolved through
         Art. I adjudication. The term "public rights" as now understood encompasses those "matters
         arising between the Government and persons subject to its authority in connection with the
         performance of the constitutional functions of the executive or legislative departments,"
         Northern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 67-68, that need not be fully adjudicated in an Art. III
         forum or a properly constituted adjunct to such a forum.</p>
      <p>[2] "What clearly remains subject to Art. III are all private adjudications in federal
         courts within the States &#x97; matters from their nature subject to a `suit at common law
         or in equity or admiralty.' . . . There is no doubt that when the Framers assigned the
         `judicial Power' to an independent Art. III Branch, these matters lay at what they
         perceived to be the protected core of that power." Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v.
         Marathon Pipe Line Co., supra, at 70-71, n. 25.</p>
      <p>[3] As the Court correctly concludes, there is no tenable argument that appellees in this
         case will be forced to undergo an Art. I adjudication of a state-law claim that arises
         between private parties, as was the case in Northern Pipeline. See ante, at 584-585.</p>
      <p>[4] Although the essential function of the Judiciary is to "say what the law is," Marbury
         v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803), the exercise of this power with respect to the
         interpretation of federal statutory law may not be the power that constrains the actions of
         the Legislative Branch. Congress is always free to reject this Court's interpretation of a
         federal statute by passing a new law. It may rather be that the exercise of the Court's
         power of judicial review to ensure constitutionality is what restrains the exercise of
         legislative power. The power to interpret federal statutory law could be seen as acting as
         a check on the exercise of the executive power &#x97; or the power of administrative
         agencies whether or not they are considered as under the head of executive authority &#x97;
         given that what courts do when they review agency action, both rulemaking and adjudication,
         is ensure that the reviewed action has not departed from congressional intent.</p>
      <p>[5] It is also important to note that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment
         imposes, as the Court correctly notes, independent constraints on the ability of Congress
         to establish particular forums for dispute resolution under Art. I. See ante, at 592. Cf.
         Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S., at 87 (Brandeis, J., dissenting).</p>
      <p>[1] The text of ยง 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) is quoted in full ante, at 574-575, n. 1.</p>
      <p>[2] Under appellees' reading of ยง 3(c)(1)(D)(ii), compensation is a condition precedent to
         EPA's use of their research data to evaluate applications by third parties. See Amended
         Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Injunction ยถ 20, App. 23. Because the statutorily
         required arbitration procedure violates Article III, they reason, compensation cannot be
         awarded and the condition precedent to EPA's use of data cannot be fulfilled. Ergo, an
         injunction must issue against the agency. </p>
      <p>Appellees, however, misread the statute. Section 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) conditions the
         Administrator's use of their data on a third party's "offer to compensate," not upon actual
         compensation. 92 Stat. 821, 7 U. S. C. ยง 136a(c)(1)(D)(ii) (emphasis added); accord, ยง
         3(c)(1)(D)(iii), 92 Stat. 822, 7 U. S. C. ยง 136a(c)(1)(D)(iii). Indeed, the same section
         later provides that "[r]egistration action by the Administrator shall not be delayed
         pending the fixing of compensation." 92 Stat. 822, 7 U. S. C. ยง 136a(c)(1)(D)(ii). A
         straightforward reading of this section demonstrates that EPA is not disabled from using
         research data to process "follow-on" registrations pending compensation of appellees. I
         find nothing in the legislative history that contradicts this interpretation, and it is
         consistent with Congress' "vie[w] [of] data-sharing as essential to the registration
         scheme," ante, at 573, and with the Legislature's consequent desire to break "the `logjam
         of litigation that resulted from controversies over data compensation and trade secret
         protection,' " ibid. (quoting S. Rep. No. 95-334, p. 3 (1977)). See id., at 3 ("The single
         largest problem is the fact that the registration and reregistration process has ground to
         a virtual halt. . . . Since registration is critical, this program must be made to work").
         Congress surely desired both that EPA have use of appellees' data and that appellees be
         compensated for such use. But there is no evidence to indicate that Congress intended these
         complementary provisions to be mutually dependent. See ยง 30, 92 Stat. 836, 7 U. S. C. ยง
         136x ("If any provision of this [Act] . . . is held invalid, the invalidity shall not
         affect other provisions . . . which can be given effect without regard to the invalid
         provision . . . and to this end the provisions of this [Act] are severable"); cf. INS v.
         Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 931-935 (1983).</p>
      <p>The sentence the Court believes "ties the follow-on registration to the arbitration," ante,
         at 582, is beside the point. Section 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) requires the Administrator to "deny the
         application or cancel the registration of the pesticide" if the third-party "follow-on"
         applicant "has failed to participate in a procedure for reaching an agreement or in an
         arbitration proceeding as required by this subparagraph, or failed to comply with the terms
         of an agreement or arbitration decision concerning compensation." 92 Stat. 821, 7 U. S. C.
         ยง 136a(c)(1)(D)(ii). This sentence is obviously addressed to defaults by third-party
         "follow-on" applicants in the registration process and hardly suggests that Congress would
         have scrapped the entire data-use provision if the compensation component was found
         unconstitutional. To restate the obvious, Congress undoubtedly intended that EPA have use
         of original applicants' research data and that such use be recompensed &#x97; the statute,
         after all, provides for both. But the Legislature's unequivocal intention to facilitate
         pesticide registrations and the presence of an express severability provision (accompanied
         by the traditional duty "to save and not to destroy," Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672,
         684 (1971)), makes it rather unlikely that Congress gambled the entire pesticide
         registration process on the constitutionality of a provision for arbitrable compensation. I
         therefore conclude that even if we invalidated the compensation clauses appellees would
         have no right to an injunction against EPA's use of appellees' research data.</p>

         </span>, 123, n. 2 (SDNY 1983). This analysis is incomplete: "The injury must be `fairly'
         traceable to the challenged action, and relief from the injury must be `likely' to follow
         from a favorable decision." Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S., at 751 (emphasis added); accord,
         Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State,
         Inc., 454 U. S., at 472. These two components of the Article III causation requirement are
         distinct: The "fairly traceable" component "examines the causal connection between the
         assertedly unlawful conduct and the alleged injury"; the "redressability" component
         "examines the causal connection between the alleged injury and the judicial relief
         requested." Allen v. Wright, supra, at 753, n. 19. "[I]t is important to keep the inquiries
         separate." Ibid.</p>
