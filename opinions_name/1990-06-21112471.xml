      </p>
      <p>CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
      <p>The question presented in this case is whether the application of a Texas statute, which
         was passed after respondent's crime and which allowed the reformation of an improper jury
         verdict in respondent's case, violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of Art. I, § 10. We hold
         that it does not.</p>
      <p>Respondent Carroll Youngblood was convicted in a Texas court of aggravated sexual abuse.
         The jury imposed punishment of life imprisonment and a fine of $10,000. After his
         conviction and sentence were affirmed by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, Youngblood
         applied for a writ of habeas corpus in the State District Court. He argued that the Texas
         Code of Criminal Procedure did not authorize a fine in addition to a term of imprisonment
         for his offense, and, thus, under the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals in Bogany
         v. State, 661 S. W. 2d 957 (1983), the judgment and sentence were void, and he was entitled
         to a new trial.<span class="sup">[1]</span> In April 1985, the District Court, feeling
         bound by Bogany, recommended that the writ be granted.</p>
      <p>Before the habeas application was considered by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which
         has the exclusive power under Texas law to grant writs of habeas corpus, see Tex. Code
         Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 11.07 (Vernon 1977 and Supp. 1990), a new Texas statute designed to
         modify the Bogany <span class="star-pagination">*40</span> decision became effective.
         Article 37.10(b), as of June 11, 1985, allows an appellate court to reform an improper
         verdict that assesses a punishment not authorized by law. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art.
         37.10(b) (Vernon Supp. 1990); see Ex parte Johnson, 697 S. W. 2d 605 (Tex. Crim. App.
         1985). Relying on that statute, the Court of Criminal Appeals reformed the verdict in
         Youngblood's case by ordering deletion of the $10,000 fine and denied his request for a new
         trial.</p>
      <p>Youngblood then sought a writ of habeas corpus from the United States District Court for
         the Eastern District of Texas, arguing that the retroactive application of Art. 37.10(b)
         violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of Art. I, § 10, of the Federal Constitution. The
         District Court concluded that since Youngblood's "punishment ... was not increased (but
         actually decreased), and the elements of the offense or the ultimate facts necessary to
         establish guilt were not changed," there was no ex post facto violation. App. to Pet. for
         Cert. C-6.</p>
      <p>The Court of Appeals reversed. Youngblood v. Lynaugh, 882 F. 2d 956 (CA5 1989). It relied
         on the statement in this Court's decision in Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343 (1898), that
         retroactive procedural statutes violate the Ex Post Facto Clause unless they "`leave
         untouched all the substantial protections with which existing law surrounds the person
         accused of crime,'" Lynaugh, supra, at 959 (quoting 170 U. S., at 352). It held that
         Youngblood's right to a new trial under the Bogany decision was such a "substantial
         protection," and therefore ordered that a writ of habeas corpus be issued. We granted
         certiorari. 493 U. S. 1001 (1989).</p>
      <p>Because respondent is before us on collateral review, we are faced with a threshold
         question whether the relief sought by Youngblood would constitute a "new rule," which would
         not apply retroactively under our decisions in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), and
         Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407 (1990). Generally speaking, "[r]etroactivity is <span
            class="star-pagination">*41</span> properly treated as a threshold question, for, once a
         new rule is applied to the defendant in the case announcing the rule, evenhanded justice
         requires that it be applied retroactively to all who are similarly situated." Teague,
         supra, at 300. The State of Texas, however, did not address retroactivity in its petition
         for certiorari or its briefs on the merits, and when asked about the issue at oral
         argument, counsel answered that the State had chosen not to rely on Teague. Tr. of Oral
         Arg. 4-5. Although the Teague rule is grounded in important considerations of federal-state
         relations, we think it is not "jurisdictional" in the sense that this Court, despite a
         limited grant of certiorari, must raise and decide the issue sua sponte. Cf. Patsy v. Board
         of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S. 496, 515, n. 19 (1982) (Eleventh Amendment defense need not
         be raised and decided by the Court on its own motion). We granted certiorari to consider
         the merits of respondent's ex post facto claim, and we proceed to do so.</p>
      <p>Although the Latin phrase "ex post facto" literally encompasses any law passed "after the
         fact," it has long been recognized by this Court that the constitutional prohibition on ex
         post facto laws applies only to penal statutes which disadvantage the offender affected by
         them. Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390-392 (1798) (opinion of Chase, J.); id., at 396
         (opinion of Paterson, J.); id., at 400 (opinion of Iredell, J.). See Miller v. Florida, 482
         U. S. 423, 430 (1987).<span class="sup">[2]</span> As early opinions in this Court
         explained, "ex post facto law" was a term of art with an established meaning at the time of
         the framing of the Constitution. Calder, 3 Dall., at 391 (opinion of Chase, J.); id., at
         396 (opinion of Paterson, J.). Justice Chase's now familiar opinion in Calder expounded
         those legislative <span class="star-pagination">*42</span> Acts which in his view
         implicated the core concern of the Ex Post Facto Clause:</p> "1st. Every law that makes an
      action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and
      punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was,
      when committed. 3d. Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment,
      than the law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th. Every law that alters the legal rules
      of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of
      the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender." Id., at 390 (emphasis in
      original). <p>Early opinions of the Court portrayed this as an exclusive definition of ex post
         facto laws. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 138 (1810); Cummings v. Missouri, <span
            class="citation">

            </a>
         </span>, 325-326 (1867); id., at 391 (Miller, J., dissenting) ("This exposition of the
         nature of ex post facto laws has never been denied, nor has any court or any commentator on
         the Constitution added to the classes of laws here set forth, as coming within that
         clause"); Gut v. State, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/scv/gut-v-state/">

            </a>
         </span>, 38 (1870). So well accepted were these principles that the Court in Beazell v.
         Ohio, 269 U. S. 167 (1925), was able to confidently summarize the meaning of the Clause as
         follows:</p> "It is settled, by decisions of this Court so well known that their citation
      may be dispensed with, that any statute which punishes as a crime an act previously committed,
      which was innocent when done; which makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after
      its commission, or which deprives one charged with crime of any defense available according to
      law at the time when the act was committed, is prohibited as ex post facto." Id., at 169-170. <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*43</span> See also Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282, 292
            (1977).<span class="sup">[3]</span>
      </p>
      <p>The Beazell formulation is faithful to our best knowledge of the original understanding of
         the Ex Post Facto Clause: Legislatures may not retroactively alter the definition of crimes
         or increase the punishment for criminal acts. Several early State Constitutions employed
         this definition of the term, and they appear to have been a basis for the Framers'
         understanding of the provision. See The Federalist No. 44, p. 301 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J.
         Madison); 2 M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 376 (1911); Calder, 3
         Dall., at 391-392 (opinion of Chase, J.); id., at 396-397 (opinion of Paterson, J.). The
         Constitutions of Maryland and North Carolina, for example, declared that "retrospective
         laws, punishing facts committed before the existence of such laws, and by them only
         declared criminal, are oppressive, unjust, and incompatible with liberty; wherefore no ex
         post facto law ought to be made." See Constitution of Maryland, Declaration of Rights, Art.
         XV (1776); Constitution of North Carolina, Declaration of Rights, Art. XXIV (1776). Other
         State Constitutions, though not using the phrase "ex post facto," included similar
         articles. See Declaration of Rights and Fundamental Rules of the Delaware State § 11
         (1776); Constitution or Form of Government for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
         Declaration of Rights, Art. XXIV (1780).</p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*44</span> Another historical reference, Blackstone's
         Commentaries, which was discussed by the Framers during debates on the Ex Post Facto
         Clause, see 2 M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 448-449 (1911),
         and deemed an authoritative source of the technical meaning of the term in Calder, see 3
         Dall., at 391 (opinion of Chase, J.); id., at 396 (opinion of Paterson, J.), buttresses
         this understanding. According to Blackstone, a law is ex post facto "when after an action
         (indifferent in itself) is committed, the legislator then for the first time declares it to
         have been a crime, and inflicts a punishment upon the person who has committed it." 1 W.
         Blackstone, Commentaries * 46. Although increased punishments are not mentioned explicitly
         in the historical sources, the Court has never questioned their prohibition, apparently on
         the theory that "[t]he enhancement of a crime, or penalty, seems to come within the same
         mischief as the creation of a crime or penalty." Calder, supra, at 397 (opinion of
         Paterson, J.). The Beazell definition, then, is faithful to the use of the term "ex post
         facto law" at the time the Constitution was adopted.</p>
      <p>Respondent concedes that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.10(b) (Vernon Supp. 1990),
         does not fall within any of the Beazell categories and, under that definition, would not
         constitute an ex post facto law as applied to him. The new statute is a procedural change
         that allows reformation of improper verdicts. It does not alter the definition of the crime
         of aggravated sexual abuse, of which Youngblood was convicted, nor does it increase the
         punishment for which he is eligible as a result of that conviction. Nevertheless,
         respondent maintains that this Court's decisions have not limited the scope of the Ex Post
         Facto Clause to the finite Beazell categories, but have stated more broadly that
         retroactive legislation contravenes Art. I, § 10, if it deprives an accused of a
         "substantial protection" under law existing at the time of the crime. He argues that the
         new trial guaranteed him by former Texas law is such a protection.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*45</span> Several of our cases have described as
         "procedural" those changes which, even though they work to the disadvantage of the accused,
         do not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Dobbert v. Florida, supra, at 292-293, and n. 6;
         Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S., at 171; Mallett v. North Carolina, 181 U. S. 589, 597 (1901).
         While these cases do not explicitly define what they mean by the word "procedural," it is
         logical to think that the term refers to changes in the procedures by which a criminal case
         is adjudicated, as opposed to changes in the substantive law of crimes. Respondent
         correctly notes, however, that we have said that a procedural change may constitute an ex
         post facto violation if it "affect[s] matters of substance," Beazell, supra, at 171, by
         depriving a defendant of "substantial protections with which the existing law surrounds the
         person accused of crime," Duncan v. Missouri, 152 U. S. 377, 382-383 (1894), or arbitrarily
         infringing upon "substantial personal rights." Malloy v. South Carolina, 237 U. S. 180, 183
         (1915); Beazell, supra, at 171.</p>
      <p>We think this language from the cases cited has imported confusion into the interpretation
         of the Ex Post Facto Clause. The origin of the rather amorphous phrase, "substantial
         protections," appears to lie in a 19th-century treatise on constitutional law by Professor
         Thomas Cooley. T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations * 272. According to Cooley, who
         notably assumed the Calder construction of the Ex Post Facto Clause to be correct,
         Constitutional Limitations * 265, a legislature "may prescribe altogether different modes
         of procedure in its discretion, though it cannot lawfully, we think, in so doing, dispense
         with any of those substantial protections with which the existing law surrounds the person
         accused of crime." Id., at *272.</p>
      <p>This Court's decision in Duncan v. Missouri, supra, subsequently adopted that
         phraseology:</p> "[A]n ex post facto law is one which imposes a punishment for an act which
      was not punishable at the time it was committed; or an additional punishment to that then
         <span class="star-pagination">*46</span> prescribed; or changes the rules of evidence by
      which less or different testimony is sufficient to convict than was then required; or, in
      short, in relation to the offence or its consequences, alters the situation of a party to his
      disadvantage; but the prescribing of different modes or procedure and the abolition of courts
      and creation of new ones, leaving untouched all the substantial protections with which the
      existing law surrounds the person accused of crime, are not considered within the
      constitutional inhibition. Cooley Const. Lim. (5th ed.) 329." Id., at 382-383 (other citations
      omitted) (emphasis added). <p>Later, in Malloy v. South Carolina, supra, we stated that even
         with regard to procedural changes, the Ex Post Facto Clause was "intended to secure
         substantial personal rights against arbitrary and oppressive legislative action." Id., at
         183. We repeated that recognition in Beazell itself, while also emphasizing that the
         provision was "not to limit the legislative control of remedies and modes of procedure
         which do not affect matters of substance." Beazell, supra, at 171.</p>
      <p>We think the best way to make sense out of this discussion in the cases is to say that by
         simply labeling a law "procedural," a legislature does not thereby immunize it from
         scrutiny under the Ex Post Facto Clause. See Gibson v. Mississippi, 162 U. S. 565, 590
         (1896). Subtle ex post facto violations are no more permissible than overt ones. In
         Beazell, supra, we said that the constitutional prohibition is addressed to laws, "whatever
         their form," which make innocent acts criminal, alter the nature of the offense, or
         increase the punishment. Id., at 170. But the prohibition which may not be evaded is the
         one defined by the Calder categories. See Duncan, supra, at 382; Malloy, supra, at 183-184.
         The references in Duncan and Malloy to "substantial protections" and "personal rights"
         should not be read to adopt without explanation an undefined enlargement of the Ex Post
         Facto Clause.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*47</span> Two decisions of this Court, relied upon by
         respondent, do not fit into this analytical framework. In Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S. 221
         (1883), the Court said "it is not to be supposed that the opinion in [Calder v. Bull]
         undertook to define, by way of exclusion, all the cases to which the constitutional
         provision would be applicable." Id., at 228. It defined an ex post facto law, inter alia,
         as one which, "`in relation to the offence or its consequences, alters the situation of a
         party to his disadvantage.'" Id., at 228-229 (quoting United States v. Hall, <span
            class="citation">
            <a href="/mont/5vP3/state-v-hall/">

               <span class="page">84</span>
            </a>
         </span>, 86 (No. 15,285) (D Pa. 1809)) (emphasis deleted). And in Thompson v. Utah, 170 U.
         S. 343 (1898), the Court held that a change in Utah law reducing the size of juries in
         criminal cases from 12 persons to 8 deprived Thompson of "a substantial right involved in
         his liberty" and violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. Id., at 352.</p>
      <p>Neither of these decisions, in our view, is consistent with the understanding of the term
         "ex post facto law" at the time the Constitution was adopted. Nor has their reasoning been
         followed by this Court since Thompson was decided in 1898. These cases have caused
         confusion in state and lower federal courts about the scope of the Ex Post Facto Clause, as
         exemplified by the opinions of the District Court and Court of Appeals in this case. See
         also Murphy v. Kentucky, 465 U. S. 1072, 1073 (1984) (WHITE, J., dissenting from denial of
         certiorari) (noting "the evident confusion among lower courts concerning the application of
         the Ex Post Facto Clause to changes in rules of evidence and procedure"); United States v.

         Constitutional Law 638 (2d ed. 1988) (procedural changes upheld by the Court "can hardly be
         distinguished in any functional way from those invalidated").</p>
      <p>The earlier decision, Kring v. Missouri, was a capital case with a lengthy procedural
         history. Kring was charged with first-degree murder, but pursuant to a plea agreement, he
            <span class="star-pagination">*48</span> pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. The
         plea was accepted by the prosecutor and the trial court, and he was sentenced to 25 years
         in prison. He appealed the judgment, however, on the ground that his plea agreement
         provided for a sentence of no more than 10 years. The State Supreme Court reversed the
         judgment and remanded for further proceedings. In the trial court, Kring refused to
         withdraw his guilty plea to second-degree murder and refused to renew his plea of not
         guilty to first-degree murder, insisting instead that the acceptance of his earlier plea
         constituted an acquittal on the greater charge. The trial court, over Kring's objection,
         directed a general plea of not guilty to be entered, and upon retrial, he was convicted of
         first-degree murder and sentenced to death.</p>
      <p>At the time the crime was committed, Missouri law provided that a defendant's plea of
         guilty to second-degree murder, if accepted by the prosecutor and the court, served as an
         acquittal of the charge of first-degree murder. After the crime, but before Kring made his
         plea, a new Missouri Constitution abrogated that rule. The State was thus free, as a matter
         of Missouri law, to retry Kring for first-degree murder after his conviction and the
         25-year sentence for second-degree murder were vacated. The Supreme Court of Missouri held
         that the new law did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, because it effected only a
         change in criminal procedure.</p>
      <p>This Court reversed by a vote of 5 to 4. As support for the view that Calder did not define
         an exclusive list of legislative Acts falling within the constitutional prohibition,
         Justice Miller's opinion for the Court quoted a jury charge given by Justice Washington
         sitting in the District Court: "`[A]n ex post facto law is one which, in its operation,
         makes that criminal which was not so at the time the action was performed; or which
         increases the punishment, or, in short, which, in relation to the offence or its
         consequences, alters the situation of a party to his disadvantage.'" Kring, supra, at
         228-229 <span class="star-pagination">*49</span> (quoting United States v. Hall, supra, at
         86) (emphasis in original). Applying that test, the Court concluded that because the new
         Missouri Constitution denied Kring the benefit of an implied acquittal which the previous
         law provided, it "altered the situation to his disadvantage," and his conviction for
         first-degree murder was void. Kring, supra, at 235-236.</p>
      <p>The Court's departure from Calder's explanation of the original understanding of the Ex
         Post Facto Clause was, we think, unjustified. The language in the Hall case, heavily relied
         upon in Kring and repeated in other decisions thereafter, does not support a more expansive
         definition of ex post facto laws.</p>
      <p>In Hall, a vessel owner was sued by the United States for forfeiture of an embargo bond
         obliging him to deliver certain cargo to Portland, Me. As a legal excuse, the defendant
         argued that a severe storm had disabled his vessel and forced him to land in Puerto Rico,
         where he was forced by the Puerto Rican government to sell the cargo. In dicta, Justice
         Washington hypothesized that, according to the law in effect at the time Hall forfeited the
         cargo, an "unavoidable accident" was an affirmative defense to a charge of failing to
         deliver cargo. His jury instruction then explained that a subsequent law imposing an
         additional requirement for the affirmative defense &#x97; that the vessel or cargo actually
         be lost at sea as a result of the unavoidable accident &#x97; would deprive Hall of a
         defense of his actions available at the time he sold the cargo and thus be an invalid ex
         post facto law.</p>
      <p>This analysis is consistent with the Beazell framework. A law that abolishes an affirmative
         defense of justification or excuse contravenes Art. I, § 10, because it expands the scope
         of a criminal prohibition after the act is done. It appears, therefore, that Justice
         Washington's reference to laws "relat[ing] to the offence or its consequences," was simply
         shorthand for legal changes altering the definition of an offense or increasing a
         punishment. His jury charge should not be read to mean that the Constitution prohibits
         retrospective <span class="star-pagination">*50</span> laws, other than those encompassed
         by the Calder categories, which "alte[r] the situation of a party to his disadvantage."
         Nothing in the Hall case supports the broad construction of the ex post facto provision
         given by the Court in Kring.</p>
      <p>It is possible to reconcile Kring with the numerous cases which have held that "procedural"
         changes do not result in ex post facto violations by saying that the change in Missouri law
         did take away a "defense" available to the defendant under the old procedure. But this use
         of the word "defense" carries a meaning quite different from that which appears in the
         quoted language from Beazell, where the term was linked to the prohibition on alterations
         in "the legal definition of the offense" or "the nature or amount of the punishment imposed
         for its commission." Beazell, 269 U. S., at 169-170. The "defense" available to Kring under
         earlier Missouri law was not one related to the definition of the crime, but was based on
         the law regulating the effect of guilty pleas. Missouri had not changed any of the elements
         of the crime of murder, or the matters which might be pleaded as an excuse or justification
         for the conduct underlying such a charge; it had changed its law respecting the effect of a
         guilty plea to a lesser included offense. The holding in Kring can only be justified if the
         Ex Post Facto Clause is thought to include not merely the Calder categories, but any change
         which "alters the situation of a party to his disadvantage." We think such a reading of the
         Clause departs from the meaning of the Clause as it was understood at the time of the
         adoption of the Constitution, and is not supported by later cases. We accordingly overrule
         Kring.</p>
      <p>The second case, Thompson v. Utah, must be viewed in historical context. Thompson was
         initially charged with his crime &#x97; grand larceny committed by stealing a calf &#x97;
         in 1895, when Utah was a Territory. He was tried by a jury of 12 persons and convicted. A
         new trial was subsequently granted, however, and in the meantime Utah was admitted <span
            class="star-pagination">*51</span> into the Union as a State. The Constitution of the
         State of Utah provided that juries in noncapital cases would consist of 8 persons, not 12,
         and Thompson was retried and convicted by a panel of 8.</p>
      <p>This Court reversed the conviction. It reasoned first that while Utah was a Territory, the
         Sixth Amendment applied to actions of the territorial government and guaranteed Thompson a
         right to a 12-person jury. 170 U. S., at 349-350. The Court then held that "the State did
         not acquire upon its admission into the Union the power to provide, in respect of felonies
         committed within its limits while it was a Territory, that they should be tried otherwise
         than by a jury such as is provided by the Constitution of the United States." Id., at
         350-351. Because the State Constitution "deprive[d] him of a substantial right involved in
         his liberty" and "materially alter[ed] the situation to his disadvantage," the Court
         concluded that Thompson's conviction was prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause. Id., at
         352-353.</p>
      <p>The result in Thompson v. Utah foreshadowed our decision in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S.
         145 (1968), which held that the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury &#x97; then believed
         to mean a jury of 12, see, e. g., Patton v. United States, 281 U. S. 276, 288-289 (1930)
         &#x97; was incorporated and made applicable by the Fourteenth Amendment against the States.
         The Court held that since Utah was a Territory when Thompson's crime was committed, and
         therefore obligated to provide a 12-person jury by the Sixth Amendment, the Ex Post Facto
         Clause prevented the State from taking away that substantial right from him when it became
         a State and was no longer bound by the Sixth Amendment as then interpreted. The right to
         jury trial provided by the Sixth Amendment is obviously a "substantial" one, but it is not
         a right that has anything to do with the definition of crimes, defenses, or punishments,
         which is the concern of the Ex Post Facto Clause. To the extent that Thompson v. Utah <span
            class="star-pagination">*52</span> rested on the Ex Post Facto Clause and not the Sixth
         Amendment, we overrule it.<span class="sup">[4]</span>
      </p>
      <p>The Texas statute allowing reformation of improper verdicts does not punish as a crime an
         act previously committed, which was innocent when done; nor make more burdensome the
         punishment for a crime, after its commission; nor deprive one charged with crime of any
         defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed. Its application
         to respondent therefore is not prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause of Art. I, § 10.</p>
      <p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>
      <p>Reversed.</p></div>
      <p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE MARSHALL join, concurring in the
         judgment.</p>
      <p>The "Ex Post Facto" Clause of the Constitution<span class="sup">[1]</span> has been
         construed to embrace any law that deprives a person accused of crime of a "substantial
         protection" that the law afforded at the time of the alleged offense. Thus, the Clause
         prohibits not only the retroactive creation of new criminal offenses and more harsh
         penalties, but also substantial changes in procedure that are designed to protect the
         defendant from a wrongful conviction. The question in this case is whether a law that
         changed a postconviction remedy for an erroneous sentence &#x97; by conforming it to the
         law in effect at the time of the offense instead of affording the defendant a new trial on
         all issues &#x97; effected a "substantial" deprivation within the meaning of our cases. I
         agree with the Court's conclusion <span class="star-pagination">*53</span> that the new law
         did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, but I believe that conclusion is entirely
         consistent with our precedents.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>I</h2>
      <p>Respondent committed a crime that was punishable by a maximum sentence of life imprisonment
         and was convicted on March 17, 1982. Under Texas law, it was the jury's task to impose
         sentence as well as to determine guilt or innocence. By consequence of a faulty
         instruction, respondent was improperly sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of
         $10,000. The following year, in Bogany v. State, 661 S. W. 2d 957 (1983), the Texas Court
         of Criminal Appeals held in a somewhat similar case that the fine was not authorized by
         law, and that no reviewing court had authority to correct such an erroneous sentence.
         Instead, the entire judgment was deemed "void" and the defendant was entitled to a new
            trial.<span class="sup">[2]</span> Understandably, the Texas Legislature recognized that
         corrective legislation was in order, for it is difficult to understand why an error in
         sentencing should necessitate a second trial on the issue of guilt or innocence.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*54</span> Theoretically, the legislature might have remedied
         the situation in either of two ways. It might have authorized a punishment of both life
         imprisonment and a $10,000 fine for respondent's offense or, alternatively, it might have
         authorized a court to correct the sentence by eliminating the fine. The former option would
         plainly have violated the Ex Post Facto Clause because it would have increased respondent's
         punishment beyond the penalty authorized at the time of his offense. The second option,
         which the Texas Legislature adopted, is not subject to that defect; nor does it criminalize
         previously innocent conduct or make any change in the procedures used to convict or to
         sentence respondent. It created a new remedy designed to conform respondent's sentence to
         that authorized by law at the time of his offense. Such legislation does not violate the Ex
         Post Facto Clause.</p>
      <p>The argument to the contrary is based on our cases holding that the Clause applies to
         procedural, as well as substantive, changes that deprive a defendant of "substantial
         personal rights" and a claim that respondent's right to a new trial after an erroneous
         sentence was such a right. The argument misreads our precedents and overlooks the critical
         importance of evaluating the procedural right at issue by reference to the time of the
         offense.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>II</h2>
      <p>In Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S. 221 (1883), the Court rejected the argument that the Ex
         Post Facto Clause has no application to procedural changes. At the time of Kring's offense,
         Missouri law provided that the acceptance of a plea of guilty to second-degree murder
         constituted an acquittal of first-degree murder. A subsequent amendment to the Missouri
         Constitution abrogated that rule and Kring was thereafter convicted of first-degree murder
         and sentenced to death. The Missouri Supreme Court held that there was no violation of the
         Ex Post Facto Clause because the retroactive <span class="star-pagination">*55</span>
         amendment was merely a procedural change.<span class="sup">[3]</span> This Court's reversal
         of that holding demonstrates that the Clause applies to some procedural changes, but our
         decision rested on the fact that the change had deprived the defendant of a complete
         defense to the charge of first-degree murder and to the imposition of the death penalty. We
         wrote:</p> "Whatever may be the essential nature of the change, it is one which, to the
      defendant, involves the difference between life and death, and the retroactive character of
      the change cannot be denied." Id., at 224. "In the case before us the Constitution of Missouri
      so changes the rule of evidence, that what was conclusive evidence of innocence of the higher
      grade of murder when the crime was committed, namely, a judicial conviction for a lower grade
      of homicide, is not received as evidence at all, or, if received, is given no weight in behalf
      of the offender. It also changes the punishment, for, whereas the law as it stood when the
      homicide was committed was that, when convicted of murder in the second degree, he could never
      be tried or punished by death for murder in the first degree, the new law enacts <span
         class="star-pagination">*56</span> that he may be so punished, notwithstanding the former
      conviction." Id., at 228. <p>Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343 (1898), involved an offense
         committed while Utah was a Territory, but the case was tried after Utah became a State. At
         the time of the offense, the defendant was entitled to a trial by a 12-person jury, but
         under the new State's law only 8 jurors were required. We held that this retrospective
         procedural change deprived Thompson of "a substantial right belonging to him when the
         offense was committed," and therefore violated the Ex Post Facto Clause.</p> "We are of
      opinion that the State did not acquire upon its admission into the Union the power to provide,
      in respect of felonies committed within its limits while it was a Territory, that they should
      be tried otherwise than by a jury such as is provided by the Constitution of the United
      States. When Thompson's crime was committed, it was his constitutional right to demand that
      his liberty should not be taken from him except by the joint action of the court and the
      unanimous verdict of a jury of twelve persons. To hold that a State could deprive him of his
      liberty by the concurrent action of a court and eight jurors, would recognize the power of the
      State not only to do what the United States in respect of Thompson's crime could not, at any
      time, have done by legislation, but to take from the accused a substantial right belonging to
      him when the offence was committed. "It is not necessary to review the numerous cases in which
      the courts have determined whether particular statutes come within the constitutional
      prohibition of ex post facto laws. It is sufficient now to say that a statute belongs to that
      class which by its necessary operation and `in its relation to the offence, or its
      consequences, alters the situation of the accused to his disadvantage.' United States v. Hall,
      2 Wash. C. C. 366; Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S. 221, 228; Medley, Petitioner, 134 U. S. <span
         class="star-pagination">*57</span> 160, 171. Of course, a statute is not of that class
      unless it materially impairs the right of the accused to have the question of his guilt
      determined according to the law as it was when the offence was committed." Id., at 350-351.
         <p>In Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167 (1925), we made it clear that the question whether a
         particular procedural change has a sufficiently drastic impact on a defendant to be
         characterized as "substantial" is a matter of degree. In that case we held that the rule
         applied in Kring and Thompson did not preclude the retrospective application of a rule
         allowing two codefendants to be tried jointly for a noncapital offense. We summarized our
         earlier cases construing the Ex Post Facto Clause and explained:</p> "The constitutional
      prohibition and the judicial interpretation of it rest upon the notion that laws, whatever
      their form, which purport to make innocent acts criminal after the event, or to aggravate an
      offense, are harsh and oppressive, and that the criminal quality attributable to an act,
      either by the legal definition of the offense or by the nature or amount of the punishment
      imposed for its commission, should not be altered by legislative enactment, after the fact, to
      the disadvantage of the accused." 269 U. S., at 170. "And there may be procedural changes
      which operate to deny to the accused a defense available under the laws in force at the time
      of the commission of his offense, or which otherwise affect him in such a harsh and arbitrary
      manner as to fall within the constitutional prohibition. Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S. 221;
      Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343. But it is now well settled that statutory changes in the mode
      of trial or the rules of evidence, which do not deprive the accused of a defense and which
      operate only in a limited and unsubstantial manner to his disadvantage, are not prohibited."
      Ibid. <span class="star-pagination">*58</span> "Just what alterations of procedure will be
      held to be of sufficient moment to transgress the constitutional prohibition cannot be
      embraced within a formula or stated in a general proposition. The distinction is one of
      degree. But the constitutional provision was intended to secure substantial personal rights
      against arbitrary and oppressive legislation, see Malloy v. South Carolina, 237 U. S. 180,
      183, and not to limit the legislative control of remedies and modes of procedure which do not
      affect matters of substance." Id., at 171. <p/>
      <h2>III</h2>
      <p>The foregoing cases make it clear that the mere fact that this case involves a procedural
         change in Texas law is not sufficient to exclude it from the coverage of the Ex Post Facto
         Clause. But it is equally clear that our analysis should focus on the impact of the change
         upon the "right belonging to [the defendant] when the offense was committed." Thompson, 170
         U. S., at 351. In this case, neither the defendant's right to a fair trial nor his right to
         be protected against unauthorized or excessive punishment has been impaired in the
         slightest by the new Texas rule.</p>
      <p>This conclusion follows immediately from an observation which is both sensible and evident
         from precedent: A procedural protection is likely to be substantial, when viewed from the
         time of the commission of the offense, only if it affects the modes of procedure by which a
         valid conviction or sentence may be imposed. The claims in Kring and Thompson both satisfy
         this threshold test. In Kring, the procedural change&#x97;which deprived Kring of a defense
         based upon an earlier trial or plea&#x97;made it easier for the State to obtain a
         first-degree murder charge against a defendant who had never been subject to any valid
         conviction for the crime in question, much less a valid conviction for first-degree murder.
         In Thompson, the reduction in the size of the jury made it easier for the State to obtain a
         unanimous verdict <span class="star-pagination">*59</span> against a defendant who, before
         the verdict, likewise had not been convicted.</p>
      <p>Mallett v. North Carolina, 181 U. S. 589 (1901), is, however, distinguishable from Kring
         and Thompson because it fails to meet the threshold test. In Mallett, a valid conviction
         had been obtained against the defendant. Under the defendant's theory in that case,
         however, the State would have been prohibited from relying upon this conviction because it
         had been vacated by an intermediate appellate court. Although the North Carolina Supreme
         Court reinstated the conviction, Mallett claimed that it lacked power to do so. At the time
         Mallett committed his crime, the State was prohibited by state law from appealing the
         adverse decisions of intermediate appellate courts in criminal cases. This restriction had
         been removed, but Mallett contended that the State had thereby enacted an ex post facto
         law. As the case came to this Court, it was conceded that Mallett was convicted after a
         trial which afforded him all the procedural and substantive protections guaranteed by North
         Carolina law at the time he committed his offense. Nevertheless, according to Mallett's
         theory, the State was prohibited from relying upon his conviction because of the
         combination of an intervening &#x97; and, for this Court's purposes, erroneous
         &#x97;appellate decision and a restriction upon the State's access to the appellate
         processes. Not surprisingly, we rejected this claim.</p>
      <p>This case is comparable to Mallett. Respondent does not claim that he was denied any
         procedural protections relevant to the determination of his guilt or innocence. Nor does he
         claim that his life sentence was unauthorized by law or that it was the consequence of
         improper procedures. Finally, he does not argue that he has been deprived of any avenue of
         review for correcting errors that may have vitiated the validity of his conviction or
         sentence. For example, respondent does not contend&#x97;and we do not see how he could
         plausibly contend&#x97;that the State has deprived him of any opportunity to challenge his
         conviction on the ground that the improper <span class="star-pagination">*60</span>
         sentencing instruction somehow infected the jury's deliberations about his guilt or about
         the propriety of life imprisonment. Respondent instead claims, as did the defendant in
         Mallett, that an unrelated error must bar the State from relying upon his concededly valid
         conviction, and predicates this claim solely on a restriction upon the State's access to
         appellate &#x97;or, more precisely in this case, postconviction&#x97; remedies.<span
            class="sup">[4]</span> Unlike the defendants in Thompson and Kring, Youngblood wishes to
         have a new trial according to the same procedures, regulated by the same laws, open to the
         same evidence, and capped by the same sentencing limitations that resulted in his
         conviction and his life sentence.<span class="sup">[5]</span>
      </p>
      <p>Obviously, as our decision in Beazell itself makes clear, a procedural protection does not
         become substantial merely because it meets the low threshold that I have discussed. It
         does, however, become insubstantial by failing to do so. Whatever else may be said of the
         factors that determine whether a procedural protection affects substantial rights, it is
         difficult to imagine how a retroactive law could, when viewed from the standpoint of the
         date the offense was committed, implicate substantial rights of any defendant if the law
         does no more than expand the flexibility of postconviction processes available to the State
         with respect to a defendant <span class="star-pagination">*61</span> who is subject to a
         valid conviction and sentence. Indeed, respondent has barely even attempted to articulate
         any justification for the Texas procedure that the legislature abolished. The mere
         possibility of a capricious and unlikely windfall is not the sort of procedural protection
         that could reasonably be judged substantial from the perspective of the defendant at the
         time the offense was committed.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, I concur in the Court's judgment, but not in its opinion.</p>

         110 U. S. 574, 590 (1884) (approving procedural changes "leaving untouched the nature of
         the crime and the amount or degree of proof essential to conviction"). As cases subsequent
         to Calder make clear, this language was not intended to prohibit the application of new
         evidentiary rules in trials for crimes committed before the changes. Thompson v. Missouri,
         171 U. S. 380, 386-387 (1898) (rejecting ex post facto challenge to retroactive application
         of statute making admissible handwritten documents as handwriting exemplars); Hopt, supra,
         at 588-590 (upholding retroactive application of statute making felons competent to
         testify).</p>
      <p>[4] The Court's holding in Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343 (1898), that the Sixth Amendment
         requires a jury panel of 12 persons is also obsolete. Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78
         (1970).</p>
      <p>[1] Art. I, § 10, of the Constitution provides in part: </p>
      <p>"No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque
         and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a
         Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing
         the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility."</p>
      <p>[2] At the time of respondent's offense, it apparently was well established under Texas law
         that, as a general proposition, when a criminal jury rendered a verdict not authorized by
         law the verdict was void at its inception. See, e. g., Ex parte McIver, 586 S. W. 2d 851,
         854 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979); Ocker v. State, 477 S. W. 2d 288, 290 (Tex. Crim. App. 1972).
         However, until the Court of Criminal Appeals decided Bogany, there was some doubt both as
         to whether that general rule would apply to the error in this case and as to whether the
         sentence imposed by the jury in this case was in fact unlawful. See, e. g., Adams v. State,
         642 S. W. 2d 211, 213-214 (Tex. App. 1982) (reforming jury's sentence); Bogany v. State,
         646 S. W. 2d 663, 664-665 (Tex. App.) (stating that jury's sentence could be reformed),
         rev'd, 661 S. W. 2d 957 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983); id., at 960 (McCormick, J., dissenting)
         (contending that supplementary fine was authorized by law). For purposes of this opinion, I
         assume that both the substantive limitation upon respondent's sentence and the procedural
         limitation on the remedial powers of reviewing courts were law at the time that
         respondent's offense was committed.</p>
      <p>[3] The Missouri Supreme Court relied upon the reasoning of the St. Louis Court of Appeals.
         See State v. Kring, <span class="citation no-link">
            <span class="volume">74</span>
            <span class="reporter">Mo.</span>
            <span class="page">612</span>
         </span>, 631 (1881). The relevant passage from the Court of Appeals opinion was quoted (and
         then disavowed) by this Court in Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S. 221, 223-224 (1883): </p>
      <p>"`Formerly it was held in Missouri (State v. Ross, 29 Mo. 32) that, when a conviction is
         had of murder in the second degree on an indictment charging murder in the first degree, if
         this be set aside, the defendant cannot again be tried for murder in the first degree. A
         change introduced by sect. 23 of art. 2 of the Constitution of 1875 has abrogated this
         rule. On the oral argument something was said by counsel for the defendant to the effect
         that under the old rule defendant could not be put on his trial for murder in the first
         degree, and that he could not be affected by the change of the constitutional provision,
         the crime having been committed whilst the old constitution was in force. There is,
         however, nothing in this; this change is a change not in crimes, but in criminal procedure,
         and such changes are not ex post facto. Gut v. State, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/scv/gut-v-state/">

      <p>[4] In Mallett v. North Carolina, 181 U. S. 589 (1901), the unrelated intervening error was
         an incorrect decision by the intermediate appellate court; in this case, it was the
         imposition of a supplementary fine in addition to the life sentence. In Mallett, the
         restriction upon the review process prohibited the State from taking an appeal; in this
         case, it prohibits the courts from saving the conviction and sentence by removing the
         improper supplement.</p>
      <p>[5] Indeed, this case is a fortiori by comparison to Mallett. In that case, the defendant
         would benefit from an evidentiary exclusion at the secondary trial, although that exclusion
         would be entirely the consequence of the appellate court's incorrect interpretation of
         state law and not a consequence of the trial procedures established by North Carolina law
         in effect at the time of the offense. By contrast, in this case the procedures at the
         second trial would be in all relevant respects identical.</p>
