      <p>David C. Larson filed a brief for the Appellate Defense Division, United States Navy-Marine
         Corps Appellate Review Activity, as amicus curiae.</p>
      <p>CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
      <p>This case presents the question whether the jurisdiction of a court-martial convened
         pursuant to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (U. C. M. J.) to try a member of the Armed
         Forces depends on the "service connection" of the offense charged. We hold that it does
         not, and overrule our earlier decision in O'Callahan v. Parker, 395 U. S. 258 (1969).</p>
      <p>While petitioner Richard Solorio was on active duty in the Seventeenth Coast Guard District
         in Juneau, Alaska, he sexually abused two young daughters of fellow coastguardsmen. <span
            class="star-pagination">*437</span> Petitioner engaged in this abuse over a 2-year
         period until he was transferred by the Coast Guard to Governors Island, New York. Coast
         Guard authorities learned of the Alaska crimes only after petitioner's transfer, and
         investigation revealed that he had later committed similar sexual abuse offenses while
         stationed in New York. The Governors Island commander convened a general court-martial to
         try petitioner for crimes alleged to have occurred in Alaska and New York.</p>
      <p>There is no "base" or "post" where Coast Guard personnel live and work in Juneau.
         Consequently, nearly all Coast Guard military personnel reside in the civilian community.
         Petitioner's Alaska offenses were committed in his privately owned home, and the fathers of
         the 10- to 12-year-old victims in Alaska were active duty members of the Coast Guard
         assigned to the same command as petitioner. Petitioner's New York offenses also involved
         daughters of fellow coast-guardsmen, but were committed in Government quarters on the
         Governors Island base.</p>
      <p>After the general court-martial was convened in New York, petitioner moved to dismiss the
         charges for crimes committed in Alaska on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction
         under this Court's decisions in O'Callahan v. Parker, supra, and Relford v. Commandant, U.
         S. Disciplinary Barracks, 401 U. S. 355 (1971).<span class="sup">[1]</span> Ruling that the
         Alaska offenses were not sufficiently "service connected" to be tried in the military
         criminal justice system, the court-martial judge granted the motion to dismiss. The
         Government appealed the dismissal of the charges to the United <span
            class="star-pagination">*438</span> States Coast Guard Court of Military Review, which
         reversed the trial judge's order and reinstated the charges. 21 M. J. 512 (1985).</p>
      <p>The United States Court of Military Appeals affirmed the Court of Military Review,
         concluding that the Alaska offenses were service connected within the meaning of O'Callahan
         and Relford. 21 M. J. 251 (1986). Stating that "not every off-base offense against a
         servicemember's dependent is service-connected," the court reasoned that "sex offenses
         against young children . . . have a continuing effect on the victims and their families and
         ultimately on the morale of any military unit or organization to which the family member is
         assigned." Id., at 256. In reaching its holding, the court also weighed a number of other
         factors, including: the interest of Alaska civilian officials in prosecuting petitioner;
         the hardship on the victims, who had moved from Alaska, that would result if they were
         called to testify both at a civilian trial in Alaska and at the military proceeding in New
         York; and the benefits to petitioner and the Coast Guard from trying the Alaska and New
         York offenses together.<span class="sup">[2]</span> This Court subsequently granted
         certiorari pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1259(3) (1982 ed., Supp. III) to review the decision
         of the Court of Military Appeals. 476 U. S. 1181 (1986). We now affirm.</p>
      <p>The Constitution grants to Congress the power "[t]o make Rules for the Government and
         Regulation of the land and naval Forces." U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 14. Exercising
         this authority, Congress has empowered courts-martial to try servicemen for the crimes
         proscribed by the U. C. M. J., <span class="star-pagination">*439</span> Arts. 2, 17, 10 U.
         S. C. §§ 802, 817. The Alaska offenses with which petitioner was charged are each described
         in the U. C. M. J. See n. 1, supra. Thus it is not disputed that the court-martial convened
         in New York possessed the statutory authority to try petitioner on the Alaska child abuse
         specifications.</p>
      <p>In an unbroken line of decisions from 1866 to 1960, this Court interpreted the Constitution
         as conditioning the proper exercise of court-martial jurisdiction over an offense on one
         factor: the military status of the accused. Gosa v. Mayden, 413 U. S. 665, 673 (1973)
         (plurality opinion); see Kinsella v. United States ex rel. Singleton, 361 U. S. 234,
         240-241, 243 (1960); Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 22-23 (1957) (plurality opinion); Grafton
         v. United States, 206 U. S. 333, 348 (1907); Johnson v. Sayre, 158 U. S. 109, 114 (1895);
         Smith v. Whitney, 116 U. S. 167, 183-185 (1886); Coleman v. Tennessee, 97 U. S. 509,
         513-514 (1879); Ex parte Milligan, <span class="citation no-link">

         </span>, 123 (1866); cf. United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11, 15 (1955);
         Kahn v. Anderson, 255 U. S. 1, 6-9 (1921); Givens v. Zerbst, 255 U. S. 11, 20-21 (1921).
         This view was premised on what the Court described as the "natural meaning" of Art. I, § 8,
         cl. 14, as well as the Fifth Amendment's exception for "cases arising in the land or naval
         forces." Reid v. Covert, supra, at 19; United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, supra, at 15.
         As explained in Kinsella v. Singleton, supra:</p> "The test for jurisdiction . . . is one
      of status, namely, whether the accused in the court-martial proceeding is a person who can be
      regarded as falling within the term `land and naval Forces.' . . ." Id., at 240-241 (emphasis
      in original). "Without contradiction, the materials . . . show that military jurisdiction has
      always been based on the `status' of the accused, rather than on the nature of the offense. To
      say that military jurisdiction `defies definition in terms of military "status" is to defy the
      unambiguous <span class="star-pagination">*440</span> language of Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, as well
      as the historical background thereof and the precedents with reference thereto." Id., at 243.
         <p>Implicit in the military status test was the principle that determinations concerning
         the scope of court-martial jurisdiction over offenses committed by servicemen was a matter
         reserved for Congress:</p> "[T]he rights of men in the armed forces must perforce be
      conditioned to meet certain overriding demands of discipline and duty, and the civil courts
      are not the agencies which must determine the precise balance to be struck in this adjustment.
      The Framers expressly entrusted that task to Congress." Burns v. Wilson, 346 U. S. 137, 140
      (1953) (plurality opinion) (footnote omitted). <p>See also Coleman v. Tennessee, supra, at
         514; Warren, The Bill of Rights and the Military, 37 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 181, 187 (1962).<span
            class="sup">[3]</span>
      </p>
      <p>In 1969, the Court in O'Callahan v. Parker departed from the military status test and
         announced the "new constitutional principle" that a military tribunal may not try a
         serviceman charged with a crime that has no service connection. See Gosa v. Mayden, supra,
         at 673. Applying this principle, the O'Callahan Court held that a serviceman's off-base
         sexual assault on a civilian with no connection with the military could not be tried by
         court-martial. On reexamination of <span class="star-pagination">*441</span> O'Callahan, we
         have decided that the service connection test announced in that decision should be
         abandoned.</p>
      <p>The constitutional grant of power to Congress to regulate the Armed Forces, Art. I, § 8,
         cl. 14, appears in the same section as do the provisions granting Congress authority, inter
         alia, to regulate commerce among the several States, to coin money, and to declare war. On
         its face there is no indication that the grant of power in Clause 14 was any less plenary
         than the grants of other authority to Congress in the same section. Whatever doubts there
         might be about the extent of Congress' power under Clause 14 to make rules for the
         "Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces," that power surely embraces the
         authority to regulate the conduct of persons who are actually members of the Armed
         Services. As noted by Justice Harlan in his O'Callahan dissent, there is no evidence in the
         debates over the adoption of the Constitution that the Framers intended the language of
         Clause 14 to be accorded anything other than its plain meaning.<span class="sup">[4]</span>
         Alexander Hamilton described these powers of Congress "essential to the common defense" as
         follows:</p> "These powers ought to exist without limitation, because it is impossible to
      foresee or define the extent and variety of national exigencies, or the correspondent extent
      and variety of the means which may be necessary to satisfy them. . . . ..... ". . . Are fleets
      and armies and revenues necessary for this purpose [common safety]? The government of the
      Union must be empowered to pass all laws, and to make all regulations which have relation to
      them." The Federalist No. 23, pp. 152-154 (E. Bourne ed. 1947). <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*442</span> The O'Callahan Court's historical foundation for
         its holding rests on the view that "[b]oth in England prior to the American Revolution and
         in our own national history military trial of soldiers committing civilian offenses has
         been viewed with suspicion." 395 U. S., at 268. According to the Court, the historical
         evidence demonstrates that, during the late 17th and 18th centuries in England as well as
         the early years of this country, courts-martial did not have authority to try soldiers for
         civilian offenses. The Court began with a review of the 17th-century struggle in England
         between Parliament and the Crown over control of the scope of court-martial jurisdiction.
         As stated by the Court, this conflict was resolved when William and Mary accepted the Bill
         of Rights in 1689, which granted Parliament exclusive authority to define the jurisdiction
         of military tribunals. See ibid. The Court correctly observed that Parliament, wary of
         abuses of military power, exercised its new authority sparingly.<span class="sup"
            >[5]</span> Indeed, a statute enacted by Parliament in 1689 provided for court-martial
         only for the crimes of sedition, mutiny, and desertion, and exempted members of militia
         from its scope. Mutiny Act of 1689, 1 Wm. &amp;amp; Mary, ch. 5.</p>
      <p>The O'Callahan Court's representation of English history following the Mutiny Act of 1689,
         however, is less than accurate. In particular, the Court posited that "[i]t was . . . the
         rule in Britain at the time of the American Revolution that a soldier could not be tried
         for a civilian offense committed in Britain; instead military officers were required to use
         their energies and office to insure that the accused soldier would be tried before a civil
         court." 395 U. S., at 269. In making this statement, the Court was apparently referring to
         Section <span class="star-pagination">*443</span> XI, Article I, of the British Articles of
         War in effect at the time of the Revolution.<span class="sup">[6]</span> This Article
         provided:</p> "Whenever any Officer or Soldier shall be accused of a Capital Crime, or of
      having used Violence, or committed any Offence against the Persons or Property of Our
      Subjects,. . . the Commanding Officer, and Officers of every Regiment, Troop, or Party to
      which the . . . accused shall belong, are hereby required, upon Application duly made by, or
      in behalf of the Party or Parties injured, to use . . . utmost Endeavors to deliver over such
      accused. . . to the Civil Magistrate." British Articles of War of 1774, reprinted in G. Davis,
      Military Law of the United States 581, 589 (3d rev. ed. 1915). <p>This provision, however, is
         not the sole statement in the Articles bearing on court-martial jurisdiction over civilian
         offenses. Specifically, Section XIV, Article XVI, provided that all officers and soldiers
         who</p> "shall maliciously destroy any Property whatsoever belonging to any of Our
      Subjects, unless by Order of the then Commander in Chief of Our Forces, to annoy Rebels or
      other Enemies in Arms against Us, he or they that shall be found guilty of offending herein
      shall (besides such Penalties as they are liable to by law) be punished according to the
      Nature and Degree of the Offence, by the Judgment of a Regimental or General Court Martial."
      Id., at 593. <p>Under this provision, military tribunals had jurisdiction over offenses
         punishable under civil law. Nelson &amp;amp; Westbrook <span class="star-pagination"
            >*444</span> 11. Accordingly, the O'Callahan Court erred in suggesting that, at the time
         of the American Revolution, military tribunals in England were available "only where
         ordinary civil courts were unavailable." 395 U. S., at 269, and n. 11.</p>
      <p>The history of early American practice furnishes even less support to O'Callahan's
         historical thesis. The American Articles of War of 1776, which were based on the British
         Articles, contained a provision similar to Section XI, Article I, of the British Articles,
         requiring commanding officers to deliver over to civil magistrates any officer or soldier
         accused of "a capital crime, . . . having used violence, or . . . any offence against the
         persons or property of the good people of any of the United American States" upon
         application by or on behalf of an injured party. American Articles of War of 1776, Section
         X, Article I, reprinted in 2 Winthrop 1494. It has been postulated that American
         courts-martial had jurisdiction over the crimes described in this provision where no
         application for a civilian trial was made by or on behalf of the injured civilian.<span
            class="sup">[7]</span> Indeed, American military records reflect trials by court-martial
         during the late 18th century for offenses against civilians and punishable under civil law,
         such as theft and assault.<span class="sup">[8]</span>
      </p>
      <p>The authority to try soldiers for civilian crimes may be found in the much-disputed
         "general article" of the 1776 Articles of War, which allowed court-martial jurisdiction
         over "[a]ll crimes not capital, and all disorders and neglects which officers and soldiers
         may be guilty of, to the prejudice of good order and military discipline." American
         Articles of War of 1776, Section XVIII, Article 5, reprinted in 2 Winthrop 1503. <span
            class="star-pagination">*445</span> Some authorities, such as those cited by the
         O'Callahan Court, interpreted this language as limiting court-martial jurisdiction to
         crimes that had a direct impact on military discipline.<span class="sup">[9]</span> Several
         others, however, have interpreted the language as encompassing all noncapital crimes
         proscribed by the civil law.<span class="sup">[10]</span> Even W. Winthrop, the authority
         relied on most extensively by the majority in O'Callahan, recognized that military
         authorities read the general article to include crimes "committed upon or against civilians
         . . . at or near a military camp or post." 2 Winthrop 1124, 1126, n. 1.</p>
      <p>We think the history of court-martial jurisdiction in England and in this country during
         the 17th and 18th centuries is far too ambiguous to justify the restriction on the plain
         language of Clause 14 which O'Callahan imported into it.<span class="sup">[11]</span>
         <span class="star-pagination">*446</span> There is no doubt that the English practice
         during this period shows a strong desire in that country to transfer from the Crown to
         Parliament the control of the scope of court-martial jurisdiction. And it is equally true
         that Parliament was chary in granting jurisdiction to courts-martial, although not as chary
         as the O'Callahan opinion suggests. But reading Clause 14 consistently with its plain
         language does not disserve that concern; Congress, and not the Executive, was given the
         authority to make rules for the regulation of the Armed Forces.</p>
      <p>The O'Callahan Court cryptically stated: "The 17th century conflict over the proper role of
         courts-martial in the enforcement of the domestic criminal law was not, however, merely a
         dispute over what organ of government had jurisdiction. It also involved substantive
         disapproval of the general use of military courts for trial of ordinary crimes." 395 U. S.,
         at 268. But such disapproval in England at the time of William and Mary hardly proves that
         the Framers of the Constitution, contrary to the plenary language in which they conferred
         the power on Congress, meant to freeze court-martial usage at a particular time in such a
         way that Congress might not change it. The unqualified language of Clause 14 suggests that
         whatever these concerns, they were met by vesting in Congress, rather than the Executive,
         authority to make rules for the government of the military.<span class="sup">[12]</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*447</span> Given the dearth of historical support for the
         O'Callahan holding, there is overwhelming force to Justice Harlan's reasoning that the
         plain language of the Constitution, as interpreted by numerous decisions of this Court
         preceding O'Callahan, should be controlling on the subject of court-martial jurisdiction.
         395 U. S., at 275-278 (dissenting); cf. Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services,
         436 U. S. 658, 696 (1978) ("[W]e ought not `disregard the implications of an exercise of
         judicial authority assumed to be proper for [100] years' "), quoting Brown Shoe Co. v.
         United States, 370 U. S. 294, 307 (1962).</p>
      <p>Decisions of this Court after O'Callahan have also emphasized that Congress has primary
         responsibility for the delicate task of balancing the rights of servicemen against the
         needs of the military. As we recently reiterated, "[j]udicial deference . . . is at its
         apogee when legislative action under the congressional authority to raise and support
         armies and make rules and regulations for their governance is challenged.' " Goldman v.
         Weinberger, 475 U. S. 503, 508 (1986), quoting Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 70
         (1981). <span class="star-pagination">*448</span> Since O'Callahan, we have adhered to this
         principle of deference in a variety of contexts where, as here, the constitutional rights
         of servicemen were implicated. See, e. g., Goldman v. Weinberger, supra, at 509-510 (free
         exercise of religion); Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U. S. 296, 300-305 (1983) (racial
         discrimination); Rostker v. Goldberg, supra, at 64-66, 70-71 (sex discrimination); Brown v.
         Glines, 444 U. S. 348, 357, 360 (1980) (free expression); Middendorf v. Henry, 425 U. S.
         25, 43 (1976) (right to counsel in summary court-martial proceedings); Schlesinger v.
         Councilman, 420 U. S. 738, 753 (1975) (availability of injunctive relief from an impending
         court-martial); Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733, 756 (1974) (due process rights and freedom
         of expression).</p>
      <p>The notion that civil courts are "ill equipped" to establish policies regarding matters of
         military concern is substantiated by experience under the service connection approach.
         Chappell v. Wallace, supra, at 305. In his O'Callahan dissent, Justice Harlan forecasted
         that "the infinite permutations of possibly relevant factors are bound to create confusion
         and proliferate litigation over the [court-martial] jurisdiction issue." 395 U. S., at 284.
         In fact, within two years after O'Callahan, this Court found it necessary to expound on the
         meaning of the decision, enumerating a myriad of factors for courts to weigh in determining
         whether an offense is service connected. Relford v. Commandant, U. S. Disciplinary
         Barracks, 401 U. S. 355 (1971). Yet the service connection approach, even as elucidated in
         Relford, has proved confusing and difficult for military courts to apply.<span class="sup"
            >[13]</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*449</span> Since O'Callahan and Relford, military courts
         have identified numerous categories of offenses requiring specialized analysis of the
         service connection requirement. For example, the courts have highlighted subtle
         distinctions among offenses committed on a military base, offenses committed off-base,
         offenses arising from events occurring both on and off a base, and offenses committed on or
         near the boundaries of a base.<span class="sup">[14]</span> Much time and energy has also
         been expended in litigation over other jurisdictional factors, such as the status of the
         victim of the crime, and the results are difficult to reconcile.<span class="sup"
            >[15]</span> The confusion created by the complexity of the service connection
         requirement, however, is perhaps best illustrated in the area of off-base drug
            offenses.<span class="sup">[16]</span> Soon after O'Callahan, the Court of Military
         Appeals held that drug offenses were of such "special military significance" that their
         trial by court-martial was unaffected by the decision. United States v. Beeker, 18 U. S. C.
         M. A. 563, 565, 40 C. M. R. 275, 277 (1969). Nevertheless, the court has changed its
         position on <span class="star-pagination">*450</span> the issue no less than two times
         since Beeker, each time basing its decision on O'Callahan and Relford.<span class="sup"
            >[17]</span>
      </p>
      <p>When considered together with the doubtful foundations of O'Callahan, the confusion wrought
         by the decision leads us to conclude that we should read Clause 14 in accord with the plain
         meaning of its language as we did in the many years before O'Callahan was decided. That
         case's novel approach to court-martial jurisdiction must bow "to the lessons of experience
         and the force of better reasoning." Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp;amp; Gas Co., 285 U. S.
         393, 406-408 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). We therefore hold that the requirements of
         the Constitution are not violated where, as here, a court-martial <span
            class="star-pagination">*451</span> is convened to try a serviceman who was a member of
         the Armed Services at the time of the offense charged.<span class="sup">[18]</span> The

      <p>Affirmed.</p>
      <p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in the judgment.</p>
      <p>Today's unnecessary overruling of precedent is most unwise. The opinion of the United
         States Court of Military Appeals demonstrates that petitioner's offenses were sufficiently
         "service connected" to confer jurisdiction on the military tribunal. Unless this Court
         disagrees with that determination &#x97; and I would be most surprised to be told that it
         does &#x97; it has no business reaching out to reexamine the decisions in O'Callahan v.
         Parker, 395 U. S. 258 (1969), and Relford v. Commandant, U. S. Disciplinary Barracks, 401
         U. S. 355 (1971). While there might be some dispute about the exact standard to be applied
         in deciding whether to overrule prior decisions, I had thought that we all could agree that
         such drastic action is only appropriate when essential to <span class="star-pagination"
            >*452</span> the disposition of a case or controversy before the Court.<span class="sup"
            >[*]</span> The fact that any five Members of the Court have the power to reconsider
         settled precedents at random, does not make that practice legitimate.</p>

         be affirmed.</p>
      <p>JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, and with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins in
         all but the last paragraph, dissenting.</p>
      <p>Less than 20 years ago, this Court held in O'Callahan v. Parker, 395 U. S. 258 (1969),
         that, to be subject to trial by court-martial, a criminal offense charged against a member
         of the Armed Forces had to be "service connected," lest the phrase "cases arising in the
         land or naval forces" in the Fifth Amendment "be expanded to deprive every member of the
         armed services of the benefits of an indictment by a grand jury and a trial by a jury of
         his peers." Id., at 273. Today the Court overrules O'Callahan. In doing so, it disregards
         constitutional language and principles of stare decisis in its singleminded determination
         to subject members of our Armed Forces to the unrestrained control of the military in the
         area of criminal justice. I dissent.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>I</h2>
      <p>The majority begins by assuming that the limitation on court-martial jurisdiction
         enunciated in O'Callahan was based on the power of Congress, contained in Art. I, § 8, cl.
         14, "[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces." It
         then rejects this asserted limitation of congressional power on the ground that the Framers
         intended to give Congress plenary authority over the <span class="star-pagination"
            >*453</span> government of the military. But the Court in O'Callahan did not simply
         address whether Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, granted Congress the authority to create court-martial
         jurisdiction over all crimes committed by members of the Armed Forces. Congress' Article I
         power to regulate the Armed Forces is limited by the Fifth Amendment right to indictment or
         presentment by a grand jury and the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury.<span
            class="sup">[1]</span> "[T]he constitutional grant of power to Congress to regulate the
         armed forces," this Court has previously stated, "itself does not empower Congress to
         deprive people of trials under Bill of Rights safeguards, and we are not willing to hold
         that power to circumvent those safeguards should be inferred through the Necessary and
         Proper Clause." United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11, 21-22 (1955). The
         majority simply disregards the limitations the Bill of Rights imposes on the reach of Art.
         I, § 8, cl. 14.</p>
      <p>The rights to grand jury process and to trial by jury are, of course, of restricted
         application in military cases. The Fifth Amendment excepts from the grand jury requirement
         "cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in
         time of War or public danger,"<span class="sup">[2]</span> and the <span
            class="star-pagination">*454</span> Court has held this exception applicable to the
         Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury as well. Ex parte Milligan, <span
            class="citation no-link">
            <span class="volume">4</span>
            <span class="reporter">Wall.</span>
            <span class="page">2</span>
         </span>, 123 (1867). But the text of the exception is inconsistent with the majority's
         conclusion that the only relevant factor in determining whether a court-martial has
         jurisdiction over a case is the status of the defendant as a member of the Armed
            Services.<span class="sup">[3]</span>
      </p>
      <p>The Fifth Amendment's exception covers only "cases arising in the land and naval forces"
         (emphasis added). It makes no reference to the status of the individual committing the
         crime. Had that been the Framers' intent, it would have been easy to have said so, given
         that the grand jury provision of the Amendment, which states that "[n]o Person shall be
         held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or
         indictment of a Grand Jury," speaks not in terms of "crimes" or "cases," but of individual
         defendants. Nonetheless, the exception contained in the Fifth Amendment is expressed &#x97;
         and applies by its terms &#x97; only to cases arising in the Armed Forces. O'Callahan
         addressed not whether Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, empowered Congress to create court-martial
         jurisdiction over all crimes committed by service members, but rather whether Congress, in
         exercising that power, had encroached upon the rights of members of Armed Forces whose
         cases did not "arise in" the Armed Forces. This is clear from the Court's statement of its
         holding in O'Callahan:</p> "We have concluded that the crime to be under military
      jurisdiction must be service connected, lest `cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in
      the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger,' as used in the Fifth
      Amendment, be expanded to deprive every <span class="star-pagination">*455</span> member of
      the armed services of the benefits of an indictment by a grand jury and a trial by a jury of
      his peers." 395 U. S., at 272-273 (footnote omitted).<span class="sup">[4]</span>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*456</span> The protections afforded individuals by the Fifth
         and Sixth Amendments are central to our constitutional scheme of justice. The right to
         trial by jury, in particular, "ranks very high in our catalogue of constitutional
         safeguards." United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S., at 16. These protections
         should not be lightly abrogated. Consequently, the exception in the Fifth Amendment for
         cases arising in the Armed Forces must be strictly construed. This was the basis for the
         Court's conclusion, in Toth, that the power to authorize trial by court-martial should be
         limited to " `the least possible power adequate to the end proposed.' " Id., at 23
         (emphasis omitted), quoting Anderson v. Dunn, <span class="citation">

            </a>
         </span>, 231 (1821).</p>
      <p>The historical evidence considered by the Court in O'Callahan is therefore relevant, not to
         what the Framers intended to include in the scope of the congressional power to regulate
         the Armed Forces in Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, but to what the Framers, wary of military
         jurisdiction and familiar with strong restrictions on the scope of that jurisdiction,
         considered "cases arising in the armed forces." Even assuming that they intended to assign
         control over the scope of the Article I power to the Legislature, this does not imply that
         the meaning of the Fifth Amendment's "arising in" exception can be interpreted without
         reference to the practices of that time.</p>
      <p>In that respect it is significant that the British political and legal writing of the 17th
         and 18th centuries demonstrates a longstanding suspicion of broad court-martial
         jurisdiction. This suspicion was well known in colonial America, and was based on familiar
            history.<span class="sup">[5]</span> British writers and legislators <span
            class="star-pagination">*457</span> took a narrow view of the appropriate scope of
         court-martial jurisdiction, which manifested itself in a very limited grant of authority to
         try offenses by court-martial during the period of which the Framers would have been most
         acutely aware. See, e. g., M. Hale, The History of the Common Law of England 42-43 (6th ed.
         1820). Not only was that jurisdiction narrow, it was expressly limited to cases having some
         connection with the military. The test was not one of status, but one of military
         relationship. See S. Adye, A Treatise on Courts Martial 60 (1786) ("The crimes that are
         cognizable by a court martial, as repugnant to military discipline, are pointed out by the
         mutiny act and articles of war . . . and as to other crimes which officers and soldiers
         being guilty of, are to be tried for by the ordinary course of law, in like manner with
         other subjects"); see also 1 C. Clode, Military Forces of the Crown; Their Administration
         and Government 158 <span class="star-pagination">*458</span> (1869) ("It has been a subject
         of controversy to distinguish the offences that are purely Military (and therefore properly
         within the cognizance of a Court-martial), from others that are Civil or Political (and
         therefore properly within the cognizance of the civil tribunals of the community)"); Grant
         v. Gould, 2 H. Bl. 69, 99-100, 126 Eng. Rep. 434, 450 (C. P. 1792) ("In this country, all
         the delinquencies of soldiers are not triable, as in most countries in Europe, by martial
         law; but where they are ordinary offences against the civil peace they are tried by the
         common law courts. . . . The object of the mutiny act . . . is to create a court invested
         with authority to try those who are a part of the army . . . and the object of the trial is
         limited to breaches of military duty") (emphasis omitted). The reach of military law in
         Britain at the time of the Revolution thus permitted courts-martial only for offenses
         committed by members of the Armed Forces that had some connection with their military
         service.</p>
      <p>The majority disputes the O'Callahan Court's suggestion that the British Articles of War
         forbade the trial of civil offenses by court-martial. The Court points to Section XIV,
         Article XVI, of the British Articles of War of 1774, reprinted in G. Davis, Military Law of
         the United States 581, 593 (3d rev. ed. 1915), which provided:</p> "All Officers and
      Soldiers are to behave themselves orderly in Quarters, and on their March; and whosoever shall
      commit any Waste or Spoil either in Walks of Trees, Parks, Warrens, Fish Ponds, Houses or
      Gardens, Corn Fields, Inclosures or Meadows, or shall maliciously destroy any Property
      whatsoever belonging to any of Our Subjects, unless by order of the then Commander in Chief of
      Our Forces, to annoy Rebels or other Enemies in Arms against Us, he or they that shall be
      found guilty of offending herein shall (besides such Penalties as they are liable to by law)
      be punished according to the Nature and Degree of the Offence, by the Judgment of a Regimental
      or General Court Martial." <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*459</span> The majority contends that this provision
         counters any argument that court-martial jurisdiction in Britain at the time of the
         American Revolution was in any respect limited to offenses not punishable by civil law.
         Ante, at 443. The latter provision, however, appears in a section of the Articles of War
         captioned "Of Duties in Quarters, in Garrison, or in the Field," and its text suggests that
         the activities it forbade were considered derelictions of military duty, and were
         punishable by court-martial on that basis.<span class="sup">[6]</span>
      </p>
      <p>American colonists shared the British suspicion of broad military authority in
         courts-martial. One of the grievances stated in the Declaration of Independence was King
         George III's assent to "pretended Legislation: For quartering large bodies of armed troops
         among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they
         should commit on the Inhabitants of these States." The Framers thus were concerned both
         with protecting the rights of those subjected to courts-martial, and with preventing
         courts-martial from permitting soldiers to get away with murder &#x97; literally &#x97; in
         the civilian community. This "known hostility of the American people to any interference by
         the military with the regular administration of justice in the civil courts," Coleman v.
         Tennessee, 97 U. S. 509, 514 (1879), makes it unlikely that the Framers considered any
         crime committed by a member of the Armed Forces, regardless of <span
            class="star-pagination">*460</span> its lack of connection to military service, to give
         rise to a "case arising in" the Armed Forces of the new Nation.<span class="sup">[7]</span>
      </p>
      <p>This is borne out by provisions in the American Articles of 1776 that are comparable to
         those in the British Articles of War of 1774. See Section X, Article I, reprinted in 2 W.
         Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 1494 (1896); Section XIII, Article 16, reprinted in 2
         Winthrop, supra, at 1497; Section XVIII, Article 5, reprinted in 2 Winthrop, supra, at
         1503. The provisions created military offenses where the crimes involved were service
         connected. This tradition continued after the adoption of the Constitution. With respect to
         the 1874 Articles of War, for example, Davis wrote:</p> "As to whether an act which is a
      civil crime is also a military offense no rule can be laid down which will cover all cases,
      for the reason that what may be a military offense under certain circumstances may lose that
      character under others. . . . But if the act be committed on a military reservation, or other
      ground occupied by the army, or in its neighborhood, so as to be in the constructive presence
      of the army; or if committed while on duty, particularly if the injury be to a member of the
      community whom it is the offender's duty to protect; or if committed <span
         class="star-pagination">*461</span> in the presence of other soldiers, or while in uniform;
      or if the offender use his military position, or that of another, for the purpose of
      intimidation or other unlawful influence or object &#x97; such facts would be sufficient to
      make it prejudicial to military discipline . . . ." Davis, supra, at 476. <p>Viewed
         historically, then, O'Callahan's recognition of the service connection requirement did not
         signify a meaningful change in what could be tried in courts-martial. Quite the reverse:
         not until the enactment of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 1950 did Congress
         attempt to give courts-martial the authority to try the crimes of murder and rape committed
         in peacetime within the United States. See Duke &amp;amp; Vogel, The Constitution and the
         Standing Army: Another Problem of Court-Martial Jurisdiction, 12 Vand. L. Rev. 435, 452-453
         (1960). Common-law felonies in peacetime were only brought within the court-martial
         jurisdiction in 1916. Wiener, Courts-Martial and the Bill of Rights: The Original Practice
         I, 72 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 10-12 (1958). The Framers' conception of what could properly be
         tried in a court-martial must have informed their understanding of what cases arise in the
         Armed Forces, thus permitting what would otherwise be unconstitutional infringements of
         Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. The relatively recent expansion of the authority of
         military tribunals appears to disregard the Framers' understanding.</p>
      <p>Instead of acknowledging the Fifth Amendment limits on the crimes triable in a
         court-martial, the Court simply ignores them. But "[t]he concept that the Bill of Rights
         and other constitutional protections against arbitrary government are inoperative when they
         become inconvenient or when expediency dictates otherwise is a very dangerous doctrine and
         if allowed to flourish would destroy the benefit of a written Constitution and undermine
         the basis of our Government." Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 14 (1957) (plurality opinion).
            <span class="star-pagination">*462</span> The limitations may not, in the view of the
         majority, be desirable, but that does not mean they do not exist.</p>
      <p>The requirement of service connection recognized in O'Callahan has a legitimate basis in
         constitutional language and a solid historical foundation. It should be applied in this
         case.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>II</h2>
      <p>Application of the service connection requirement of O'Callahan, as further elaborated in
         Relford v. Commandant, U. S. Disciplinary Barracks, 401 U. S. 355 (1971), demonstrates that
         petitioner's Alaska crimes do not have an adequate service connection to support the
         exercise of court-martial jurisdiction. Petitioner's offenses did not detract from the
         performance of his military duties. He committed these crimes while properly absent from
         his unit, and there was no connection between his assigned duties and his crimes. Nor did
         petitioner's crimes threaten people or areas under military control. The crimes were
         committed in petitioner's private home in the civilian community in Juneau, where there is
         not even a base for Coast Guard personnel. Petitioner's acts were not likely to go
         unpunished; the court-martial judge determined that the offenses were of a type
         traditionally prosecuted by civilian courts, that such courts were available, and that,
         while the Alaska courts had deferred prosecution in light of the court-martial proceeding,
         the State had not declined to prosecute the offenses. Nor did the crimes implicate any
         authority stemming from the war power; they were committed within the territorial United
         States while the Nation was at peace.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the crimes caused no measurable interference with military relationships. Though
         the victims were dependents of Coast Guard members, the court-martial judge found that
         there was only de minimis military interaction between petitioner and the fathers of the
         victims, and that the relationships between petitioner and the families of the victims
            <span class="star-pagination">*463</span> "were founded primarily upon the ages and
         activities of the children and additionally upon common sporting interests, common spousal
         interest and employment and neighborly relationships," App. to Pet. for Cert. 58a, rather
         than the connection of petitioner and the families through the Coast Guard.<span
            class="sup">[8]</span> Because the crimes did not take place in an area within military
         control or have any effect on petitioner's military duties, their commission posed no
         challenge to the maintenance of order in the local command. The military judge found that
         the Government had not demonstrated any impact of the offenses on "morale, discipline, [or]
         the reputation or the integrity of the Coast Guard in Juneau." The only connection between
         the military and the offenses at issue was the fact that the victims were military
         dependents. But the military judge found explicitly that the military association of
         petitioner and the victims' fathers did not facilitate petitioner's crimes,<span
            class="sup">[9]</span> and that "[t]he impact apparent in this case, that is, on the
         parents and the victims themselves is no different than that which would be produced by [a]
         civilian perpetrator." Id., at 57a.</p>
      <p>The military judge, after properly reviewing the Relford factors, concluded correctly that
         they did not render petitioner's <span class="star-pagination">*464</span> offenses service
         connected and dismissed the charges. Engaging in what can only be described as
         impermissible appellate factfinding,<span class="sup">[10]</span> the Coast Guard Court of
         Military <span class="star-pagination">*465</span> Review reversed the dismissal. 21 M. J.
         512 (1985). It concluded that the military judge's finding that the offenses had had no
         impact on morale or discipline was erroneous because the judge should have considered the
         effect the offenses would have had on the community in Juneau had they come to light while
         the victims and their families were still in Alaska, and the impact of the offenses on
         morale and discipline at Governors Island. Without remanding for further factfinding, the
         court held that the Alaska offenses had a direct impact upon the good order, discipline,
         morale, and welfare of Coast Guard personnel at Governors Island. Id., at 519. It further
         asserted, again without basis in the facts found by the military judge, that the Coast
         Guard's interest in deterring the offenses was greater than that of the civilian
         authorities, and that the concerns of the victims' parents would have been different had
         the offender been a civilian. Id., at 519-520. On the basis of these newly found facts, the
         Court of Military Review held petitioner's crime sufficiently service connected to justify
         the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction. Id., at 522.</p>
      <p>The Court of Military Appeals affirmed. 21 M. J. 251 (1986). While conceding that its
         "precedents involving off-base sex offenses against civilian dependents of military
         personnel would point to a different conclusion," id., at 254, it concluded that a "recent
         development in our society" &#x97; specifically, an increase in concern for the victims of
         crimes &#x97; meant that sex offenses committed against young children of members of the
         military, which would have "a continuing effect on the victims and their families," id., at
         256, sufficed to establish service connection.</p>
      <p>The military judge's straightforward application of O'Callahan and Relford was plainly
         correct given the facts as he found them, facts that the reviewing courts have not
         demonstrated to have been clearly erroneous. The Court of Military <span
            class="star-pagination">*466</span> Appeals' apparent conclusion that serious or
         disturbing crimes committed upon military dependents sufficed to create court-martial
         jurisdiction ignored this Court's prior decisions.</p>
      <p>The majority asserts that "the service connection approach, even as elucidated in Relford,
         has proved confusing and difficult for military courts to apply." Ante, at 448. It is true
         that the test requires a careful, case-specific factual inquiry. But this is not beyond the
         capacity of the military courts. Indeed, the military judge in this case engaged in a
         thorough and thoughtful application of the Relford factors. It should not be surprising
         that such determinations may at times be difficult or time consuming or require the drawing
         of narrow distinctions. The trial of any person before a court-martial encompasses a
         deliberate decision to withhold procedural protections guaranteed by the Constitution.
         Denial of these protections is a very serious matter. The Framers declined to draw an easy
         line, like that established by the Court today, which would sweep an entire class of
         Americans beyond the reach of the Bill of Rights. Instead, they required that the
         protections of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments be applied in any case not "arising in" the
         Armed Forces. This requirement must not be discarded simply because it may be less
         expeditious than the majority deems appropriate.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>III</h2>
      <p>O'Callahan v. Parker remains correct and workable today. The Court nonetheless insists on
         reopening a question which was finally and properly resolved in 1969. In doing so, it shows
         a blatant disregard for principles of stare decisis, and makes more dubious the presumption
         "that bedrock principles are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of
         individuals." Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 265 (1986). This in turn undermines "the
         integrity of our constitutional system of government, both in appearance and in fact."
            <span class="star-pagination">*467</span> Ibid.; see also Pollock v. Farmers' Loan
         &amp;amp; Trust Co., 158 U. S. 601, 663, (1895) (Harlan, J., dissenting).</p>
      <p>The Court's willingness to overturn precedent may reflect in part its conviction,
         frequently expressed this Term, that members of the Armed Forces may be subjected virtually
         without limit to the vagaries of military control. See United States v. Stanley, post, p.
         669; United States v. Johnson, 481 U. S. 681 (1987). But the Court's decision today has,
         potentially, the broadest reach of any of these cases. Unless Congress acts to avoid the
         consequences of this case, every member of our Armed Forces, whose active duty members
         number in the millions, can now be subjected to court-martial jurisdiction &#x97; without
         grand jury indictment or trial by jury &#x97; for any offense, from tax fraud to passing a
         bad check, regardless of its lack of relation to "military discipline, morale and fitness."
         Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U. S. 738, 761, n. 34 (1975). Today's decision deprives our
         military personnel of procedural protections that are constitutionally mandated in trials
         for purely civilian offenses. The Court's action today reflects contempt, both for the
         members of our Armed Forces and for the constitutional safeguards intended to protect us
         all. I dissent.</p>

      <p>[*] Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the Defense Appellate Division,
         United States Army, by Brooks B. La Grua; and for Vietnam Veterans of America by Ronald
         William Meister and Barton F. Stichman.</p>
      <p>[1] Petitioner was charged with 14 specifications alleging indecent liberties, lascivious
         acts, and indecent assault in violation of U. C. M. J., Art. 134, 10 U. S. C. § 934, 6
         specifications alleging assault in violation of Art. 128, 10 U. S. C. § 928, and 1
         specification alleging attempted rape in violation of Art. 80, 10 U. S. C. § 880. The
         specifications alleged to have occurred in Alaska included all of the Article 128 and
         Article 80 specifications and 7 of the Article 134 specifications.</p>
      <p>[2] Following the decision of the Court of Military Appeals, petitioner unsuccessfully
         sought a stay from that court and from Chief Justice Burger. The court-martial reconvened
         and petitioner was convicted of 8 of the 14 specifications alleging offenses committed in
         Alaska and 4 of the 7 specifications alleging offenses committed in New York. These
         convictions are currently under review by the convening authority pursuant to U. C. M. J.,
         Art. 60, 10 U. S. C. § 860.</p>
      <p>[3] One pre-1969 decision of this Court suggests that the constitutional power of Congress
         to authorize trial by court-martial must be limited to "the least possible power adequate
         to the end proposed." United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11, 23 (1955)
         (emphasis deleted). Broadly read, this dictum applies to determinations concerning
         Congress' authority over the courts-martial of servicemen for crimes committed while they
         were servicemen. Yet the Court in Toth v. Quarles was addressing only the question whether
         an ex-serviceman may be tried by court-martial for crimes committed while serving in the
         Air Force. Thus, the dictum may be also interpreted as limited to that context.</p>

         91 (statement of Brig. Gen. Enoch Crowder). </p>
      <p>George Washington also seems to have held this view. When informed of the decision of a
         military court that a complaint by a civilian against a member of the military should be
         redressed only in a civilian court, he stated in a General Order dated February 24,
         1779:</p>
      <p>"All improper treatment of an inhabitant by an officer or soldier being destructive of good
         order and discipline as well as subversive of the rights of society is as much a breach of
         military, as civil law and as punishable by the one as the other." 14 Writings of George
         Washington 140-141 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 1936).</p>
      <p>[11] The history of court-martial jurisdiction after the adoption of the Constitution also
         provides little support for O'Callahan. For example, in 1800, Congress enacted Articles for
         the Better Government of the Navy, which provided that "[a]ll offences committed by persons
         belonging to the navy while on the shore, shall be punished in the same manner as if they
         had been committed at sea." Act of Apr. 23, 1800, ch. 33, Art. XVII, 2 Stat. 47. Among the
         offenses punishable if committed at sea were murder, embezzlement, and theft. In addition,
         the Act also provided that "[i]f any person in the navy shall, when on shore, plunder,
         abuse, or maltreat any inhabitant, or injure his property in any way, he shall suffer such
         punishment as a court martial shall adjudge." Art. XXVII, 2 Stat. 48. This broad grant of
         jurisdiction to naval courts-martial would suggest that limitations on the power of other
         military tribunals during this period were the result of legislative choice rather than
         want of constitutional power.</p>
      <p>[12] See, e. g., O'Callahan, 395 U. S., at 277 (Harlan, J., dissenting); 1 W. Crosskey,
         Politics and the Constitution 413-414, 424-426 (1953) (hereinafter Crosskey); Comment 718;
         but cf. Horbaly 45-56. </p>
      <p>The only other basis for saying that the Framers intended the words of Art. I, § 8, cl. 14,
         to be narrowly construed is the suggestion that the Framers "could hardly have been unaware
         of Blackstone's strong condemnation of criminal justice administered under military
         procedures." Duke &amp;amp; Vogel 449. In his Commentaries, Blackstone wrote:</p>
      <p>"When the nation was engaged in war . . . more rigorous methods were put in use for the
         raising of armies and the due regulation and discipline of the soldiery: which are to be
         looked upon only as temporary excrescences bred out of the distemper of the state, and not
         as any part of the permanent and perpetual laws of the kingdom. For martial law, which is
         built on no settled principles, but is entirely arbitrary in it's [sic] decisions, is . . .
         something indulged in rather than allowed as a law. The necessity of order and discipline
         in an army is the only thing which can give it countenance; and therefore it ought not to
         be permitted in time of peace, when the king's courts are open to all persons to receive
         justice according to the laws of the land." 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *413.</p>
      <p>Although we do not doubt that Blackstone's views on military law were known to the Framers,
         see Crosskey 411-412, 424-425, we are not persuaded that their relevance is sufficiently
         compelling to overcome the unqualified language of Art. I, § 8, cl. 14.</p>

      <p>[16] See Cooper 172-182; Tomes 13-31.</p>
      <p>[17] Seven years after United States v. Beeker, the Court of Military Appeals expressly
         renounced that decision, holding that O'Callahan and Relford mandated the conclusion that
         off-base drug offenses by a serviceman could not be tried by court-martial. See United
         States v. McCarthy, supra; United States v. Williams, 2 M. J. 81, 82 (Ct. Mil. App. 1976);
         see also United States v. Conn, 6 M. J. 351, 353 (Ct. Mil. App. 1979); United States v.
         Alef, supra, at 415-418. Reversing its position again in 1980, the Court of Military
         Appeals decided that such a restrictive approach was not required under this Court's
         decisions. United States v. Trottier, 9 M. J. 337, 340-351 (1980). The court therefore held
         that "the gravity and immediacy of the threat to military personnel and installations posed
         by the drug traffic and . . . abuse convince us that very few drug involvements of a
         service person will not be `service connected.' " Id., at 351. </p>
      <p>United States v. Trottier, however, has not settled the confusion in this area. In
         Trottier, the court identified the following exception to its general rule: "[I]t would not
         appear that use of marijuana by a serviceperson on a lengthy period of leave away from the
         military community would have such an effect on the military as to warrant the invocation
         of a claim of special military interest and significance adequate to support court-martial
         jurisdiction under O'Callahan." Id., at 350, n. 28. Since Trottier, at least two lower
         military court decisions have found court-martial jurisdiction over offenses arguably
         falling within this exception. See United States v. Lange, 11 M. J. 884 (A. F. C. M. R.
         1981), review denied, 12 M. J. 318 (Ct. Mil. App. 1981) (off-post use of marijuana during
         6-day leave held sufficient to establish service connection); United States v. Brace, 11 M.
         J. 794 (A. F. C. M. R.), review denied, 12 M. J. 109 (Ct. Mil. App. 1981) (off-post use of
         marijuana during 6-day leave 275 miles from post held sufficient to establish service
         connection); see also Horbaly 534-535.</p>
      <p>[18] Petitioner argues that the Court of Military Appeals' decision should be reversed
         because it applies a more expansive subject-matter jurisdiction test to him than had
         previously been announced. According to petitioner, the exercise of court-martial
         jurisdiction over him violates his rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth
         Amendment. Our review of the record in this case, however, reveals that petitioner did not
         raise his due process claim in the Court of Military Appeals. The Court of Military Review,
         which reinstated the Alaska charges against petitioner, held that military courts had
         jurisdiction over petitioner's Alaska offenses. Petitioner therefore had an opportunity to
         raise his due process challenge in the proceedings before the Court of Military Appeals. He
         has not offered any explanation for his failure to do so. In fact, petitioner, in his reply
         brief and at oral argument, did not contest the Government's suggestion that he inexcusably
         failed to raise his due process claim earlier in the proceedings. See Reply Brief for
         Petitioner 16-19; Tr. of Oral Arg. 36-39. We therefore decline to consider the claim. See,
         e. g., Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 443 (1984); Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. August, 450
         U. S. 346, 362 (1981); United States v. Lovasco, 431 U. S. 783, 788, n. 7 (1977).</p>
      <p>[*] Even in its brief proposing the reconsideration of O'Callahan, the United States asked
         the Court to reconsider that decision only in the event that the Court disagrees with the
         United States' submission that petitioner's acts of sexual assaults on military dependents
         are service related. Brief for United States 28.</p>
      <p>[1] In any criminal proceeding brought against petitioner by the State of Alaska, the
         federal grand jury right would not attach; the Sixth Amendment right would apply by virtue
         of the Fourteenth Amendment. Whether petitioner would have these rights in any prosecution
         by a dual sovereign is not at issue here, however. The sole question is whether the Federal
         Government, when it proceeded against petitioner, was obliged to provide those safeguards
         guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. See Grafton v. United States, 206 U. S. 333,
         352-354 (1907).</p>
      <p>[2] The language of this exception could be understood to mean that "cases arising in the
         land or naval forces," as well as in the militia, are only excepted from the requirement of
         grand jury indictment or presentment "in actual service in time of War or public danger."
         This Court, however, has interpreted the "time of war" provision as referring only to cases
         arising in the militia, not the land or naval forces. Johnson v. Sayre, 158 U. S. 109, 114
         (1895). I am not convinced this reading of the Fifth Amendment is correct, but need not
         rely on a different interpretation here.</p>
      <p>[3] "This Court has constantly reiterated that the language of the Constitution where clear
         and unambiguous must be given its plain evident meaning." Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 8,
         n. 7 (1957) (plurality opinion).</p>

         (1971); Gosa v. Mayden, 413 U. S. 665, 672-673 (1973). </p>
      <p>The majority contends that, before O'Callahan, this Court had held consistently that status
         as a member of the Armed Forces was an adequate basis for the assertion of court-martial
         jurisdiction. Ante, at 439. But a number of the precedents cited dealt with the assertion
         of court-martial jurisdiction over individuals who were not members of the Armed Forces and
         therefore, this Court ruled, did not come within the reach of Art. I, § 8, cl. 14. See
         Kinsella v. United States ex rel. Singleton, 361 U. S. 234, 246-248 (1960) (military
         dependent in noncapital case); Reid v. Covert, supra, at 19-23 (plurality opinion)
         (military dependent in capital case); United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11,
         14-15 (1955) (discharged veteran); see also Grisham v. Hagan, 361 U. S. 278 (1960)
         (civilian military employee in capital case); McElroy v. United States ex rel. Guagliardo,
         361 U. S. 281, 286 (1960) (civilian military employee in noncapital case). Having disposed
         of these cases on the threshold issue of the reach of the congressional power created by
         Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, the Court did not consider the limits imposed on the Article I power
         by the Fifth Amendment.</p>
      <p>Several of the remaining cases cited involved crimes committed in the course of the
         performance of military duties that therefore clearly arose in the Armed Forces. See
         Grafton v. United States, supra (murder by Army private serving sentry duty on post);
         Johnson v. Sayre, supra (embezzlement of United States funds intended for the Naval
         service); Smith v. Whitney, 116 U. S. 167 (1886) (fraud on Navy contracts). In Smith, the
         Court concluded that "such conduct of a naval officer is a case arising in the naval
         forces, and therefore punishable by court martial under the articles and regulations made
         or approved by Congress in the exercise of the powers conferred upon it by the
         Constitution, to provide and maintain a navy, and to make rules for the government and
         regulation of the land and naval forces, without indictment or trial by jury." Id., at
         186.</p>
      <p>The remaining cases cited by the majority are similarly inapposite. Coleman v. Tennessee,
         97 U. S. 509 (1879), dealt with a murder committed by a soldier in time of war. In Ex parte
         Milligan, <span class="citation no-link">
            <span class="volume">4</span>
            <span class="reporter">Wall.</span>
            <span class="page">2</span>
         </span> (1867), any reference to the reach of court-martial jurisdiction over persons in
         the Armed Services was dictum, since the holding of that case was that a civilian was
         improperly subjected to military jurisdiction during the Civil War in a State which had
         "upheld the authority of the government, and where the courts are open and their process
         unobstructed." Id., at 121.</p>
      <p>[5] This attitude is evident in the Petition of Right in 1627, in which the two Houses of
         Parliament joined in a petition to the Crown to redress four major grievances, the last of
         which was the trial of soldiers by military commissions. See J. Tanner, English
         Constitutional Conflicts of the Seventeenth Century 61-62 (1983 reprint). The pertinent
         portion of the Petition stated: </p>
      <p>"VII. [W]hereas no offender of what kind soever is exempted from the proceedings to be
         used, and punishments to be inflicted by the laws and statutes of this your realm:
         nevertheless of late time divers commissions. . . have issued forth . . . according to the
         justice of martial law, against such soldiers or mariners, or other dissolute persons
         joining with them, as should commit any murder, robbery, felony, mutiny or other outrage or
         misdemeanor whatsoever; and by such summary course and order as is agreeable to martial
         law, and as is used in armies in time of war, to proceed to the trial and condemnation of
         such offenders, and them to cause to be executed and put to death according to the law
         martial:</p>
      <p>"VIII. By pretext whereof some of your Majesty's subjects have been by some of the said
         Commissioners put to death, when and where, if by the laws and statutes of the land they
         had deserved death, by the same laws and statutes also they might, and by no other ought to
         have been judged and executed." 3 Car. I, ch. 1.</p>
      <p>The petition, which prayed revocation of the military commissions, ultimately received
         royal assent. Tanner, supra, at 64.</p>
      <p>The Mutiny Act of 1689, 1 Wm. &amp;amp; Mary, ch. 5, went further, providing that "no man
         may be forejudged of Life or Limb, or subjected to any kind of Punishment by Martial Law,
         or in any other manner then by the Judgment of his Peers, and according to the known and
         established Laws of this Realm," limiting this provision only with respect to "Soldiers who
         shall Mutiny or Stir up Sedition, or shall Defect Their Majesties Service," who might "be
         brought to a more exemplary and speedy punishment than the usual forms of Law will
         allow."</p>
      <p>[6] See also G. Davis, Military Law of the United States 437 (3d rev. ed. 1915) ("The acts
         of trespass, etc., indicated in this Article are made punishable as special breaches of
         discipline, and less for the protection of citizens than for the maintenance of the orderly
         behavior and morale of the military force") (emphasis omitted); 2 W. Winthrop, Military Law
         and Precedents 1022 (1896) ("This Article, which, dating from an early period of the
         British law, first appeared in our code in the Articles of 1776, is designed, by making
         severely punishable trespasses committed by soldiers on the march or otherwise, to prevent
         straggling and maintain order and discipline in military commands, while at the same time
         availing to secure from intrusion and injury the premises and property of the inhabitants")
         (footnotes omitted).</p>
      <p>[7] But cf. Cong. Globe, 37th Cong., 3d Sess., 953 (1863). </p>
      <p>The Court contends that "American military records reflect trials by court-martial during
         the late 18th century for offenses against civilians and punishable under the civil law,
         such as theft and assault." Ante, at 444. It apparently bases this conclusion on materials
         provided to the O'Callahan Court by the United States. See Brief for United States in
         O'Callahan v. Parker, O. T. 1968, No. 646, pp. 35-52, summarizing courts-martial during the
         period from 1775 to 1815 involving "apparently non-military criminal offenses committed by
         military personnel." Id., at 35. I agree with the O'Callahan Court that, to the extent the
         courts-martial described there did not appear to deal with crimes that were committed
         during war-time, were committed by officers, or involved special military interests, the
         descriptions of the crimes "simply recite the offender and the offense and give no basis
         for judging the relationship of the offense to military discipline." O'Callahan v. Parker,
         395 U. S. 258, 270, n. 14 (1969).</p>
      <p>[8] See also 21 M. J. 512, 514 (C. G. C. M. R. 1985) ("A friendship had grown between the
         accused and both of the other families, grounded in one case, on the common sporting
         interests of bowling and basketball, and, in the other, on the proximity of living next
         door. The alleged victims came to the accused's home on a regular basis to visit with his
         two sons. Both girls at one time played on a soccer team coached by the accused and they
         also bowled in a league in which the accused was active").</p>
      <p>[9] See the military judge's Supplemental Essential Findings of Fact, App. to Pet. for
         Cert. 62a ("To the extent that trust had a bearing on the opportunity for the alleged
         offenses, that trust arose out of friendships between the Solorio and Johnson and Solorio
         and Grantz families and not out of the respective fathers [sic] common association as
         members of the U. S. Coast Guard. The trust placed in a servicemember in general, and in
         the accused in particular, by virtue of status as a member of the Coast Guard was minimal
         and had no direct relationship to the offenses alleged").</p>
      <p>[10] The appeal to the Court of Military Review was brought under Article 62, Uniform Code
         of Military Justice, 10 U. S. C. § 862 (1982 ed., Supp. III). Section 862(b) provides that
         "[i]n ruling on an appeal under this section, the Court of Military Review may act only
         with respect to matters of law, notwithstanding section 866(c) of this title (article
         66(c))." Title 10 U. S. C. 866(c), Article 66(c) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice,
         authorizes the Court of Military Review, in acting on findings of guilty and sentences, to
         "weigh the evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses, and determine controverted
         questions of fact." See also United States v. Burris, 21 M. J. 140, 143-144 (Ct. Mil. App.
         1985). </p>
      <p>While the Court of Military Review acknowledged that it was bound by facts found at the
         trial level unless those findings were incorrect as a matter of law, 21 M. J., at 515, 517,
         it nonetheless proceeded to assume the facts necessary to its conclusion that the impact on
         the Coast Guard community at Governors Island created the requisite service connection to
         justify the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction. One judge on the Court of Military
         Review, dissenting in part from the court's ruling, rejected the majority's approach:</p>
      <p>"Where I depart from the majority is the holding that there was `service connection' and
         therefore jurisdiction, in this case, as a matter of law. . . . [T]he [military] judge made
         no specific findings with respect to the possible effect of the offenses at Governors
         Island or on personnel under the authority and responsibility of the convening authority.
         Even if this case were before us for review under Article 66(c), U. C. M. J., 10 U. S. C. §
         666(c), I would hesitate to determine that jurisdiction exists in light of this omission..
         . . Since this case is before us for review under Article 62(b) U. C. M. J., 10 U. S. C. §
         862(b), I do not believe we are empowered to cure an omission from the essential findings
         of the trial judge." Id., at 523 (Bridgman, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
         part).</p>
      <p>Judge Bridgman would have remanded without prejudice to the accused's right to renew his
         attack on the jurisdiction of the court-martial. Ibid.</p>
      <p>The Court of Military Appeals suggested broadly that the Court of Military Review had
         violated its obligations under Article 62 in this case, but concluded that the violation
         was immaterial. See 21 M. J. 251, 254 (1986) ("A military judge's factfinding power under
         Article 62 cannot be superseded by a Court of Military Review in an appeal under Article 62
         . . . . To some extent the Court of Military Review may have erred in this direction; but
         any such error is immaterial, because on the basis of indisputed facts, we conclude that
         the offenses in Alaska were service-connected").</p>
