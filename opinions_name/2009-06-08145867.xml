      </div><div type="" judge=""><p>Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
      <p>In this case the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia reversed a trial court judgment,
         which had entered a jury verdict of $50 million. Five justices heard the case, and the vote
         to reverse was 3 to 2. The question presented is whether the Due Process Clause of the
         Fourteenth Amendment was violated when one of the justices in the majority denied a recusal
         motion. The basis for the motion was that the justice had received campaign contributions
         in an extraordinary amount from, and through the efforts of, the board chairman <span
            class="star-pagination">*2257</span> and principal officer of the corporation found
         liable for the damages.</p>
      <p>Under our precedents there are objective standards that require recusal when "the
         probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be
         constitutionally tolerable." Withrow v. Larkin, <span class="citation">

         </span>, 47, 95 S.Ct. 1456, 43 L.Ed.2d 712 (1975). Applying those precedents, we find that,
         in all the circumstances of this case, due process requires recusal.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>I</h2>
      <p>In August 2002 a West Virginia jury returned a verdict that found respondents A.T. Massey
         Coal Co. and its affiliates (hereinafter Massey) liable for fraudulent misrepresentation,
         concealment, and tortious interference with existing contractual relations. The jury
         awarded petitioners Hugh Caperton, Harman Development Corp., Harman Mining Corp., and
         Sovereign Coal Sales (hereinafter Caperton) the sum of $50 million in compensatory and
         punitive damages.</p>
      <p>In June 2004 the state trial court denied Massey's post-trial motions challenging the
         verdict and the damages award, finding that Massey "intentionally acted in utter disregard
         of [Caperton's] rights and ultimately destroyed [Caperton's] businesses because, after
         conducting cost-benefit analyses, [Massey] concluded it was in its financial interest to do
         so." App. 32a, ¶ 10(p). In March 2005 the trial court denied Massey's motion for judgment
         as a matter of law.</p>
      <p>Don Blankenship is Massey's chairman, chief executive officer, and president. After the
         verdict but before the appeal, West Virginia held its 2004 judicial elections. Knowing the
         Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia would consider the appeal in the case,
         Blankenship decided to support an attorney who sought to replace Justice McGraw. Justice
         McGraw was a candidate for reelection to that court. The attorney who sought to replace him
         was Brent Benjamin.</p>
      <p>In addition to contributing the $1,000 statutory maximum to Benjamin's campaign committee,
         Blankenship donated almost $2.5 million to "And For The Sake Of The Kids," a political
         organization formed under 26 U.S.C. § 527. The § 527 organization opposed McGraw and
         supported Benjamin. App. 672a-673a. Blankenship's donations accounted for more than
         two-thirds of the total funds it raised. Id., at 150a. This was not all. Blankenship spent,
         in addition, just over $500,000 on independent expenditures&#x97;for direct mailings and
         letters soliciting donations as well as television and newspaper advertisements &#x97;"`to
         support ... Brent Benjamin.'" Id., at 184a, 186a, 200a (bold typeface omitted) (quoting
         Blankenship's state campaign financial disclosure filings).</p>
      <p>To provide some perspective, Blankenship's $3 million in contributions were more than the
         total amount spent by all other Benjamin supporters and three times the amount spent by
         Benjamin's own committee. Id., at 288a. Caperton contends that Blankenship spent $1 million
         more than the total amount spent by the campaign committees of both candidates combined.
         Brief for Petitioners 28.</p>
      <p>Benjamin won. He received 382,036 votes (53.3%), and McGraw received 334,-301 votes
         (46.7%). App. 677a.</p>
      <p>In October 2005, before Massey filed its petition for appeal in West Virginia's highest
         court, Caperton moved to disqualify now-Justice Benjamin under the Due Process Clause and
         the West Virginia Code of Judicial Conduct, based on the conflict caused by Blankenship's
         campaign involvement. Justice Benjamin denied the motion in April 2006. He indicated that
         he <span class="star-pagination">*2258</span> "carefully considered the bases and
         accompanying exhibits proffered by the movants." But he found "no objective information...
         to show that this Justice has a bias for or against any litigant, that this Justice has
         prejudged the matters which comprise this litigation, or that this Justice will be anything
         but fair and impartial." Id., at 336a-337a. In December 2006 Massey filed its petition for
         appeal to challenge the adverse jury verdict. The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals
         granted review.</p>
      <p>In November 2007 that court reversed the $50 million verdict against Massey. The majority
         opinion, authored by then-Chief Justice Davis and joined by Justices Benjamin and Maynard,
         found that "Massey's conduct warranted the type of judgment rendered in this case." Id., at
         357a. It reversed, nevertheless, based on two independent grounds&#x97;first, that a
         forum-selection clause contained in a contract to which Massey was not a party barred the
         suit in West Virginia, and, second, that res judicata barred the suit due to an
         out-of-state judgment to which Massey was not a party. Id., at 345a. Justice Starcher
         dissented, stating that the "majority's opinion is morally and legally wrong." Id., at
         420a-422a. Justice Albright also dissented, accusing the majority of "misapplying the law
         and introducing sweeping `new law' into our jurisprudence that may well come back to haunt
         us." Id., at 430a-431a.</p>
      <p>Caperton sought rehearing, and the parties moved for disqualification of three of the five
         justices who decided the appeal. Photos had surfaced of Justice Maynard vacationing with
         Blankenship in the French Riviera while the case was pending. Id., at 440a-441a, 456a.
         Justice Maynard granted Caperton's recusal motion. On the other side Justice Starcher
         granted Massey's recusal motion, apparently based on his public criticism of Blankenship's
         role in the 2004 elections. In his recusal memorandum Justice Starcher urged Justice
         Benjamin to recuse himself as well. He noted that "Blankenship's bestowal of his personal
         wealth, political tactics, and `friendship' have created a cancer in the affairs of this
         Court." Id., at 459a-460a. Justice Benjamin declined Justice Starcher's suggestion and
         denied Caperton's recusal motion.</p>
      <p>The court granted rehearing. Justice Benjamin, now in the capacity of acting chief justice,
         selected Judges Cookman and Fox to replace the recused justices. Caperton moved a third
         time for disqualification, arguing that Justice Benjamin had failed to apply the correct
         standard under West Virginia law&#x97;i.e., whether "a reasonable and prudent person,
         knowing these objective facts, would harbor doubts about Justice Benjamin's ability to be
         fair and impartial." Id., at 466a, ¶ 8. Caperton also included the results of a public
         opinion poll, which indicated that over 67% of West Virginians doubted Justice Benjamin
         would be fair and impartial. Justice Benjamin again refused to withdraw, noting that the
         "push poll" was "neither credible nor sufficiently reliable to serve as the basis for an
         elected judge's disqualification." Id., at 483a.</p>
      <p>In April 2008 a divided court again reversed the jury verdict, and again it was a 3-to-2
         decision. Justice Davis filed a modified version of his prior opinion, repeating the two
         earlier holdings. She was joined by Justice Benjamin and Judge Fox. Justice Albright,
         joined by Judge Cookman, dissented: "Not only is the majority opinion unsupported by the
         facts and existing case law, but it is also fundamentally unfair. Sadly, justice was
         neither honored nor served by the majority." ___ W.Va. ___, ___, ___ S.E.2d ___, ___, 2008
         WL 918444; App. 633a. The dissent also noted "genuine due process <span
            class="star-pagination">*2259</span> implications arising under federal law" with
         respect to Justice Benjamin's failure to recuse himself. ___ W.Va., at ___, n. 16, ___

      <p>Four months later&#x97;a month after the petition for writ of certiorari was filed in this
         Court&#x97;Justice Benjamin filed a concurring opinion. He defended the merits of the
         majority opinion as well as his decision not to recuse. He rejected Caperton's challenge to
         his participation in the case under both the Due Process Clause and West Virginia law.
         Justice Benjamin reiterated that he had no "`direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary

         `appearances,'" he concluded, "seems little more than an invitation to subject West
         Virginia's justice system to the vagaries of the day&#x97;a framework in which
         predictability and stability yield to supposition, innuendo, half-truths, and partisan

      <h2>II</h2>
      <p>It is axiomatic that "[a] fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due
         process." Murchison, supra, at 136, 75 S.Ct. 623. As the Court has recognized, however,
         "most matters relating to judicial disqualification [do] not rise to a constitutional
         level." FTC v. Cement Institute, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/x5q/ftc-v-cement-institute/">
               <span class="volume">333</span>
               <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
               <span class="page">683</span>
            </a>
         </span>, 702, 68 S.Ct. 793, 92 L.Ed. 1010 (1948). The early and leading case on the subject
         is Tumey v. Ohio, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/w2V/tumey-v-ohio/">
               <span class="volume">273</span>
               <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
               <span class="page">510</span>
            </a>
         </span>, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749 (1927). There, the Court stated that "matters of
         kinship, personal bias, state policy, remoteness of interest, would seem generally to be
         matters merely of legislative discretion." Id., at 523, 47 S.Ct. 437.</p>
      <p>The Tumey Court concluded that the Due Process Clause incorporated the common-law rule that
         a judge must recuse himself when he has "a direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary
         interest" in a case. Ibid. This rule reflects the maxim that "[n]o man is allowed to be a
         judge in his own cause; because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not
         improbably, corrupt his integrity." The Federalist No. 10, p. 59 (J. Cooke ed.1961) (J.
         Madison); see Frank, Disqualification of Judges, 56 Yale L.J. 605, 611-612 (1947) (same).
         Under this rule, "disqualification for bias or prejudice was not permitted"; those matters
         were left to statutes and judicial codes. Lavoie, supra, at 820, 106 S.Ct. 1580; see also
         Part IV, infra (discussing judicial codes). Personal bias or prejudice "alone would not be
         sufficient basis for imposing a constitutional requirement under the Due Process Clause."
         Lavoie, supra, at 820, 106 S.Ct. 1580.</p>
      <p>As new problems have emerged that were not discussed at common law, however, the Court has
         identified additional instances which, as an objective matter, require recusal. These are
         circumstances "in which experience teaches that the probability of actual bias on the part
         of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable." Withrow, 421
         U.S., at 47, 95 S.Ct. 1456. To place the present case in proper context, two instances
         where the Court has required recusal merit further discussion.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>A</h2>
      <p>The first involved the emergence of local tribunals where a judge had a financial <span
            class="star-pagination">*2260</span> interest in the outcome of a case, although the
         interest was less than what would have been considered personal or direct at common
         law.</p>
      <p>This was the problem addressed in Tumey. There, the mayor of a village had the authority to
         sit as a judge (with no jury) to try those accused of violating a state law prohibiting the
         possession of alcoholic beverages. Inherent in this structure were two potential conflicts.
         First, the mayor received a salary supplement for performing judicial duties, and the funds
         for that compensation derived from the fines assessed in a case. No fines were assessed
         upon acquittal. The mayor-judge thus received a salary supplement only if he convicted the
         defendant. 273 U.S., at 520, 47 S.Ct. 437. Second, sums from the criminal fines were
         deposited to the village's general treasury fund for village improvements and repairs. Id.,
         at 522, 47 S.Ct. 437.</p>
      <p>The Court held that the Due Process Clause required disqualification "both because of [the
         mayor-judge's] direct pecuniary interest in the outcome, and because of his official motive
         to convict and to graduate the fine to help the financial needs of the village." Id., at
         535, 47 S.Ct. 437. It so held despite observing that "[t]here are doubtless mayors who
         would not allow such a consideration as $12 costs in each case to affect their judgment in
         it." Id., at 532, 47 S.Ct. 437. The Court articulated the controlling principle:</p> "Every
      procedure which would offer a possible temptation to the average man as a judge to forget the
      burden of proof required to convict the defendant, or which might lead him not to hold the
      balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused, denies the latter due process
      of law." Ibid. <p>The Court was thus concerned with more than the traditional common-law
         prohibition on direct pecuniary interest. It was also concerned with a more general concept
         of interests that tempt adjudicators to disregard neutrality.</p>
      <p>This concern with conflicts resulting from financial incentives was elaborated in Ward v.
         Monroeville, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/yhV/ward-v-monroeville/">
               <span class="volume">409</span>
               <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
               <span class="page">57</span>
            </a>
         </span>, 93 S.Ct. 80, 34 L.Ed.2d 267 (1972), which invalidated a conviction in another
         mayor's court. In Monroeville, unlike in Tumey, the mayor received no money; instead, the
         fines the mayor assessed went to the town's general fisc. The Court held that "[t]he fact
         that the mayor [in Tumey] shared directly in the fees and costs did not define the limits
         of the principle." 409 U.S., at 60, 93 S.Ct. 80. The principle, instead, turned on the
         "`possible temptation'" the mayor might face; the mayor's "executive responsibilities for
         village finances may make him partisan to maintain the high level of contribution [to those
         finances] from the mayor's court." Ibid. As the Court reiterated in another case that Term,
         "the [judge's] financial stake need not be as direct or positive as it appeared to be in
         Tumey." Gibson v. Berryhill, <span class="citation">

         preside over a hearing against competing optometrists).</p>
      <p>The Court in Lavoie further clarified the reach of the Due Process Clause regarding a
         judge's financial interest in a case. There, a justice had cast the deciding vote on the
         Alabama Supreme Court to uphold a punitive damages award against an insurance company for
         bad-faith refusal to pay a claim. At the time of his vote, the justice was the lead
         plaintiff in a nearly identical lawsuit pending in Alabama's lower courts. His deciding
         vote, this Court surmised, "undoubtedly `raised the stakes'" for the insurance defendant in
         the <span class="star-pagination">*2261</span> justice's suit. 475 U.S., at 823-824, 106
         S.Ct. 1580.</p>
      <p>The Court stressed that it was "not required to decide whether in fact [the justice] was
         influenced." Id., at 825, 106 S.Ct. 1580. The proper constitutional inquiry is "whether
         sitting on the case then before the Supreme Court of Alabama `"would offer a possible
         temptation to the average ... judge to ... lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and
         true."'" Ibid. (quoting Monroeville, supra, at 60, 93 S.Ct. 80, in turn quoting Tumey,
         supra, at 532, 47 S.Ct. 437). The Court underscored that "what degree or kind of interest
         is sufficient to disqualify a judge from sitting `cannot be defined with precision.'" 475
         U.S., at 822, 106 S.Ct. 1580 (quoting Murchison, 349 U.S., at 136, 75 S.Ct. 623). In the
         Court's view, however, it was important that the test have an objective component.</p>
      <p>The Lavoie Court proceeded to distinguish the state court justice's particular interest in
         the case, which required recusal, from interests that were not a constitutional concern.
         For instance, "while [the other] justices might conceivably have had a slight pecuniary
         interest" due to their potential membership in a class-action suit against their own
         insurance companies, that interest is "`too remote and insubstantial to violate the
         constitutional constraints.'" 475 U.S., at 825-826, 106 S.Ct. 1580 (quoting Marshall v.
         Jerrico, Inc., <span class="citation">

      <p/>
      <h2>B</h2>
      <p>The second instance requiring recusal that was not discussed at common law emerged in the
         criminal contempt context, where a judge had no pecuniary interest in the case but was
         challenged because of a conflict arising from his participation in an earlier proceeding.
         This Court characterized that first proceeding (perhaps pejoratively) as a "`one-man grand
         jury.'" Murchison, 349 U.S., at 133, 75 S.Ct. 623.</p>
      <p>In that first proceeding, and as provided by state law, a judge examined witnesses to
         determine whether criminal charges should be brought. The judge called the two petitioners
         before him. One petitioner answered questions, but the judge found him untruthful and
         charged him with perjury. The second declined to answer on the ground that he did not have
         counsel with him, as state law seemed to permit. The judge charged him with contempt. The
         judge proceeded to try and convict both petitioners. Id., at 134-135, 75 S.Ct. 623.</p>
      <p>This Court set aside the convictions on grounds that the judge had a conflict of interest
         at the trial stage because of his earlier participation followed by his decision to charge
         them. The Due Process Clause required disqualification. The Court recited the general rule
         that "no man can be a judge in his own case," adding that "no man is permitted to try cases
         where he has an interest in the outcome." Id., at 136, 75 S.Ct. 623. It noted that the
         disqualifying criteria "cannot be defined with precision. Circumstances and relationships
         must be considered." Ibid. These circumstances and the prior relationship required recusal:
         "Having been a part of [the one-man grand jury] process a judge cannot be, in the very
         nature of things, wholly disinterested in the conviction or acquittal of those accused."
         Id., at 137, 75 S.Ct. 623. That is because "[a]s a practical matter it is difficult if not
         impossible for a judge to free himself from the influence of what took place in his
         `grand-jury' secret session." Id., at 138, 75 S.Ct. 623.</p>
      <p>The Murchison Court was careful to distinguish the circumstances and the relationship from
         those where the Constitution <span class="star-pagination">*2262</span> would not require
         recusal. It noted that the single-judge grand jury is "more a part of the accusatory
         process than an ordinary lay grand juror," and that "adjudication by a trial judge of a
         contempt committed in [a judge's] presence in open court cannot be likened to the
         proceedings here." Id., at 137, 75 S.Ct. 623. The judge's prior relationship with the
         defendant, as well as the information acquired from the prior proceeding, was of critical
         import.</p>
      <p>Following Murchison the Court held in Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/yb5/mayberry-v-pennsylvania/">
               <span class="volume">400</span>
               <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
               <span class="page">455</span>
            </a>
         </span>, 466, 91 S.Ct. 499, 27 L.Ed.2d 532 (1971), "that by reason of the Due Process
         Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment a defendant in criminal contempt proceedings should be
         given a public trial before a judge other than the one reviled by the contemnor." The Court
         reiterated that this rule rests on the relationship between the judge and the defendant:
         "[A] judge, vilified as was this Pennsylvania judge, necessarily becomes embroiled in a
         running, bitter controversy. No one so cruelly slandered is likely to maintain that calm
         detachment necessary for fair adjudication." Id., at 465, 91 S.Ct. 499.</p>
      <p>Again, the Court considered the specific circumstances presented by the case. It noted that
         "not every attack on a judge ... disqualifies him from sitting." Ibid. The Court
         distinguished the case from Ungar v. Sarafite, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/xK9/ungar-v-sarafite/">

            </a>
         </span>, 84 S.Ct. 841, 11 L.Ed.2d 921 (1964), in which the Court had "ruled that a lawyer's
         challenge, though `disruptive, recalcitrant and disagreeable commentary,' was still not `an
         insulting attack upon the integrity of the judge carrying such potential for bias as to
         require disqualification.'" Mayberry, supra, at 465-466, 91 S.Ct. 499 (quoting Ungar,
         supra, at 584, 84 S.Ct. 841). The inquiry is an objective one. The Court asks not whether
         the judge is actually, subjectively biased, but whether the average judge in his position
         is "likely" to be neutral, or whether there is an unconstitutional "potential for
         bias."</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>III</h2>
      <p>Based on the principles described in these cases we turn to the issue before us. This
         problem arises in the context of judicial elections, a framework not presented in the
         precedents we have reviewed and discussed.</p>
      <p>Caperton contends that Blankenship's pivotal role in getting Justice Benjamin elected
         created a constitutionally intolerable probability of actual bias. Though not a bribe or
         criminal influence, Justice Benjamin would nevertheless feel a debt of gratitude to
         Blankenship for his extraordinary efforts to get him elected. That temptation, Caperton
         claims, is as strong and inherent in human nature as was the conflict the Court confronted
         in Tumey and Monroeville when a mayor-judge (or the city) benefited financially from a
         defendant's conviction, as well as the conflict identified in Murchison and Mayberry when a
         judge was the object of a defendant's contempt.</p>
      <p>Justice Benjamin was careful to address the recusal motions and explain his reasons why, on
         his view of the controlling standard, disqualification was not in order. In four separate
         opinions issued during the course of the appeal, he explained why no actual bias had been
         established. He found no basis for recusal because Caperton failed to provide "objective
         evidence" or "objective information," but merely "subjective belief" of bias. ___ W.Va., at
         ___, ___-___, ___ S.E.2d, at ___, ___-___, 2008 WL 918444; App. 336a, 337a-338a, 444a-445a.
         Nor could anyone "point to any actual conduct or activity on [his] part which could be
         termed `improper.'" ___ W.Va., at ___-___, ___ S.E.2d, at ___-___, 2008 WL 918444; <span
            class="star-pagination">*2263</span> App. 655a-656a. In other words, based on the facts
         presented by Caperton, Justice Benjamin conducted a probing search into his actual motives
         and inclinations; and he found none to be improper. We do not question his subjective
         findings of impartiality and propriety. Nor do we determine whether there was actual
         bias.</p>
      <p>Following accepted principles of our legal tradition respecting the proper performance of
         judicial functions, judges often inquire into their subjective motives and purposes in the
         ordinary course of deciding a case. This does not mean the inquiry is a simple one. "The
         work of deciding cases goes on every day in hundreds of courts throughout the land. Any
         judge, one might suppose, would find it easy to describe the process which he had followed
         a thousand times and more. Nothing could be farther from the truth." B. Cardozo, The Nature
         of the Judicial Process 9 (1921).</p>
      <p>The judge inquires into reasons that seem to be leading to a particular result. Precedent
         and stare decisis and the text and purpose of the law and the Constitution; logic and
         scholarship and experience and common sense; and fairness and disinterest and neutrality
         are among the factors at work. To bring coherence to the process, and to seek respect for
         the resulting judgment, judges often explain the reasons for their conclusions and rulings.
         There are instances when the introspection that often attends this process may reveal that
         what the judge had assumed to be a proper, controlling factor is not the real one at work.
         If the judge discovers that some personal bias or improper consideration seems to be the
         actuating cause of the decision or to be an influence so difficult to dispel that there is
         a real possibility of undermining neutrality, the judge may think it necessary to consider
         withdrawing from the case.</p>
      <p>The difficulties of inquiring into actual bias, and the fact that the inquiry is often a
         private one, simply underscore the need for objective rules. Otherwise there may be no
         adequate protection against a judge who simply misreads or misapprehends the real motives
         at work in deciding the case. The judge's own inquiry into actual bias, then, is not one
         that the law can easily superintend or review, though actual bias, if disclosed, no doubt
         would be grounds for appropriate relief. In lieu of exclusive reliance on that personal
         inquiry, or on appellate review of the judge's determination respecting actual bias, the
         Due Process Clause has been implemented by objective standards that do not require proof of
         actual bias. See Tumey, 273 U.S., at 532, 47 S.Ct. 437; Mayberry, 400 U.S., at 465-466, 91
         S.Ct. 499; Lavoie, 475 U. S., at 825, 106 S.Ct. 1580. In defining these standards the Court
         has asked whether, "under a realistic appraisal of psychological tendencies and human
         weakness," the interest "poses such a risk of actual bias or prejudgment that the practice
         must be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is to be adequately implemented."
         Withrow, 421 U.S., at 47, 95 S.Ct. 1456.</p>
      <p>We turn to the influence at issue in this case. Not every campaign contribution by a
         litigant or attorney creates a probability of bias that requires a judge's recusal, but
         this is an exceptional case. Cf. Mayberry, supra, at 465, 91 S.Ct. 499 ("It is, of course,
         not every attack on a judge that disqualifies him from sitting"); Lavoie, supra, at
         825-826, 106 S.Ct. 1580 (some pecuniary interests are "`too remote and insubstantial'"). We
         conclude that there is a serious risk of actual bias&#x97; based on objective and
         reasonable perceptions&#x97;when a person with a personal stake in a particular case had a
         significant and disproportionate influence in placing <span class="star-pagination"
            >*2264</span> the judge on the case by raising funds or directing the judge's election
         campaign when the case was pending or imminent. The inquiry centers on the contribution's
         relative size in comparison to the total amount of money contributed to the campaign, the
         total amount spent in the election, and the apparent effect such contribution had on the
         outcome of the election.</p>
      <p>Applying this principle, we conclude that Blankenship's campaign efforts had a significant
         and disproportionate influence in placing Justice Benjamin on the case. Blankenship
         contributed some $3 million to unseat the incumbent and replace him with Benjamin. His
         contributions eclipsed the total amount spent by all other Benjamin supporters and exceeded
         by 300% the amount spent by Benjamin's campaign committee. App. 288a. Caperton claims
         Blankenship spent $1 million more than the total amount spent by the campaign committees of
         both candidates combined. Brief for Petitioners 28.</p>
      <p>Massey responds that Blankenship's support, while significant, did not cause Benjamin's
         victory. In the end the people of West Virginia elected him, and they did so based on many
         reasons other than Blankenship's efforts. Massey points out that every major state
         newspaper, but one, endorsed Benjamin. Brief for Respondents 54. It also contends that
         then-Justice McGraw cost himself the election by giving a speech during the campaign, a
         speech the opposition seized upon for its own advantage. Ibid.</p>
      <p>Justice Benjamin raised similar arguments. He asserted that "the outcome of the 2004
         election was due primarily to [his own] campaign's message," as well as McGraw's
         "devastat[ing]" speech in which he "made a number of controversial claims which became a
         matter of statewide discussion in the media, on the internet, and elsewhere." ___ W.Va., at
         ___, and n. 29, ___ S.E.2d, at ___, and n. 29, 2008 WL 918444; App. 673a, 674a, and n. 29;
         see also ___ W.Va., at ___-___, and nn. 35-39, ___ S.E.2d, at ___-___, and nn. 35-39, 2008
         WL 918444; App. 677a-680a, and nn. 35-39.</p>
      <p>Whether Blankenship's campaign contributions were a necessary and sufficient cause of
         Benjamin's victory is not the proper inquiry. Much like determining whether a judge is
         actually biased, proving what ultimately drives the electorate to choose a particular
         candidate is a difficult endeavor, not likely to lend itself to a certain conclusion. This
         is particularly true where, as here, there is no procedure for judicial factfinding and the
         sole trier of fact is the one accused of bias. Due process requires an objective inquiry
         into whether the contributor's influence on the election under all the circumstances "would
         offer a possible temptation to the average ... judge to ... lead him not to hold the
         balance nice, clear and true." Tumey, supra, at 532, 47 S.Ct. 437. In an election decided
         by fewer than 50,000 votes (382,036 to 334,301), see ___ W.Va., at ___, ___ S.E.2d, at ___,
         2008 WL 918444; App. 677a, Blankenship's campaign contributions&#x97;in comparison to the
         total amount contributed to the campaign, as well as the total amount spent in the
         election&#x97;had a significant and disproportionate influence on the electoral outcome.
         And the risk that Blankenship's influence engendered actual bias is sufficiently
         substantial that it "must be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is to be adequately
         implemented." Withrow, supra, at 47, 95 S.Ct. 1456.</p>
      <p>The temporal relationship between the campaign contributions, the justice's election, and
         the pendency of the case is also critical. It was reasonably foreseeable, when the campaign
         contributions were made, that the pending case would be before <span
            class="star-pagination">*2265</span> the newly elected justice. The $50 million adverse
         jury verdict had been entered before the election, and the Supreme Court of Appeals was the
         next step once the state trial court dealt with post-trial motions. So it became at once
         apparent that, absent recusal, Justice Benjamin would review a judgment that cost his
         biggest donor's company $50 million. Although there is no allegation of a quid pro quo
         agreement, the fact remains that Blankenship's extraordinary contributions were made at a
         time when he had a vested stake in the outcome. Just as no man is allowed to be a judge in
         his own cause, similar fears of bias can arise when&#x97;without the consent of the other
         parties&#x97;a man chooses the judge in his own cause. And applying this principle to the
         judicial election process, there was here a serious, objective risk of actual bias that
         required Justice Benjamin's recusal.</p>
      <p>Justice Benjamin did undertake an extensive search for actual bias. But, as we have
         indicated, that is just one step in the judicial process; objective standards may also
         require recusal whether or not actual bias exists or can be proved. Due process "may
         sometimes bar trial by judges who have no actual bias and who would do their very best to
         weigh the scales of justice equally between contending parties." Murchison, 349 U.S., at
         136, 75 S.Ct. 623. The failure to consider objective standards requiring recusal is not
         consistent with the imperatives of due process. We find that Blankenship's significant and
         disproportionate influence&#x97; coupled with the temporal relationship between the
         election and the pending case&#x97; "`"offer a possible temptation to the average... judge
         to ... lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true."'" Lavoie, 475 U.S., at 825,
         106 S.Ct. 1580 (quoting Monroeville, 409 U.S., at 60, 93 S.Ct. 80, in turn quoting Tumey,
         273 U.S., at 532, 47 S.Ct. 437). On these extreme facts the probability of actual bias
         rises to an unconstitutional level.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>IV</h2>
      <p>Our decision today addresses an extraordinary situation where the Constitution requires
         recusal. Massey and its amici predict that various adverse consequences will follow from
         recognizing a constitutional violation here&#x97;ranging from a flood of recusal motions to
         unnecessary interference with judicial elections. We disagree. The facts now before us are
         extreme by any measure. The parties point to no other instance involving judicial campaign
         contributions that presents a potential for bias comparable to the circumstances in this
         case.</p>
      <p>It is true that extreme cases often test the bounds of established legal principles, and
         sometimes no administrable standard may be available to address the perceived wrong. But it
         is also true that extreme cases are more likely to cross constitutional limits, requiring
         this Court's intervention and formulation of objective standards. This is particularly true
         when due process is violated. See, e.g., County of Sacramento v. Lewis, <span
            class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/B9b/countyof-sacramento-v-lewis/">

               <span class="page">833</span>
            </a>
         </span>, 846-847, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998) (reiterating the due-process
         prohibition on "executive abuse of power ... which shocks the conscience"); id., at 858,
         118 S.Ct. 1708 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (explaining that "objective considerations,
         including history and precedent, are the controlling principle" of this due process
         standard).</p>
      <p>This Court's recusal cases are illustrative. In each case the Court dealt with extreme
         facts that created an unconstitutional probability of bias that "`cannot be defined with
         precision.'" Lavoie, 475 U.S., at 822, 106 S.Ct. 1580 (quoting Murchison, 349 U.S., at 136,
         75 S.Ct. 623). Yet the <span class="star-pagination">*2266</span> Court articulated an
         objective standard to protect the parties' basic right to a fair trial in a fair tribunal.
         The Court was careful to distinguish the extreme facts of the cases before it from those
         interests that would not rise to a constitutional level. See, e.g., Lavoie, supra, at
         825-826, 106 S.Ct. 1580; Mayberry, 400 U.S., at 465-466, 91 S.Ct. 499; Murchison, supra, at
         137, 75 S.Ct. 623; see also Part II, supra. In this case we do nothing more than what the
         Court has done before.</p>
      <p>As such, it is worth noting the effects, or lack thereof, of the Court's prior decisions.
         Even though the standards announced in those cases raised questions similar to those that
         might be asked after our decision today, the Court was not flooded with Monroeville or
         Murchison motions. That is perhaps due in part to the extreme facts those standards sought
         to address. Courts proved quite capable of applying the standards to less extreme
         situations.</p>
      <p>One must also take into account the judicial reforms the States have implemented to
         eliminate even the appearance of partiality. Almost every State&#x97;West Virginia

         avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety." ABA Annotated Model Code of Judicial
         Conduct, Canon 2 (2004); see Brief for American Bar Association as Amicus Curiae 14, and n.
         29. The ABA Model Code's test for appearance of impropriety is "whether the conduct would
         create in reasonable minds a perception that the judge's ability to carry out judicial
         responsibilities with integrity, impartiality and competence is impaired." Canon 2A,
         Commentary; see also W. Va.Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2A, and Commentary (2009)
         (same).</p>
      <p>The West Virginia Code of Judicial Conduct also requires a judge to "disqualify himself or
         herself in a proceeding in which the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned."
         Canon 3E(1); see also 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) ("Any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the
         United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might
         reasonably be questioned"). Under Canon 3E(1), "`[t]he question of disqualification focuses
         on whether an objective assessment of the judge's conduct produces a reasonable question
         about impartiality, not on the judge's subjective perception of the ability to act
         fairly.'" State ex rel. Brown v. Dietrick, 191 W.Va. 169, 174, n. 9, <span class="citation">

      <p>The judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia is reversed, and the case is
         remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>
      <p>It is so ordered.</p>
      <p>Chief Justice ROBERTS, with whom Justice SCALIA, Justice THOMAS, and Justice ALITO join,
         dissenting.</p>
      <p>I, of course, share the majority's sincere concerns about the need to maintain a fair,
         independent, and impartial judiciary&#x97;and one that appears to be such. But I fear that
         the Court's decision will undermine rather than promote these values.</p>
      <p>Until today, we have recognized exactly two situations in which the Federal Due Process
         Clause requires disqualification of a judge: when the judge has a financial interest in the
         outcome of the case, and when the judge is trying a defendant for certain criminal
         contempts. Vaguer notions of bias or the appearance of bias were never a basis for
         disqualification, either at common law or under our constitutional precedents. Those issues
         were instead addressed by legislation or court rules.</p>
      <p>Today, however, the Court enlists the Due Process Clause to overturn a judge's failure to
         recuse because of a "probability of bias." Unlike the established grounds for
         disqualification, a "probability of bias" cannot be defined in any limited way. The Court's
         new "rule" provides no guidance to judges and litigants about when recusal will be
         constitutionally required. This will inevitably lead to an increase in allegations that
         judges are biased, however groundless those charges may be. The end result will do far more
         to erode public confidence in judicial impartiality than an isolated failure to recuse in a
         particular case.</p>

         (1941))). We have thus identified only two situations in which the Due Process Clause
         requires disqualification of a judge: when the judge has a financial interest in the
         outcome of the case, and when the judge is presiding over certain types of criminal
         contempt proceedings.</p>
      <p>It is well established that a judge may not preside over a case in which he has a "direct,
         personal, substantial pecuniary interest." Tumey v. Ohio, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/w2V/tumey-v-ohio/">

         </span>, 523, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749 (1927). This principle is relatively
         straightforward, and largely tracks the longstanding common-law rule regarding judicial
         recusal. See Frank, Disqualification of Judges, 56 Yale L.J. 605, 609 (1947) ("The common
         law of disqualification ... was clear and simple: a judge was disqualified for direct
         pecuniary interest and for nothing else"). For example, a defendant's due process rights
         are violated when he is tried before a judge who is "paid for his service only when he
         convicts the defendant." Tumey, supra, at 531, 47 S.Ct. 437; see also Aetna Life Ins. Co.

      <p>It may also violate due process when a judge presides over a criminal contempt case that
         resulted from the defendant's hostility towards the judge. In Mayberry v. Pennsylvania,
            <span class="citation">

         expletives and ad hominem attacks at the judge throughout the trial. When that defendant
         was subsequently charged with criminal contempt, we concluded that he "should be given a
         public trial before a judge other than the one reviled by the contemnor." Id., at 466, 91
         S.Ct. 499; see also Taylor v. Hayes, <span class="citation">

         defendant's criminal contempt trial).</p>
      <p>Our decisions in this area have also emphasized when the Due Process Clause does not
         require recusal:</p> "All questions of judicial qualification may not involve
      constitutional validity. Thus matters of kinship, personal bias, state policy, remoteness of
      interest, would seem generally to be matters merely of legislative discretion." Tumey, supra,
      at 523, 47 S.Ct. 437; see also Lavoie, supra, at 820, 106 S.Ct. 1580. <p>Subject to the two
         well-established exceptions described above, questions of judicial recusal are regulated by
         "common law, statute, or the professional standards of the bench and bar." Bracy v.
         Gramley, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/B7B/bracy-v-gramley/">

      <p>In any given case, there are a number of factors that could give rise to a "probability" or
         "appearance" of bias: friendship with a party or lawyer, prior employment experience,
         membership in clubs or associations, prior speeches and writings, religious affiliation,
         and countless other considerations. We have never held that the Due Process Clause requires
         recusal for any of these reasons, even though they could be viewed as presenting a
         "probability of bias." Many state statutes require recusal based on a probability or
         appearance of bias, but "that alone would not be sufficient basis for imposing a
         constitutional requirement under the Due Process Clause." Lavoie, supra, at 820, 106 S.Ct.
         1580 (emphasis added). States are, of <span class="star-pagination">*2269</span> course,
         free to adopt broader recusal rules than the Constitution requires&#x97;and every State
         has&#x97;but these developments are not continuously incorporated into the Due Process
         Clause.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>II</h2>
      <p>In departing from this clear line between when recusal is constitutionally required and
         when it is not, the majority repeatedly emphasizes the need for an "objective" standard.
         Ante, at 2256, 2259, 2261, 2262-2266. The majority's analysis is "objective" in that it
         does not inquire into Justice Benjamin's motives or decisionmaking process. But the
         standard the majority articulates&#x97;"probability of bias"&#x97;fails to provide clear,
         workable guidance for future cases. At the most basic level, it is unclear whether the new
         probability of bias standard is somehow limited to financial support in judicial elections,
         or applies to judicial recusal questions more generally.</p>
      <p>But there are other fundamental questions as well. With little help from the majority,
         courts will now have to determine:</p> 1. How much money is too much money? What level of
      contribution or expenditure gives rise to a "probability of bias"? 2. How do we determine
      whether a given expenditure is "disproportionate"? Disproportionate to what? 3. Are
      independent, non-coordinated expenditures treated the same as direct contributions to a
      candidate's campaign? What about contributions to independent outside groups supporting a
      candidate? 4. Does it matter whether the litigant has contributed to other candidates or made
      large expenditures in connection with other elections? 5. Does the amount at issue in the case
      matter? What if this case were an employment dispute with only $10,000 at stake? What if the
      plaintiffs only sought non-monetary relief such as an injunction or declaratory judgment? 6.
      Does the analysis change depending on whether the judge whose disqualification is sought sits
      on a trial court, appeals court, or state supreme court? 7. How long does the probability of
      bias last? Does the probability of bias diminish over time as the election recedes? Does it
      matter whether the judge plans to run for reelection? 8. What if the "disproportionately"
      large expenditure is made by an industry association, trade union, physicians' group, or the
      plaintiffs' bar? Must the judge recuse in all cases that affect the association's interests?
      Must the judge recuse in all cases in which a party or lawyer is a member of that group? Does
      it matter how much the litigant contributed to the association? 9. What if the case involves a
      social or ideological issue rather than a financial one? Must a judge recuse from cases
      involving, say, abortion rights if he has received "disproportionate" support from individuals
      who feel strongly about either side of that issue? If the supporter wants to help elect judges
      who are "tough on crime," must the judge recuse in all criminal cases? 10. What if the
      candidate draws "disproportionate" support from a particular racial, religious, ethnic, or
      other group, and the case involves an issue of particular importance to that group? <span
         class="star-pagination">*2270</span> 11. What if the supporter is not a party to the
      pending or imminent case, but his interests will be affected by the decision? Does the Court's
      analysis apply if the supporter "chooses the judge" not in his case, but in someone else's?
      12. What if the case implicates a regulatory issue that is of great importance to the party
      making the expenditures, even though he has no direct financial interest in the outcome (e.g.,
      a facial challenge to an agency rulemaking or a suit seeking to limit an agency's
      jurisdiction)? 13. Must the judge's vote be outcome determinative in order for his non-recusal
      to constitute a due process violation? 14. Does the due process analysis consider the
      underlying merits of the suit? Does it matter whether the decision is clearly right (or wrong)
      as a matter of state law? 15. What if a lower court decision in favor of the supporter is
      affirmed on the merits on appeal, by a panel with no "debt of gratitude" to the supporter?
      Does that "moot" the due process claim? 16. What if the judge voted against the supporter in
      many other cases? 17. What if the judge disagrees with the supporter's message or tactics?
      What if the judge expressly disclaims the support of this person? 18. Should we assume that
      elected judges feel a "debt of hostility" towards major opponents of their candidacies? Must
      the judge recuse in cases involving individuals or groups who spent large amounts of money
      trying unsuccessfully to defeat him? 19. If there is independent review of a judge's recusal
      decision, e.g., by a panel of other judges, does this completely foreclose a due process
      claim? 20. Does a debt of gratitude for endorsements by newspapers, interest groups,
      politicians, or celebrities also give rise to a constitutionally unacceptable probability of
      bias? How would we measure whether such support is disproportionate? 21. Does close personal
      friendship between a judge and a party or lawyer now give rise to a probability of bias? 22.
      Does it matter whether the campaign expenditures come from a party or the party's attorney? If
      from a lawyer, must the judge recuse in every case involving that attorney? 23. Does what is
      unconstitutional vary from State to State? What if particular States have a history of
      expensive judicial elections? 24. Under the majority's "objective" test, do we analyze the due
      process issue through the lens of a reasonable person, a reasonable lawyer, or a reasonable
      judge? 25. What role does causation play in this analysis? The Court sends conflicting signals
      on this point. The majority asserts that "[w]hether Blankenship's campaign contributions were
      a necessary and sufficient cause of Benjamin's victory is not the proper inquiry." Ante, at
      2264. But elsewhere in the opinion, the majority considers "the apparent effect such
      contribution had on the outcome of the election," ante, at 2264, and whether the litigant has
      been able to "choos[e] the <span class="star-pagination">*2271</span> judge in his own cause,"
      ante, at 2265. If causation is a pertinent factor, how do we know whether the contribution or
      expenditure had any effect on the outcome of the election? What if the judge won in a
      landslide? What if the judge won primarily because of his opponent's missteps? 26. Is the due
      process analysis less probing for incumbent judges&#x97; who typically have a great advantage
      in elections&#x97;than for challengers? 27. How final must the pending case be with respect to
      the contributor's interest? What if, for example, the only issue on appeal is whether the
      court should certify a class of plaintiffs? Is recusal required just as if the issue in the
      pending case were ultimate liability? 28. Which cases are implicated by this doctrine? Must
      the case be pending at the time of the election? Reasonably likely to be brought? What about
      an important but unanticipated case filed shortly after the election? 29. When do we impute a
      probability of bias from one party to another? Does a contribution from a corporation get
      imputed to its executives, and vice-versa? Does a contribution or expenditure by one family
      member get imputed to other family members? 30. What if the election is nonpartisan? What if
      the election is just a yes-or-no vote about whether to retain an incumbent? 31. What type of
      support is disqualifying? What if the supporter's expenditures are used to fund voter
      registration or get-out-the-vote efforts rather than television advertisements? 32. Are
      contributions or expenditures in connection with a primary aggregated with those in the
      general election? What if the contributor supported a different candidate in the primary? Does
      that dilute the debt of gratitude? 33. What procedures must be followed to challenge a state
      judge's failure to recuse? May Caperton claims only be raised on direct review? Or may such
      claims also be brought in federal district court under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which allows a person
      deprived of a federal right by a state official to sue for damages? If § 1983 claims are
      available, who are the proper defendants? The judge? The whole court? The clerk of court? 34.
      What about state-court cases that are already closed? Can the losing parties in those cases
      now seek collateral relief in federal district court under § 1983? What statutes of limitation
      should be applied to such suits? 35. What is the proper remedy? After a successful Caperton
      motion, must the parties start from scratch before the lower courts? Is any part of the lower
      court judgment retained? 36. Does a litigant waive his due process claim if he waits until
      after decision to raise it? Or would the claim only be ripe after decision, when the judge's
      actions or vote suggest a probability of bias? 37. Are the parties entitled to discovery with
      respect to the judge's recusal decision? <span class="star-pagination">*2272</span> 38. If a
      judge erroneously fails to recuse, do we apply harmless-error review? 39. Does the judge get
      to respond to the allegation that he is probably biased, or is his reputation solely in the
      hands of the parties to the case? 40. What if the parties settle a Caperton claim as part of a
      broader settlement of the case? Does that leave the judge with no way to salvage his
      reputation? <p>These are only a few uncertainties that quickly come to mind. Judges and
         litigants will surely encounter others when they are forced to, or wish to, apply the
         majority's decision in different circumstances. Today's opinion requires state and federal
         judges simultaneously to act as political scientists (why did candidate X win the
         election?), economists (was the financial support disproportionate?), and psychologists (is
         there likely to be a debt of gratitude?).</p>
      <p>The Court's inability to formulate a "judicially discernible and manageable standard"
         strongly counsels against the recognition of a novel constitutional right. See Vieth v.
         Jubelirer, <span class="citation">

         gerrymandering claims nonjusticiable based on the lack of workable standards); id., at 317,

         standards for measuring the burden a gerrymander imposes ... make our intervention
         improper"). The need to consider these and countless other questions helps explain why the
         common law and this Court's constitutional jurisprudence have never required
         disqualification on such vague grounds as "probability" or "appearance" of bias.</p>

      <h2>III</h2>
      <p/>
      <h2>A</h2>
      <p>To its credit, the Court seems to recognize that the inherently boundless nature of its new
         rule poses a problem. But the majority's only answer is that the present case is an
         "extreme" one, so there is no need to worry about other cases. Ante, at 2265. The Court
         repeats this point over and over. See ante, at 2263 ("this is an exceptional case"); ante,
         at 2265 ("On these extreme facts"); ibid. ("Our decision today addresses an extraordinary
         situation"); ante, at 2265 ("The facts now before us are extreme by any measure"); ante, at
         2267 (Court's rule will "be confined to rare instances").</p>
      <p>But this is just so much whistling past the graveyard. Claims that have little chance of
         success are nonetheless frequently filed. The success rate for certiorari petitions before
         this Court is approximately 1.1%, and yet the previous Term some 8,241 were filed. Every
         one of the "Caperton motions" or appeals or § 1983 actions will claim that the judge is
         biased, or probably biased, bringing the judge and the judicial system into disrepute. And
         all future litigants will assert that their case is really the most extreme thus far.</p>
      <p>Extreme cases often test the bounds of established legal principles. There is a cost to
         yielding to the desire to correct the extreme case, rather than adhering to the legal
         principle. That cost has been demonstrated so often that it is captured in a legal
         aphorism: "Hard cases make bad law."</p>

         </span>, 118 S.Ct. 488, 139 L.Ed.2d 450 (1997). Historically, we have held that the Double
         Jeopardy Clause only applies to <span class="star-pagination">*2273</span> criminal
         penalties, not civil ones. See, e.g., Helvering v. Mitchell, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/wBD/helvering-v-mitchell/">
               <span class="volume">303</span>

         </span>, 398-400, 58 S.Ct. 630, 82 L.Ed. 917 (1938). But in Halper, the Court held that a
         civil penalty could violate the Clause if it were "overwhelmingly disproportionate to the
         damages [the defendant] has caused" and resulted in a "clear injustice." 490 U.S., at 446,
         449, 109 S.Ct. 1892. We acknowledged that this inquiry would not be an "exact pursuit," but
         the Court assured litigants that it was only announcing "a rule for the rare case, the case
         such as the one before us." Id., at 449, 109 S.Ct. 1892; see also id., at 453, 109 S.Ct.
         1892 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) ("Today's holding, I would stress, constitutes an objective
         rule that is grounded in the nature of the sanction and the facts of the particular
         case").</p>
      <p>Just eight years later, we granted certiorari in Hudson "because of concerns about the wide
         variety of novel double jeopardy claims spawned in the wake of Halper." 522 U.S., at 98,
         118 S.Ct. 488; see also ibid., n. 4. The novel claim that we had recognized in Halper
         turned out not to be so "rare" after all, and the test we adopted in that
         case&#x97;"overwhelmingly disproportionate"&#x97;had "proved unworkable." Id., at 101-102,
         118 S.Ct. 488 (internal quotation marks omitted). We thus abandoned the Halper rule, ruing
         our "ill considered" "deviation from longstanding double jeopardy principles." Id., at 101,
         118 S.Ct. 488.</p>
      <p>The déjà vu is enough to make one swoon. Today, the majority again departs from a clear,
         longstanding constitutional rule to accommodate an "extreme" case involving "grossly
         disproportionate" amounts of money. I believe we will come to regret this decision as well,
         when courts are forced to deal with a wide variety of Caperton motions, each claiming the
         title of "most extreme" or "most disproportionate."</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>B</h2>
      <p>And why is the Court so convinced that this is an extreme case? It is true that Don
         Blankenship spent a large amount of money in connection with this election. But this point
         cannot be emphasized strongly enough: Other than a $1,000 direct contribution from
         Blankenship, Justice Benjamin and his campaign had no control over how this money was
         spent. Campaigns go to great lengths to develop precise messages and strategies. An
         insensitive or ham-handed ad campaign by an independent third party might distort the
         campaign's message or cause a backlash against the candidate, even though the candidate was
         not responsible for the ads. See Buckley v. Valeo, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/yvS/buckley-v-valeo/">
               <span class="volume">424</span>

            </a>
         </span>, 47, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (per curiam) ("Unlike contributions, such
         independent expenditures may well provide little assistance to the candidate's campaign and
         indeed may prove counterproductive"); see also Brief for Conference of Chief Justices as
         Amicus Curiae 27, n. 50 (citing examples of judicial elections in which independent
         expenditures backfired and hurt the candidate's campaign). The majority repeatedly
         characterizes Blankenship's spending as "contributions" or "campaign contributions," ante,
         at 2256, 2257-2258, 2264-2266, 2266-2267, but it is more accurate to refer to them as
         "independent expenditures." Blankenship only "contributed" $1,000 to the Benjamin
         campaign.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Blankenship's independent expenditures do not appear "grossly disproportionate"
         compared to other such expenditures in this very election. "And for the Sake of the
         Kids"&#x97;an independent group that received approximately two-thirds of its funding from
         Blankenship&#x97; spent $3,623,500 in connection with the election. App. 684a. But large
         independent expenditures were also made in support <span class="star-pagination"
            >*2274</span> of Justice Benjamin's opponent. "Consumers for Justice"&#x97;an
         independent group that received large contributions from the plaintiffs' bar&#x97;spent
         approximately $2 million in this race. Id., at 682a-683a, n. 41. And Blankenship has made
         large expenditures in connection with several previous West Virginia elections, which
         undercuts any notion that his involvement in this election was "intended to influence the
         outcome" of particular pending litigation. Brief for Petitioners 29.</p>
      <p>It is also far from clear that Blankenship's expenditures affected the outcome of this
         election. Justice Benjamin won by a comfortable 7-point margin (53.3% to 46.7%). Many
         observers believed that Justice Benjamin's opponent doomed his candidacy by giving a
         well-publicized speech that made several curious allegations; this speech was described in
         the local media as "deeply disturbing" and worse. App. 679a, n. 38. Justice Benjamin's
         opponent also refused to give interviews or participate in debates. All but one of the
         major West Virginia newspapers endorsed Justice Benjamin. Justice Benjamin just might have
         won because the voters of West Virginia thought he would be a better judge than his
         opponent. Unlike the majority, I cannot say with any degree of certainty that Blankenship
         "cho[se] the judge in his own cause." Ante, at 2265. I would give the voters of West
         Virginia more credit than that.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>* * *</h2>
      <p>It is an old cliché, but sometimes the cure is worse than the disease. I am sure there are
         cases where a "probability of bias" should lead the prudent judge to step aside, but the
         judge fails to do so. Maybe this is one of them. But I believe that opening the door to
         recusal claims under the Due Process Clause, for an amorphous "probability of bias," will
         itself bring our judicial system into undeserved disrepute, and diminish the confidence of
         the American people in the fairness and integrity of their courts. I hope I am wrong.</p>
      <p>I respectfully dissent.</p>
      </div><div type="" judge=""><p>Justice SCALIA, dissenting.</p>
      <p>The principal purpose of this Court's exercise of its certiorari jurisdiction is to clarify
         the law. See this Court's Rule 10. As THE CHIEF JUSTICE's dissent makes painfully clear,
         the principal consequence of today's decision is to create vast uncertainty with respect to
         a point of law that can be raised in all litigated cases in (at least) those 39 States that
         elect their judges. This course was urged upon us on grounds that it would preserve the
         public's confidence in the judicial system. Brief for Petitioners 16.</p>
      <p>The decision will have the opposite effect. What above all else is eroding public
         confidence in the Nation's judicial system is the perception that litigation is just a
         game, that the party with the most resourceful lawyer can play it to win, that our
         seemingly interminable legal proceedings are wonderfully self-perpetuating but incapable of
         delivering real-world justice. The Court's opinion will reinforce that perception, adding
         to the vast arsenal of lawyerly gambits what will come to be known as the Caperton claim.
         The facts relevant to adjudicating it will have to be litigated&#x97;and likewise the law
         governing it, which will be indeterminate for years to come, if not forever. Many billable
         hours will be spent in poring through volumes of campaign finance reports, and many more in
         contesting nonrecusal decisions through every available means.</p>
      <p>A Talmudic maxim instructs with respect to the Scripture: "Turn it over, and turn it over,
         for all is therein." The Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Aboth, Ch. V, <span
            class="star-pagination">*2275</span> Mishnah 22 (I. Epstein ed.1935). Divinely inspired
         text may contain the answers to all earthly questions, but the Due Process Clause most
         assuredly does not. The Court today continues its quixotic quest to right all wrongs and
         repair all imperfections through the Constitution. Alas, the quest cannot
         succeed&#x97;which is why some wrongs and imperfections have been called nonjusticiable. In
         the best of all possible worlds, should judges sometimes recuse even where the clear
         commands of our prior due process law do not require it? Undoubtedly. The relevant
         question, however, is whether we do more good than harm by seeking to correct this
         imperfection through expansion of our constitutional mandate in a manner ungoverned by any
         discernable rule. The answer is obvious.</p>
