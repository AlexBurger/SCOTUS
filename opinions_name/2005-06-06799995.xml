&#xD;
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&#xD;
                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT&#xD;
&#xD;
   No. 03–1454. Argued November 29, 2004—Decided June 6, 2005&#xD;
California’s Compassionate Use Act authorizes limited marijuana use&#xD;
  for medicinal purposes. Respondents Raich and Monson are Califor-&#xD;
  nia residents who both use doctor-recommended marijuana for seri-&#xD;
  ous medical conditions. After federal Drug Enforcement Administra-&#xD;
  tion (DEA) agents seized and destroyed all six of Monson’s cannabis&#xD;
  plants, respondents brought this action seeking injunctive and de-&#xD;
  claratory relief prohibiting the enforcement of the federal Controlled&#xD;
  Substances Act (CSA) to the extent it prevents them from possessing,&#xD;
  obtaining, or manufacturing cannabis for their personal medical use.&#xD;
  Respondents claim that enforcing the CSA against them would vio-&#xD;
  late the Commerce Clause and other constitutional provisions. The&#xD;
  District Court denied respondents’ motion for a preliminary injunc-&#xD;
  tion, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that they had demon-&#xD;
  strated a strong likelihood of success on the claim that the CSA is an&#xD;
  unconstitutional exercise of Congress’ Commerce Clause authority as&#xD;
  applied to the intrastate, noncommercial cultivation and possession of&#xD;
  cannabis for personal medical purposes as recommended by a patient’s&#xD;
  physician pursuant to valid California state law. The court relied&#xD;
  heavily on United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, and United States v.&#xD;
  Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, to hold that this separate class of purely lo-&#xD;
  cal activities was beyond the reach of federal power.&#xD;
Held: Congress’ Commerce Clause authority includes the power to pro-&#xD;
 hibit the local cultivation and use of marijuana in compliance with&#xD;
 California law. Pp. 6–31.&#xD;
    (a) For the purposes of consolidating various drug laws into a com-&#xD;
 prehensive statute, providing meaningful regulation over legitimate&#xD;
 sources of drugs to prevent diversion into illegal channels, and&#xD;

&#xD;
                                   Syllabus&#xD;
&#xD;
    strengthening law enforcement tools against international and inter-&#xD;
    state drug trafficking, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Drug&#xD;
    Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Title II of which is the&#xD;
    CSA. To effectuate the statutory goals, Congress devised a closed&#xD;
    regulatory system making it unlawful to manufacture, distribute,&#xD;
    dispense, or possess any controlled substance except as authorized by&#xD;
    the CSA. 21 U. S. C. §§841(a)(1), 844(a). All controlled substances&#xD;
    are classified into five schedules, §812, based on their accepted medi-&#xD;
    cal uses, their potential for abuse, and their psychological and physi-&#xD;
    cal effects on the body, §§811, 812. Marijuana is classified as a&#xD;
    Schedule I substance, §812(c), based on its high potential for abuse,&#xD;
    no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in medically&#xD;
    supervised treatment, §812(b)(1). This classification renders the&#xD;
    manufacture, distribution, or possession of marijuana a criminal of-&#xD;
    fense. §§841(a)(1), 844(a). Pp. 6–11.&#xD;
       (b) Congress’ power to regulate purely local activities that are part&#xD;
    of an economic “class of activities” that have a substantial effect on&#xD;
    interstate commerce is firmly established. See, e.g., Perez v. United&#xD;
    States, 402 U. S. 146, 151. If Congress decides that the “ ‘total inci-&#xD;
    dence’ ” of a practice poses a threat to a national market, it may regu-&#xD;
    late the entire class. See, e.g., id., at 154–155. Of particular rele-&#xD;
    vance here is Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 127–128, where, in&#xD;
    rejecting the appellee farmer’s contention that Congress’ admitted&#xD;
    power to regulate the production of wheat for commerce did not au-&#xD;
    thorize federal regulation of wheat production intended wholly for the&#xD;
    appellee’s own consumption, the Court established that Congress can&#xD;
    regulate purely intrastate activity that is not itself “commercial,” i.e.,&#xD;
    not produced for sale, if it concludes that failure to regulate that class&#xD;
    of activity would undercut the regulation of the interstate market in&#xD;
    that commodity. The similarities between this case and Wickard&#xD;
    are striking. In both cases, the regulation is squarely within Con-&#xD;
    gress’ commerce power because production of the commodity meant&#xD;
    for home consumption, be it wheat or marijuana, has a substantial ef-&#xD;
    fect on supply and demand in the national market for that commod-&#xD;
    ity. In assessing the scope of Congress’ Commerce Clause authority,&#xD;
    the Court need not determine whether respondents’ activities, taken&#xD;
    in the aggregate, substantially affect interstate commerce in fact, but&#xD;
    only whether a “rational basis” exists for so concluding. E.g., Lopez,&#xD;
    514 U. S., at 557. Given the enforcement difficulties that attend dis-&#xD;
    tinguishing between marijuana cultivated locally and marijuana&#xD;
    grown elsewhere, 21 U. S. C. §801(5), and concerns about diversion&#xD;
    into illicit channels, the Court has no difficulty concluding that Con-&#xD;
    gress had a rational basis for believing that failure to regulate the in-&#xD;
    trastate manufacture and possession of marijuana would leave a gap-&#xD;
                      Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                       3&#xD;

&#xD;
  ing hole in the CSA. Pp. 12–20.&#xD;
    (c) Respondents’ heavy reliance on Lopez and Morrison overlooks&#xD;
  the larger context of modern-era Commerce Clause jurisprudence&#xD;
  preserved by those cases, while also reading those cases far too&#xD;
  broadly. The statutory challenges at issue there were markedly dif-&#xD;
  ferent from the challenge here. Respondents ask the Court to excise&#xD;
  individual applications of a concededly valid comprehensive statutory&#xD;
  scheme. In contrast, in both Lopez and Morrison, the parties as-&#xD;
  serted that a particular statute or provision fell outside Congress’&#xD;
  commerce power in its entirety. This distinction is pivotal for the&#xD;
  Court has often reiterated that “[w]here the class of activities is regu-&#xD;
  lated and that class is within the reach of federal power, the courts&#xD;
  have no power ‘to excise, as trivial, individual instances’ of the class.”&#xD;
  Perez, 402 U. S., at 154. Moreover, the Court emphasized that the&#xD;
  laws at issue in Lopez and Morrison had nothing to do with “com-&#xD;
  merce” or any sort of economic enterprise. See Lopez, 514 U. S., at&#xD;
  561; Morrison, 529 U. S., at 610. In contrast, the CSA regulates&#xD;
  quintessentially economic activities: the production, distribution, and&#xD;
  consumption of commodities for which there is an established, and&#xD;
  lucrative, interstate market. Prohibiting the intrastate possession or&#xD;
  manufacture of an article of commerce is a rational means of regulat-&#xD;
  ing commerce in that product. The Ninth Circuit cast doubt on the&#xD;
  CSA’s constitutionality by isolating a distinct class of activities that it&#xD;
  held to be beyond the reach of federal power: the intrastate, non-&#xD;
  commercial cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for personal&#xD;
  medical purposes on the advice of a physician and in accordance with&#xD;
  state law. However, Congress clearly acted rationally in determining&#xD;
  that this subdivided class of activities is an essential part of the lar-&#xD;
  ger regulatory scheme. The case comes down to the claim that a locally&#xD;
  cultivated product that is used domestically rather than sold on the&#xD;
  open market is not subject to federal regulation. Given the CSA’s find-&#xD;
  ings and the undisputed magnitude of the commercial market for mari-&#xD;
  juana, Wickard and its progeny foreclose that claim. Pp. 20–30.&#xD;
352 F. 3d 1222, vacated and remanded.&#xD;

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&#xD;
            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&#xD;
                                 [June 6, 2005]&#xD;
&#xD;
   JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.&#xD;
   California is one of at least nine States that authorize&#xD;
the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.1 The ques-&#xD;
tion presented in this case is whether the power vested in&#xD;
Congress by Article I, §8, of the Constitution “[t]o make all&#xD;
Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying&#xD;
into Execution” its authority to “regulate Commerce with&#xD;
foreign Nations, and among the several States” includes&#xD;
the power to prohibit the local cultivation and use of mari-&#xD;
juana in compliance with California law.&#xD;

&#xD;
                          Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
                              I&#xD;
   California has been a pioneer in the regulation of mari-&#xD;
juana. In 1913, California was one of the first States to&#xD;
prohibit the sale and possession of marijuana,2 and at the&#xD;
end of the century, California became the first State to&#xD;
authorize limited use of the drug for medicinal purposes.&#xD;
In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, now&#xD;
codified as the Compassionate Use Act of 1996.3 The propo-&#xD;
sition was designed to ensure that “seriously ill” residents of&#xD;
the State have access to marijuana for medical purposes,&#xD;
and to encourage Federal and State Governments to take&#xD;
steps towards ensuring the safe and affordable distribution&#xD;
of the drug to patients in need.4 The Act creates an exemp-&#xD;
tion from criminal prosecution for physicians,5 as well as for&#xD;

  3 Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. §11362.5 (West Supp. 2005). The&#xD;
&#xD;
California Legislature recently enacted additional legislation supple-&#xD;
menting the Compassionate Use Act. §§11362.7–11362.9 (West Supp.&#xD;
2005).&#xD;
  4 “The people of the State of California hereby find and declare that&#xD;
&#xD;
the purposes of the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 are as follows:&#xD;
  “(A) To ensure that seriously ill Californians have the right to obtain&#xD;
and use marijuana for medical purposes where that medical use is&#xD;
deemed appropriate and has been recommended by a physician who&#xD;
has determined that the person’s health would benefit from the use of&#xD;
marijuana in the treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain,&#xD;
spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which&#xD;
marijuana provides relief.&#xD;
  “(B) To ensure that patients and their primary caregivers who obtain&#xD;
and use marijuana for medical purposes upon the recommendation of a&#xD;

   Respondents Angel Raich and Diane Monson are Cali-&#xD;
fornia residents who suffer from a variety of serious medi-&#xD;
cal conditions and have sought to avail themselves of&#xD;
medical marijuana pursuant to the terms of the Compas-&#xD;
sionate Use Act. They are being treated by licensed,&#xD;
board-certified family practitioners, who have concluded,&#xD;
after prescribing a host of conventional medicines to treat&#xD;
respondents’ conditions and to alleviate their associated&#xD;
symptoms, that marijuana is the only drug available that&#xD;
provides effective treatment. Both women have been&#xD;
using marijuana as a medication for several years pursu-&#xD;
ant to their doctors’ recommendation, and both rely heav-&#xD;
ily on cannabis to function on a daily basis. Indeed,&#xD;
Raich’s physician believes that forgoing cannabis treat-&#xD;
ments would certainly cause Raich excruciating pain and&#xD;
could very well prove fatal.&#xD;
   Respondent Monson cultivates her own marijuana, and&#xD;
ingests the drug in a variety of ways including smoking&#xD;
and using a vaporizer. Respondent Raich, by contrast, is&#xD;
unable to cultivate her own, and thus relies on two care-&#xD;
givers, litigating as “John Does,” to provide her with lo-&#xD;
cally grown marijuana at no charge. These caregivers also&#xD;

process the cannabis into hashish or keif, and Raich her-&#xD;
self processes some of the marijuana into oils, balms, and&#xD;
foods for consumption.&#xD;
   On August 15, 2002, county deputy sheriffs and agents&#xD;
from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)&#xD;
came to Monson’s home. After a thorough investigation,&#xD;
the county officials concluded that her use of marijuana&#xD;
was entirely lawful as a matter of California law. Never-&#xD;
theless, after a 3-hour standoff, the federal agents seized&#xD;
and destroyed all six of her cannabis plants.&#xD;
   Respondents thereafter brought this action against the&#xD;
Attorney General of the United States and the head of the&#xD;
DEA seeking injunctive and declaratory relief prohibiting&#xD;
the enforcement of the federal Controlled Substances Act&#xD;
(CSA), 84 Stat. 1242, 21 U. S. C. §801 et seq., to the extent&#xD;
it prevents them from possessing, obtaining, or manufac-&#xD;
turing cannabis for their personal medical use. In their&#xD;
complaint and supporting affidavits, Raich and Monson&#xD;
described the severity of their afflictions, their repeatedly&#xD;
futile attempts to obtain relief with conventional medica-&#xD;
tions, and the opinions of their doctors concerning their&#xD;
need to use marijuana. Respondents claimed that enforc-&#xD;
ing the CSA against them would violate the Commerce&#xD;
Clause, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,&#xD;
the Ninth and Tenth Amendments of the Constitution,&#xD;
and the doctrine of medical necessity.&#xD;
   The District Court denied respondents’ motion for a&#xD;
preliminary injunction. Raich v. Ashcroft, <span class="citation no-link">

         <span class="page">918</span>
      </span> (ND Cal. 2003). Although the court found that the&#xD;
federal enforcement interests “wane[d]” when compared to&#xD;
the harm that California residents would suffer if denied&#xD;
access to medically necessary marijuana, it concluded that&#xD;
respondents could not demonstrate a likelihood of success&#xD;
on the merits of their legal claims. Id., at 931.&#xD;

Circuit reversed and ordered the District Court to enter a&#xD;

&#xD;
preliminary injunction.8 Raich v. Ashcroft, 352 F. 3d 1222&#xD;
(2003). The court found that respondents had “demon-&#xD;
strated a strong likelihood of success on their claim that,&#xD;
as applied to them, the CSA is an unconstitutional exer-&#xD;
cise of Congress’ Commerce Clause authority.” Id., at&#xD;
1227. The Court of Appeals distinguished prior Circuit&#xD;
cases upholding the CSA in the face of Commerce Clause&#xD;
challenges by focusing on what it deemed to be the “sepa-&#xD;
rate and distinct class of activities” at issue in this case:&#xD;
“the intrastate, noncommercial cultivation and possession of&#xD;
cannabis for personal medical purposes as recommended by&#xD;
a patient’s physician pursuant to valid California state law.”&#xD;
Id., at 1228. The court found the latter class of activities&#xD;
“different in kind from drug trafficking” because interposing&#xD;
a physician’s recommendation raises different health and&#xD;
safety concerns, and because “this limited use is clearly&#xD;
distinct from the broader illicit drug market—as well as&#xD;
any broader commercial market for medicinal mari-&#xD;
juana—insofar as the medicinal marijuana at issue in this&#xD;
case is not intended for, nor does it enter, the stream of&#xD;
commerce.” Ibid.&#xD;
   The majority placed heavy reliance on our decisions in&#xD;
United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), and United&#xD;
States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000), as interpreted by&#xD;
recent Circuit precedent, to hold that this separate class of&#xD;
purely local activities was beyond the reach of federal&#xD;
power. In contrast, the dissenting judge concluded that&#xD;

                          Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
the CSA, as applied to respondents, was clearly valid&#xD;
under Lopez and Morrison; moreover, he thought it “sim-&#xD;
ply impossible to distinguish the relevant conduct sur-&#xD;
rounding the cultivation and use of the marijuana crop at&#xD;
issue in this case from the cultivation and use of the wheat&#xD;
crop that affected interstate commerce in Wickard v.&#xD;
Filburn.” 352 F. 3d, at 1235 (Beam, J., dissenting) (cita-&#xD;
tion omitted).&#xD;
   The obvious importance of the case prompted our grant&#xD;
of certiorari. 542 U. S. 936 (2004). The case is made&#xD;
difficult by respondents’ strong arguments that they will&#xD;
suffer irreparable harm because, despite a congressional&#xD;
finding to the contrary, marijuana does have valid thera-&#xD;
peutic purposes. The question before us, however, is not&#xD;
whether it is wise to enforce the statute in these circum-&#xD;
stances; rather, it is whether Congress’ power to regulate&#xD;
interstate markets for medicinal substances encompasses&#xD;
the portions of those markets that are supplied with drugs&#xD;
produced and consumed locally. Well-settled law controls&#xD;
our answer. The CSA is a valid exercise of federal power,&#xD;
even as applied to the troubling facts of this case. We&#xD;
accordingly vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals.&#xD;

   Shortly after taking office in 1969, President Nixon&#xD;
declared a national “war on drugs.”9 As the first campaign&#xD;
of that war, Congress set out to enact legislation that&#xD;
would consolidate various drug laws on the books into a&#xD;
comprehensive statute, provide meaningful regulation&#xD;
over legitimate sources of drugs to prevent diversion into&#xD;
illegal channels, and strengthen law enforcement tools&#xD;
against the traffic in illicit drugs.10 That effort culminated&#xD;

&#xD;
in the passage of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Preven-&#xD;
tion and Control Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1236.&#xD;
   This was not, however, Congress’ first attempt to regu-&#xD;
late the national market in drugs. Rather, as early as&#xD;
1906 Congress enacted federal legislation imposing label-&#xD;
ing regulations on medications and prohibiting the manu-&#xD;
facture or shipment of any adulterated or misbranded&#xD;
drug traveling in interstate commerce.11 Aside from these&#xD;
labeling restrictions, most domestic drug regulations prior&#xD;
to 1970 generally came in the guise of revenue laws, with&#xD;
the Department of the Treasury serving as the Federal&#xD;
Government’s primary enforcer.12 For example, the pri-&#xD;
mary drug control law, before being repealed by the pas-&#xD;
sage of the CSA, was the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914,&#xD;
38 Stat. 785 (repealed 1970). The Harrison Act sought to&#xD;
exert control over the possession and sale of narcotics,&#xD;
specifically cocaine and opiates, by requiring producers,&#xD;
distributors, and purchasers to register with the Federal&#xD;
Government, by assessing taxes against parties so regis-&#xD;
tered, and by regulating the issuance of prescriptions.13&#xD;
   Marijuana itself was not significantly regulated by the&#xD;
Federal Government until 1937 when accounts of mari-&#xD;
juana’s addictive qualities and physiological effects, paired&#xD;
with dissatisfaction with enforcement efforts at state and&#xD;
local levels, prompted Congress to pass the Marihuana&#xD;
Tax Act, Pub. L. 75–238, 50 Stat. 551 (repealed 1970).14&#xD;

trade, by this time all States had in place some form of legislation&#xD;
8                      GONZALES v. RAICH&#xD;
&#xD;
                        Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
Like the Harrison Act, the Marihuana Tax Act did not&#xD;
outlaw the possession or sale of marijuana outright.&#xD;
Rather, it imposed registration and reporting require-&#xD;
ments for all individuals importing, producing, selling, or&#xD;
dealing in marijuana, and required the payment of annual&#xD;
taxes in addition to transfer taxes whenever the drug&#xD;
changed hands.15 Moreover, doctors wishing to prescribe&#xD;
marijuana for medical purposes were required to comply&#xD;
with rather burdensome administrative requirements.16&#xD;
Noncompliance exposed traffickers to severe federal penal-&#xD;
ties, whereas compliance would often subject them to&#xD;
prosecution under state law.17 Thus, while the Marihuana&#xD;
Tax Act did not declare the drug illegal per se, the onerous&#xD;
administrative requirements, the prohibitively expensive&#xD;
taxes, and the risks attendant on compliance practically&#xD;
curtailed the marijuana trade.&#xD;
   Then in 1970, after declaration of the national “war on&#xD;
drugs,” federal drug policy underwent a significant trans-&#xD;
formation. A number of noteworthy events precipitated&#xD;
this policy shift. First, in Leary v. United States, 395 U. S.&#xD;
6 (1969), this Court held certain provisions of the Marihu-&#xD;
ana Tax Act and other narcotics legislation unconstitu-&#xD;
tional. Second, at the end of his term, President Johnson&#xD;
fundamentally reorganized the federal drug control agen-&#xD;
cies. The Bureau of Narcotics, then housed in the De-&#xD;
partment of Treasury, merged with the Bureau of Drug&#xD;
Abuse Control, then housed in the Department of Health,&#xD;
Education, and Welfare (HEW), to create the Bureau of&#xD;
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, currently housed in the&#xD;
Department of Justice.18 Finally, prompted by a perceived&#xD;

&#xD;
need to consolidate the growing number of piecemeal drug&#xD;
laws and to enhance federal drug enforcement powers,&#xD;
Congress enacted the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Preven-&#xD;
tion and Control Act.19&#xD;
   Title II of that Act, the CSA, repealed most of the earlier&#xD;
antidrug laws in favor of a comprehensive regime to com-&#xD;
bat the international and interstate traffic in illicit drugs.&#xD;
The main objectives of the CSA were to conquer drug&#xD;
abuse and to control the legitimate and illegitimate traffic&#xD;
in controlled substances.20 Congress was particularly&#xD;
——————&#xD;
of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs became the Drug Enforcement&#xD;
Administration (DEA). See Reorg. Plan No. 2 of 1973, §1, 28 CFR&#xD;
§0.100 (1973).&#xD;
   19 The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of&#xD;
&#xD;
1970 consists of three titles. Title I relates to the prevention and&#xD;
treatment of narcotic addicts through HEW (now the Department of&#xD;
Health and Human Services). 84 Stat. 1238. Title II, as discussed in&#xD;
more detail above, addresses drug control and enforcement as adminis-&#xD;
tered by the Attorney General and the DEA. Id., at 1242. Title III&#xD;
concerns the import and export of controlled substances. Id., at 1285.&#xD;
   20 In particular, Congress made the following findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
   “(1) Many of the drugs included within this subchapter have a useful&#xD;
and legitimate medical purpose and are necessary to maintain the&#xD;
health and general welfare of the American people.&#xD;
   “(2) The illegal importation, manufacture, distribution, and posses-&#xD;
sion and improper use of controlled substances have a substantial and&#xD;
detrimental effect on the health and general welfare of the American&#xD;
people.&#xD;
   “(3) A major portion of the traffic in controlled substances flows&#xD;
through interstate and foreign commerce. Incidents of the traffic which&#xD;
are not an integral part of the interstate or foreign flow, such as manu-&#xD;
facture, local distribution, and possession, nonetheless have a substan-&#xD;
tial and direct effect upon interstate commerce because—&#xD;
      “(A) after manufacture, many controlled substances are trans-&#xD;
ported in interstate commerce,&#xD;
      “(B) controlled substances distributed locally usually have been&#xD;
transported in interstate commerce immediately before their distribu-&#xD;
tion, and&#xD;
      “(C) controlled substances possessed commonly flow through&#xD;
interstate commerce immediately prior to such possession.&#xD;
10                        GONZALES v. RAICH&#xD;
&#xD;
                           Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
concerned with the need to prevent the diversion of drugs&#xD;
from legitimate to illicit channels.21&#xD;
  To effectuate these goals, Congress devised a closed&#xD;
regulatory system making it unlawful to manufacture,&#xD;
distribute, dispense, or possess any controlled substance&#xD;
except in a manner authorized by the CSA. 21 U. S. C.&#xD;
§§841(a)(1), 844(a). The CSA categorizes all controlled&#xD;
substances into five schedules. §812. The drugs are&#xD;
grouped together based on their accepted medical uses,&#xD;
the potential for abuse, and their psychological and physi-&#xD;
cal effects on the body. §§811, 812. Each schedule is&#xD;
associated with a distinct set of controls regarding the&#xD;
manufacture, distribution, and use of the substances listed&#xD;
therein. §§821–830. The CSA and its implementing&#xD;
regulations set forth strict requirements regarding regis-&#xD;
tration, labeling and packaging, production quotas, drug&#xD;
security, and recordkeeping. Ibid. 21 CFR §1301 et seq.&#xD;
(2004).&#xD;
  In enacting the CSA, Congress classified marijuana as a&#xD;
Schedule I drug. 21 U. S. C. §812(c). This preliminary&#xD;
classification was based, in part, on the recommendation&#xD;
of the Assistant Secretary of HEW “that marihuana be&#xD;
retained within schedule I at least until the completion of&#xD;
&#xD;
——————&#xD;
   “(4) Local distribution and possession of controlled substances con-&#xD;
tribute to swelling the interstate traffic in such substances.&#xD;
   “(5) Controlled substances manufactured and distributed intrastate&#xD;
cannot be differentiated from controlled substances manufactured and&#xD;
distributed interstate. Thus, it is not feasible to distinguish, in terms of&#xD;
controls, between controlled substances manufactured and distributed&#xD;
interstate and controlled substances manufactured and distributed&#xD;
intrastate.&#xD;
   “(6) Federal control of the intrastate incidents of the traffic in con-&#xD;
trolled substances is essential to the effective control of the interstate&#xD;
incidents of such traffic.” 21 U. S. C. §§801(1)–(6).&#xD;

                         Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
certain studies now underway.”22 Schedule I drugs are&#xD;
categorized as such because of their high potential for&#xD;
abuse, lack of any accepted medical use, and absence of&#xD;
any accepted safety for use in medically supervised treat-&#xD;
ment. §812(b)(1). These three factors, in varying grada-&#xD;
tions, are also used to categorize drugs in the other four&#xD;
schedules. For example, Schedule II substances also have&#xD;
a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psy-&#xD;
chological or physical dependence, but unlike Schedule I&#xD;
drugs, they have a currently accepted medical use.&#xD;
§812(b)(2). By classifying marijuana as a Schedule I drug,&#xD;
as opposed to listing it on a lesser schedule, the manufac-&#xD;
ture, distribution, or possession of marijuana became a&#xD;
criminal offense, with the sole exception being use of the&#xD;
drug as part of a Food and Drug Administration pre-&#xD;
approved research study. §§823(f), 841(a)(1), 844(a); see&#xD;
also United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Coopera-&#xD;
tive, 532 U. S. 483, 490 (2001).&#xD;
   The CSA provides for the periodic updating of schedules&#xD;
and delegates authority to the Attorney General, after&#xD;
consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human&#xD;
Services, to add, remove, or transfer substances to, from,&#xD;
or between schedules. §811. Despite considerable efforts&#xD;
to reschedule marijuana, it remains a Schedule I drug.23&#xD;

continued to deny marijuana access to seriously ill patients, and&#xD;
concluded that it should be reclassified as a Schedule III substance,&#xD;
Grinspoon v. DEA, 828 F. 2d 881, 883–884 (CA1 1987), the campaign&#xD;
has proved unsuccessful. The DEA Administrator did not endorse the&#xD;
ALJ’s findings, 54 Fed. Reg. 53767 (1989), and since that time has&#xD;
routinely denied petitions to reschedule the drug, most recently in&#xD;

   Respondents in this case do not dispute that passage of&#xD;
the CSA, as part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Pre-&#xD;
vention and Control Act, was well within Congress’ com-&#xD;
merce power. Brief for Respondents 22, 38. Nor do they&#xD;
contend that any provision or section of the CSA amounts&#xD;
to an unconstitutional exercise of congressional authority.&#xD;
Rather, respondents’ challenge is actually quite limited;&#xD;
they argue that the CSA’s categorical prohibition of the&#xD;
manufacture and possession of marijuana as applied to&#xD;
the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana&#xD;
for medical purposes pursuant to California law exceeds&#xD;
Congress’ authority under the Commerce Clause.&#xD;
   In assessing the validity of congressional regulation,&#xD;
none of our Commerce Clause cases can be viewed in&#xD;
isolation. As charted in considerable detail in United&#xD;
States v. Lopez, our understanding of the reach of the&#xD;
Commerce Clause, as well as Congress’ assertion of au-&#xD;
thority thereunder, has evolved over time.24 The Com-&#xD;
merce Clause emerged as the Framers’ response to the&#xD;
central problem giving rise to the Constitution itself: the&#xD;
absence of any federal commerce power under the Articles&#xD;
of Confederation.25 For the first century of our history, the&#xD;
primary use of the Clause was to preclude the kind of&#xD;
discriminatory state legislation that had once been per-&#xD;

missible.26 Then, in response to rapid industrial develop-&#xD;
ment and an increasingly interdependent national econ-&#xD;
omy, Congress “ushered in a new era of federal regulation&#xD;
under the commerce power,” beginning with the enact-&#xD;
ment of the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887, 24 Stat.&#xD;
379, and the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890, 26 Stat. 209,&#xD;
as amended, 15 U. S. C. §2 et seq.27&#xD;
   Cases decided during that “new era,” which now spans&#xD;
more than a century, have identified three general catego-&#xD;
ries of regulation in which Congress is authorized to en-&#xD;
gage under its commerce power. First, Congress can&#xD;
regulate the channels of interstate commerce. Perez v.&#xD;
United States, 402 U. S. 146, 150 (1971). Second, Congress&#xD;
has authority to regulate and protect the instrumentalities&#xD;
of interstate commerce, and persons or things in interstate&#xD;
commerce. Ibid. Third, Congress has the power to regu-&#xD;
late activities that substantially affect interstate com-&#xD;
merce. Ibid.; NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., 301&#xD;
U. S. 1, 37 (1937). Only the third category is implicated in&#xD;
the case at hand.&#xD;
   Our case law firmly establishes Congress’ power to&#xD;
regulate purely local activities that are part of an eco-&#xD;
nomic “class of activities” that have a substantial effect on&#xD;
interstate commerce. See, e.g., Perez, 402 U. S., at 151;&#xD;

op., at 8–9).&#xD;
  27 Lopez, 514 U. S., at 554; see also Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S.&#xD;
&#xD;
111, 121 (1942) (“It was not until 1887, with the enactment of the&#xD;
Interstate Commerce Act, that the interstate commerce power began&#xD;
to exert positive influence in American law and life. This first impor-&#xD;
tant federal resort to the commerce power was followed in 1890 by the&#xD;
Sherman Anti-Trust Act and, thereafter, mainly after 1903, by many&#xD;
others. These statutes ushered in new phases of adjudication, which&#xD;
required the Court to approach the interpretation of the Commerce&#xD;
Clause in the light of an actual exercise by Congress of its power&#xD;
thereunder” (footnotes omitted)).&#xD;
14                   GONZALES v. RAICH&#xD;
&#xD;
                      Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 128–129 (1942). As we&#xD;
stated in Wickard, “even if appellee’s activity be local and&#xD;
though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still,&#xD;
whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a&#xD;
substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.” Id.,&#xD;
at 125. We have never required Congress to legislate with&#xD;
scientific exactitude. When Congress decides that the&#xD;
“ ‘total incidence’ ” of a practice poses a threat to a national&#xD;
market, it may regulate the entire class. See Perez, 402&#xD;
U. S., at 154–155 (quoting Westfall v. United States, 274&#xD;
U. S. 256, 259 (1927) (“[W]hen it is necessary in order to&#xD;
prevent an evil to make the law embrace more than the&#xD;
precise thing to be prevented it may do so”)). In this vein,&#xD;
we have reiterated that when “‘a general regulatory statute&#xD;
bears a substantial relation to commerce, the de minimis&#xD;
character of individual instances arising under that statute&#xD;
is of no consequence.’” E.g., Lopez, 514 U. S., at 558 (em-&#xD;
phasis deleted) (quoting Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183,&#xD;
196, n. 27 (1968)).&#xD;
    Our decision in Wickard, 317 U. S. 111, is of particular&#xD;
relevance. In Wickard, we upheld the application of regu-&#xD;
lations promulgated under the Agricultural Adjustment&#xD;
Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 31, which were designed to control&#xD;
the volume of wheat moving in interstate and foreign&#xD;
commerce in order to avoid surpluses and consequent&#xD;
abnormally low prices. The regulations established an&#xD;
allotment of 11.1 acres for Filburn’s 1941 wheat crop, but&#xD;
he sowed 23 acres, intending to use the excess by consum-&#xD;
ing it on his own farm. Filburn argued that even though&#xD;
we had sustained Congress’ power to regulate the produc-&#xD;
tion of goods for commerce, that power did not authorize&#xD;
“federal regulation [of] production not intended in any&#xD;
part for commerce but wholly for consumption on the&#xD;
farm.” Wickard, 317 U. S., at 118. Justice Jackson’s&#xD;
opinion for a unanimous Court rejected this submission.&#xD;
He wrote:&#xD;
                     Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                   15&#xD;
&#xD;
                          Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
     “The effect of the statute before us is to restrict the&#xD;
     amount which may be produced for market and the&#xD;
     extent as well to which one may forestall resort to the&#xD;
     market by producing to meet his own needs. That ap-&#xD;
     pellee’s own contribution to the demand for wheat&#xD;
     may be trivial by itself is not enough to remove him&#xD;
     from the scope of federal regulation where, as here,&#xD;
     his contribution, taken together with that of many&#xD;
     others similarly situated, is far from trivial.” Id., at&#xD;
     127–128.&#xD;
Wickard thus establishes that Congress can regulate&#xD;
purely intrastate activity that is not itself “commercial,” in&#xD;
that it is not produced for sale, if it concludes that failure&#xD;
to regulate that class of activity would undercut the regu-&#xD;
lation of the interstate market in that commodity.&#xD;
  The similarities between this case and Wickard are&#xD;
striking. Like the farmer in Wickard, respondents are&#xD;
cultivating, for home consumption, a fungible commodity&#xD;
for which there is an established, albeit illegal, interstate&#xD;
market.28 Just as the Agricultural Adjustment Act was&#xD;
designed “to control the volume [of wheat] moving in&#xD;
interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid sur-&#xD;
pluses . . .” and consequently control the market price,&#xD;
id., at 115, a primary purpose of the CSA is to control the&#xD;
supply and demand of controlled substances in both&#xD;
lawful and unlawful drug markets. See nn. 20–21, supra.&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  28 Even respondents acknowledge the existence of an illicit market in&#xD;
&#xD;
marijuana; indeed, Raich has personally participated in that market,&#xD;
and Monson expresses a willingness to do so in the future. App. 59, 74,&#xD;
87. See also Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S.&#xD;

16                     GONZALES v. RAICH&#xD;
&#xD;
                        Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
In Wickard, we had no difficulty concluding that Con-&#xD;
gress had a rational basis for believing that, when viewed&#xD;
in the aggregate, leaving home-consumed wheat outside&#xD;
the regulatory scheme would have a substantial influence&#xD;
on price and market conditions. Here too, Congress had&#xD;
a rational basis for concluding that leaving home-&#xD;
consumed marijuana outside federal control would simi-&#xD;
larly affect price and market conditions.&#xD;
   More concretely, one concern prompting inclusion of&#xD;
wheat grown for home consumption in the 1938 Act was&#xD;
that rising market prices could draw such wheat into the&#xD;
interstate market, resulting in lower market prices.&#xD;
Wickard, 317 U. S., at 128. The parallel concern making it&#xD;
appropriate to include marijuana grown for home con-&#xD;
sumption in the CSA is the likelihood that the high de-&#xD;
mand in the interstate market will draw such marijuana&#xD;
into that market. While the diversion of homegrown&#xD;
wheat tended to frustrate the federal interest in stabiliz-&#xD;
ing prices by regulating the volume of commercial transac-&#xD;
tions in the interstate market, the diversion of homegrown&#xD;
marijuana tends to frustrate the federal interest in elimi-&#xD;
nating commercial transactions in the interstate market&#xD;
in their entirety. In both cases, the regulation is squarely&#xD;
within Congress’ commerce power because production of&#xD;
the commodity meant for home consumption, be it wheat&#xD;
or marijuana, has a substantial effect on supply and de-&#xD;
mand in the national market for that commodity.29&#xD;
——————&#xD;
   29 To be sure, the wheat market is a lawful market that Congress&#xD;
&#xD;
sought to protect and stabilize, whereas the marijuana market is an&#xD;
unlawful market that Congress sought to eradicate. This difference,&#xD;
however, is of no constitutional import. It has long been settled that&#xD;
Congress’ power to regulate commerce includes the power to prohibit&#xD;
commerce in a particular commodity. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 571 (KENNEDY,&#xD;
J., concurring) (“In the Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321 (1903), the Court&#xD;
rejected the argument that Congress lacked [the] power to prohibit the&#xD;
interstate movement of lottery tickets because it had power only to&#xD;
regulate, not to prohibit”); see also Wickard, 317 U. S., at 128 (“The&#xD;
                     Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                  17&#xD;
&#xD;
                         Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
  Nonetheless, respondents suggest that Wickard differs&#xD;
from this case in three respects: (1) the Agricultural Ad-&#xD;
justment Act, unlike the CSA, exempted small farming&#xD;
operations; (2) Wickard involved a “quintessential eco-&#xD;
nomic activity”—a commercial farm—whereas respon-&#xD;
dents do not sell marijuana; and (3) the Wickard record&#xD;
made it clear that the aggregate production of wheat for&#xD;
use on farms had a significant impact on market prices.&#xD;
Those differences, though factually accurate, do not dimin-&#xD;
ish the precedential force of this Court’s reasoning.&#xD;
  The fact that Wickard’s own impact on the market was&#xD;
“trivial by itself ” was not a sufficient reason for removing&#xD;
him from the scope of federal regulation. 317 U. S., at&#xD;
127. That the Secretary of Agriculture elected to exempt&#xD;
even smaller farms from regulation does not speak to his&#xD;
power to regulate all those whose aggregated production&#xD;
was significant, nor did that fact play any role in the&#xD;
Court’s analysis. Moreover, even though Wickard was&#xD;
indeed a commercial farmer, the activity he was engaged&#xD;
in—the cultivation of wheat for home consumption—was&#xD;
not treated by the Court as part of his commercial farming&#xD;
operation.30 And while it is true that the record in the&#xD;
Wickard case itself established the causal connection&#xD;
between the production for local use and the national&#xD;
market, we have before us findings by Congress to the&#xD;
same effect.&#xD;
  Findings in the introductory sections of the CSA explain&#xD;
why Congress deemed it appropriate to encompass local&#xD;
activities within the scope of the CSA. See n. 20, supra.&#xD;
The submissions of the parties and the numerous amici all&#xD;
seem to agree that the national, and international, market&#xD;
&#xD;
——————&#xD;
stimulation of commerce is a use of the regulatory function quite as&#xD;
definitely as prohibitions or restrictions thereon”).&#xD;
  30 See Wickard, 317 U. S., at 125 (recognizing that Wickard’s activity&#xD;
&#xD;
“may not be regarded as commerce”).&#xD;
18                        GONZALES v. RAICH&#xD;
&#xD;
                           Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
for marijuana has dimensions that are fully comparable to&#xD;
those defining the class of activities regulated by the&#xD;
Secretary pursuant to the 1938 statute.31 Respondents&#xD;
nonetheless insist that the CSA cannot be constitutionally&#xD;
applied to their activities because Congress did not make a&#xD;
specific finding that the intrastate cultivation and posses-&#xD;
sion of marijuana for medical purposes based on the rec-&#xD;
ommendation of a physician would substantially affect the&#xD;
larger interstate marijuana market. Be that as it may, we&#xD;
have never required Congress to make particularized&#xD;
findings in order to legislate, see Lopez, 514 U. S., at 562;&#xD;
Perez, 402 U. S., at 156, absent a special concern such as&#xD;
the protection of free speech, see, e.g., Turner Broadcast-&#xD;
ing System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 664–668 (1994)&#xD;
(plurality opinion).     While congressional findings are&#xD;
certainly helpful in reviewing the substance of a congres-&#xD;
sional statutory scheme, particularly when the connection&#xD;
to commerce is not self-evident, and while we will consider&#xD;
congressional findings in our analysis when they are&#xD;
available, the absence of particularized findings does not&#xD;
call into question Congress’ authority to legislate.32&#xD;

   31 The Executive Office of the President has estimated that in 2000&#xD;

American users spent $10.5 billion on the purchase of marijuana. Office of&#xD;

.html (all Internet materials as visited June 2, 2005, and available in Clerk&#xD;

   32 Moreover, as discussed in more detail above, Congress did make&#xD;
&#xD;
findings regarding the effects of intrastate drug activity on interstate&#xD;
commerce. See n. 20, supra. Indeed, even the Court of Appeals found&#xD;
that those findings “weigh[ed] in favor” of upholding the constitutional-&#xD;
ity of the CSA. 352 F. 3d 1222, 1232 (CA9 2003) (case below). The&#xD;
dissenters, however, would impose a new and heightened burden on&#xD;
Congress (unless the litigants can garner evidence sufficient to cure&#xD;
Congress’ perceived “inadequa[cies]”)—that legislation must contain&#xD;
detailed findings proving that each activity regulated within a compre-&#xD;
hensive statute is essential to the statutory scheme. Post, at 13–15&#xD;

&#xD;
                          Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
  In assessing the scope of Congress’ authority under the&#xD;
Commerce Clause, we stress that the task before us is a&#xD;
modest one. We need not determine whether respondents’&#xD;
activities, taken in the aggregate, substantially affect&#xD;
interstate commerce in fact, but only whether a “rational&#xD;
basis” exists for so concluding. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 557;&#xD;
see also Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation&#xD;
Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 276–280 (1981); Perez, 402 U. S.,&#xD;
at 155–156; Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294, 299–&#xD;
301 (1964); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States,&#xD;
379 U. S. 241, 252–253 (1964). Given the enforcement&#xD;
difficulties that attend distinguishing between marijuana&#xD;
cultivated locally and marijuana grown elsewhere, 21&#xD;
U. S. C. §801(5), and concerns about diversion into illicit&#xD;
channels,33 we have no difficulty concluding that Congress&#xD;
had a rational basis for believing that failure to regulate&#xD;
the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana&#xD;
would leave a gaping hole in the CSA. Thus, as in&#xD;
Wickard, when it enacted comprehensive legislation to&#xD;
regulate the interstate market in a fungible commodity,&#xD;
Congress was acting well within its authority to “make all&#xD;
Laws which shall be necessary and proper” to “regulate&#xD;
Commerce . . . among the several States.” U. S. Const.,&#xD;
Art. I, §8. That the regulation ensnares some purely&#xD;
intrastate activity is of no moment. As we have done&#xD;
many times before, we refuse to excise individual compo-&#xD;
——————&#xD;
exacting requirement is not only unprecedented, it is also impractical.&#xD;
Indeed, the principal dissent’s critique of Congress for “not even”&#xD;
including “declarations” specific to marijuana is particularly unpersua-&#xD;
sive given that the CSA initially identified 80 other substances subject&#xD;
to regulation as Schedule I drugs, not to mention those categorized in&#xD;
Schedules II–V. Post, at 14 (O’CONNOR, J., dissenting). Surely, Con-&#xD;
gress cannot be expected (and certainly should not be required) to&#xD;
include specific findings on each and every substance contained therein&#xD;
in order to satisfy the dissenters’ unfounded skepticism.&#xD;
  33 See n. 21, supra (citing sources that evince Congress’ particular&#xD;
&#xD;
concern with the diversion of drugs from legitimate to illicit channels).&#xD;

&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
nents of that larger scheme.&#xD;
                              IV&#xD;
  To support their contrary submission, respondents rely&#xD;
heavily on two of our more recent Commerce Clause cases.&#xD;
In their myopic focus, they overlook the larger context of&#xD;
modern-era Commerce Clause jurisprudence preserved by&#xD;
those cases. Moreover, even in the narrow prism of re-&#xD;
spondents’ creation, they read those cases far too broadly.&#xD;
  Those two cases, of course, are Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, and&#xD;
Morrison, 529 U. S. 598. As an initial matter, the statu-&#xD;
tory challenges at issue in those cases were markedly&#xD;
different from the challenge respondents pursue in the&#xD;
case at hand. Here, respondents ask us to excise individ-&#xD;
ual applications of a concededly valid statutory scheme.&#xD;
In contrast, in both Lopez and Morrison, the parties as-&#xD;
serted that a particular statute or provision fell outside&#xD;
Congress’ commerce power in its entirety. This distinction&#xD;
is pivotal for we have often reiterated that “[w]here the&#xD;
class of activities is regulated and that class is within the&#xD;
reach of federal power, the courts have no power ‘to excise,&#xD;
as trivial, individual instances’ of the class.” Perez, 402&#xD;
U. S., at 154 (emphasis deleted) (quoting Wirtz, 392 U. S.,&#xD;
at 193); see also Hodel, 452 U. S., at 308.&#xD;
  At issue in Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, was the validity of the&#xD;
Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which was a brief,&#xD;
single-subject statute making it a crime for an individual to&#xD;
possess a gun in a school zone. 104 Stat. 4844–4845, 18&#xD;
U. S. C. §922(q)(1)(A). The Act did not regulate any eco-&#xD;
nomic activity and did not contain any requirement that&#xD;
the possession of a gun have any connection to past inter-&#xD;
state activity or a predictable impact on future commercial&#xD;
activity. Distinguishing our earlier cases holding that&#xD;
comprehensive regulatory statutes may be validly applied&#xD;
to local conduct that does not, when viewed in isolation,&#xD;
have a significant impact on interstate commerce, we held&#xD;
                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           21&#xD;
&#xD;
                      Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
the statute invalid. We explained:&#xD;
    “Section 922(q) is a criminal statute that by its terms&#xD;
    has nothing to do with ‘commerce’ or any sort of eco-&#xD;
    nomic enterprise, however broadly one might define&#xD;
    those terms. Section 922(q) is not an essential part of&#xD;
    a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the&#xD;
    regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intra-&#xD;
    state activity were regulated. It cannot, therefore, be&#xD;
    sustained under our cases upholding regulations of&#xD;
    activities that arise out of or are connected with a&#xD;
    commercial transaction, which viewed in the aggre-&#xD;
    gate, substantially affects interstate commerce.” 514&#xD;
    U. S., at 561.&#xD;
   The statutory scheme that the Government is defending&#xD;
in this litigation is at the opposite end of the regulatory&#xD;
spectrum. As explained above, the CSA, enacted in 1970&#xD;
as part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and&#xD;
Control Act, 84 Stat. 1242–1284, was a lengthy and de-&#xD;
tailed statute creating a comprehensive framework for&#xD;
regulating the production, distribution, and possession of&#xD;
five classes of “controlled substances.” Most of those&#xD;
substances—those listed in Schedules II through V—“have&#xD;
a useful and legitimate medical purpose and are necessary&#xD;
to maintain the health and general welfare of the Ameri-&#xD;
can people.” 21 U. S. C. §801(1). The regulatory scheme&#xD;
is designed to foster the beneficial use of those medica-&#xD;
tions, to prevent their misuse, and to prohibit entirely the&#xD;
possession or use of substances listed in Schedule I, except&#xD;
as a part of a strictly controlled research project.&#xD;
   While the statute provided for the periodic updating of&#xD;
the five schedules, Congress itself made the initial classifi-&#xD;
cations. It identified 42 opiates, 22 opium derivatives, and&#xD;
17 hallucinogenic substances as Schedule I drugs. 84 Stat.&#xD;
1248. Marijuana was listed as the 10th item in the third&#xD;
subcategory. That classification, unlike the discrete pro-&#xD;

                          Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
hibition established by the Gun-Free School Zones Act of&#xD;
1990, was merely one of many “essential part[s] of a larger&#xD;
regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory&#xD;
scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity&#xD;
were regulated.” Lopez, 514 U. S., at 561.34 Our opinion&#xD;
in Lopez casts no doubt on the validity of such a program.&#xD;
   Nor does this Court’s holding in Morrison, 529 U. S. 598.&#xD;
The Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 1902,&#xD;
created a federal civil remedy for the victims of gender-&#xD;
motivated crimes of violence. 42 U. S. C. §13981. The&#xD;
remedy was enforceable in both state and federal courts,&#xD;
and generally depended on proof of the violation of a state&#xD;
law. Despite congressional findings that such crimes had&#xD;
an adverse impact on interstate commerce, we held the&#xD;
statute unconstitutional because, like the statute in Lopez,&#xD;
it did not regulate economic activity. We concluded that&#xD;
“the noneconomic, criminal nature of the conduct at issue&#xD;
was central to our decision” in Lopez, and that our prior&#xD;
cases had identified a clear pattern of analysis: “ ‘Where&#xD;
economic activity substantially affects interstate com-&#xD;
merce, legislation regulating that activity will be sus-&#xD;
tained.’ ”35 Morrison, 529 U. S., at 610.&#xD;

  34 The principal dissent asserts that by “[s]eizing upon our language&#xD;
in Lopez,” post, at 5 (opinion of O’CONNOR, J.), i.e., giving effect to our&#xD;
well-established case law, Congress will now have an incentive to&#xD;
legislate broadly. Even putting aside the political checks that would&#xD;
generally curb Congress’ power to enact a broad and comprehensive&#xD;
scheme for the purpose of targeting purely local activity, there is no&#xD;
suggestion that the CSA constitutes the type of “evasive” legislation the&#xD;
dissent fears, nor could such an argument plausibly be made. Post, at 6&#xD;

“Economics” refers to “the production, distribution, and&#xD;
consumption of commodities.” Webster’s Third New In-&#xD;
ternational Dictionary 720 (1966). The CSA is a statute&#xD;
that regulates the production, distribution, and consump-&#xD;
tion of commodities for which there is an established, and&#xD;
lucrative, interstate market. Prohibiting the intrastate&#xD;
possession or manufacture of an article of commerce is a&#xD;
rational (and commonly utilized) means of regulating&#xD;
commerce in that product.36 Such prohibitions include&#xD;
specific decisions requiring that a drug be withdrawn from&#xD;
the market as a result of the failure to comply with regula-&#xD;
tory requirements as well as decisions excluding Schedule&#xD;
I drugs entirely from the market. Because the CSA is a&#xD;
statute that directly regulates economic, commercial&#xD;
activity, our opinion in Morrison casts no doubt on its&#xD;
constitutionality.&#xD;
   The Court of Appeals was able to conclude otherwise&#xD;
only by isolating a “separate and distinct” class of activi-&#xD;
ties that it held to be beyond the reach of federal power,&#xD;
defined as “the intrastate, noncommercial cultivation,&#xD;
possession and use of marijuana for personal medical&#xD;
purposes on the advice of a physician and in accordance&#xD;
with state law.” 352 F. 3d, at 1229. The court character-&#xD;
ized this class as “different in kind from drug trafficking.”&#xD;
Id., at 1228. The differences between the members of a&#xD;
class so defined and the principal traffickers in Schedule I&#xD;
substances might be sufficient to justify a policy decision&#xD;
exempting the narrower class from the coverage of the&#xD;
CSA. The question, however, is whether Congress’ con-&#xD;
trary policy judgment, i.e., its decision to include this&#xD;
narrower “class of activities” within the larger regulatory&#xD;

&#xD;
                          Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
scheme, was constitutionally deficient. We have no diffi-&#xD;
culty concluding that Congress acted rationally in deter-&#xD;
mining that none of the characteristics making up the&#xD;
purported class, whether viewed individually or in the&#xD;
aggregate, compelled an exemption from the CSA; rather,&#xD;
the subdivided class of activities defined by the Court of&#xD;
Appeals was an essential part of the larger regulatory&#xD;
scheme.&#xD;
   First, the fact that marijuana is used “for personal&#xD;
medical purposes on the advice of a physician” cannot&#xD;
itself serve as a distinguishing factor. 352 F. 3d, at 1229.&#xD;
The CSA designates marijuana as contraband for any&#xD;
purpose; in fact, by characterizing marijuana as a Sched-&#xD;
ule I drug, Congress expressly found that the drug has no&#xD;
acceptable medical uses. Moreover, the CSA is a compre-&#xD;
hensive regulatory regime specifically designed to regulate&#xD;
which controlled substances can be utilized for medicinal&#xD;
purposes, and in what manner. Indeed, most of the sub-&#xD;
stances classified in the CSA “have a useful and legitimate&#xD;
medical purpose.” 21 U. S. C. §801(1). Thus, even if&#xD;
respondents are correct that marijuana does have ac-&#xD;
cepted medical uses and thus should be redesignated as a&#xD;
lesser schedule drug,37 the CSA would still impose controls&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  37 We  acknowledge that evidence proffered by respondents in this case&#xD;
regarding the effective medical uses for marijuana, if found credible&#xD;
after trial, would cast serious doubt on the accuracy of the findings that&#xD;
require marijuana to be listed in Schedule I. See, e.g., Institute of&#xD;
Medicine, Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base 179 (J.&#xD;
Joy, S. Watson, &amp; J. Benson eds. 1999) (recognizing that “[s]cientific&#xD;
data indicate the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoid drugs,&#xD;
primarily THC [Tetrahydrocannabinol] for pain relief, control of nausea&#xD;
and vomiting, and appetite stimulation”); see also Conant v. Walters,&#xD;
309 F. 3d 629, 640–643 (CA9 2002) (Kozinski, J., concurring) (chroni-&#xD;
cling medical studies recognizing valid medical uses for marijuana and&#xD;
its derivatives). But the possibility that the drug may be reclassified in&#xD;
the future has no relevance to the question whether Congress now has&#xD;
the power to regulate its production and distribution. Respondents’&#xD;

&#xD;
                        Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
beyond what is required by California law. The CSA&#xD;
requires manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, and&#xD;
other handlers of controlled substances to comply with&#xD;
statutory and regulatory provisions mandating registra-&#xD;
tion with the DEA, compliance with specific production&#xD;
quotas, security controls to guard against diversion, re-&#xD;
cordkeeping and reporting obligations, and prescription&#xD;
requirements. See 21 U. S. C. §§821–830; 21 CFR §1301 et&#xD;
seq. (2004). Furthermore, the dispensing of new drugs,&#xD;
even when doctors approve their use, must await federal&#xD;
approval. United States v. Rutherford, 442 U. S. 544&#xD;
(1979). Accordingly, the mere fact that marijuana—like&#xD;
virtually every other controlled substance regulated by the&#xD;
CSA—is used for medicinal purposes cannot possibly serve&#xD;
to distinguish it from the core activities regulated by the&#xD;
CSA.&#xD;
   Nor can it serve as an “objective marke[r]” or “objective&#xD;
facto[r]” to arbitrarily narrow the relevant class as the&#xD;
dissenters suggest, post, at 6 (O’CONNOR, J., dissenting);&#xD;
post, at 12 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). More fundamentally,&#xD;
if, as the principal dissent contends, the personal cultiva-&#xD;
tion, possession, and use of marijuana for medicinal pur-&#xD;
poses is beyond the “ ‘outer limits’ of Congress’ Commerce&#xD;
Clause authority,” post, at 1 (O’CONNOR, J., dissenting), it&#xD;
must also be true that such personal use of marijuana (or&#xD;
any other homegrown drug) for recreational purposes is&#xD;
also beyond those “ ‘outer limits,’ ” whether or not a State&#xD;
elects to authorize or even regulate such use. JUSTICE&#xD;
THOMAS’ separate dissent suffers from the same sweeping&#xD;
implications. That is, the dissenters’ rationale logically&#xD;
extends to place any federal regulation (including quality,&#xD;
prescription, or quantity controls) of any locally cultivated&#xD;
and possessed controlled substance for any purpose be-&#xD;
—————— &#xD;
&#xD;
submission, if accepted, would place all homegrown medical substances&#xD;
&#xD;
beyond the reach of Congress’ regulatory jurisdiction. &#xD;
&#xD;
26                  GONZALES v. RAICH&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
yond the “ ‘outer limits’ ” of Congress’ Commerce Clause&#xD;
authority. One need not have a degree in economics to&#xD;
understand why a nationwide exemption for the vast&#xD;
quantity of marijuana (or other drugs) locally cultivated&#xD;
for personal use (which presumably would include use by&#xD;
friends, neighbors, and family members) may have a&#xD;
substantial impact on the interstate market for this ex-&#xD;
traordinarily popular substance. The congressional judg-&#xD;
ment that an exemption for such a significant segment of&#xD;
the total market would undermine the orderly enforce-&#xD;
ment of the entire regulatory scheme is entitled to a&#xD;
strong presumption of validity. Indeed, that judgment is&#xD;
not only rational, but “visible to the naked eye,” Lopez, 514&#xD;
U. S., at 563, under any commonsense appraisal of the&#xD;
probable consequences of such an open-ended exemption.&#xD;
   Second, limiting the activity to marijuana possession&#xD;
and cultivation “in accordance with state law” cannot&#xD;
serve to place respondents’ activities beyond congressional&#xD;
reach. The Supremacy Clause unambiguously provides&#xD;
that if there is any conflict between federal and state law,&#xD;
federal law shall prevail. It is beyond peradventure that&#xD;
federal power over commerce is “ ‘superior to that of the&#xD;
States to provide for the welfare or necessities of their&#xD;
inhabitants,’ ” however legitimate or dire those necessities&#xD;
may be. Wirtz, 392 U. S., at 196 (quoting Sanitary Dist. of&#xD;
Chicago v. United States, 266 U. S. 405, 426 (1925)). See&#xD;
also 392 U. S., at 195–196; Wickard, 317 U. S., at 124&#xD;
(“ ‘[N]o form of state activity can constitutionally thwart&#xD;
the regulatory power granted by the commerce clause to&#xD;
Congress’ ”). Just as state acquiescence to federal regula-&#xD;
tion cannot expand the bounds of the Commerce Clause,&#xD;
see, e.g., Morrison, 529 U. S., at 661–662 (BREYER, J.,&#xD;
dissenting) (noting that 38 States requested federal inter-&#xD;
vention), so too state action cannot circumscribe Congress’&#xD;
plenary commerce power. See United States v. Darby, 312&#xD;
U. S. 100, 114 (1941) (“That power can neither be enlarged&#xD;
                      Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                    27&#xD;

&#xD;
nor diminished by the exercise or non-exercise of state&#xD;
power”).38&#xD;
   Respondents acknowledge this proposition, but nonethe-&#xD;
less contend that their activities were not “an essential&#xD;
part of a larger regulatory scheme” because they had been&#xD;
“isolated by the State of California, and [are] policed by&#xD;
the State of California,” and thus remain “entirely sepa-&#xD;
rated from the market.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 27. The dissent-&#xD;
ers fall prey to similar reasoning. See n. 38, supra this&#xD;
page. The notion that California law has surgically ex-&#xD;
——————&#xD;
   38 That is so even if California’s current controls (enacted eight years&#xD;
&#xD;
after the Compassionate Use Act was passed) are “[e]ffective,” as the&#xD;
dissenters would have us blindly presume, post, at 15 (O’CONNOR, J.,&#xD;
dissenting); post, at 6, 12 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). California’s decision&#xD;
(made 34 years after the CSA was enacted) to impose “stric[t] controls”&#xD;
on the “cultivation and possession of marijuana for medical purposes,”&#xD;
post, at 6 (THOMAS, J., dissenting), cannot retroactively divest Congress&#xD;
of its authority under the Commerce Clause. Indeed, JUSTICE THOMAS’&#xD;
urgings to the contrary would turn the Supremacy Clause on its head,&#xD;
and would resurrect limits on congressional power that have long since&#xD;
been rejected. See post, at 8 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment)&#xD;
(quoting McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 424 (1819)) (“ ‘To impose&#xD;
on [Congress] the necessity of resorting to means which it cannot control,&#xD;
which another government may furnish or withhold, would render its&#xD;
course precarious, the result of its measures uncertain, and create a&#xD;
dependence on other governments, which might disappoint its most&#xD;
important designs, and is incompatible with the language of the constitu-&#xD;
tion’ ”).&#xD;
   Moreover, in addition to casting aside more than a century of this&#xD;
Court’s Commerce Clause jurisprudence, it is noteworthy that JUSTICE&#xD;
THOMAS’ suggestion that States possess the power to dictate the extent of&#xD;
Congress’ commerce power would have far-reaching implications beyond&#xD;
the facts of this case. For example, under his reasoning, Congress would&#xD;
be equally powerless to regulate, let alone prohibit, the intrastate&#xD;
possession, cultivation, and use of marijuana for recreational purposes,&#xD;
an activity which all States “strictly contro[l].” Indeed, his rationale&#xD;
seemingly would require Congress to cede its constitutional power to&#xD;
regulate commerce whenever a State opts to exercise its “traditional&#xD;
police powers to define the criminal law and to protect the health,&#xD;
safety, and welfare of their citizens.” Post, at 9–10 (dissenting opinion).&#xD;
28                        GONZALES v. RAICH&#xD;
&#xD;
                           Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
cised a discrete activity that is hermetically sealed off&#xD;
from the larger interstate marijuana market is a dubious&#xD;
proposition, and, more importantly, one that Congress&#xD;
could have rationally rejected.&#xD;
   Indeed, that the California exemptions will have a sig-&#xD;
nificant impact on both the supply and demand sides of&#xD;
the market for marijuana is not just “plausible” as the&#xD;
principal dissent concedes, post, at 16 (O’CONNOR, J.,&#xD;
dissenting), it is readily apparent. The exemption for&#xD;
physicians provides them with an economic incentive to&#xD;
grant their patients permission to use the drug. In contrast&#xD;
to most prescriptions for legal drugs, which limit the dosage&#xD;
and duration of the usage, under California law the doctor’s&#xD;
permission to recommend marijuana use is open-ended.&#xD;
The authority to grant permission whenever the doctor&#xD;
determines that a patient is afflicted with “any other illness&#xD;
for which marijuana provides relief,” Cal. Health &amp; Safety&#xD;
Code Ann. §11362.5(b)(1)(A) (West Supp. 2005), is broad&#xD;
enough to allow even the most scrupulous doctor to conclude&#xD;
that some recreational uses would be therapeutic.39 And&#xD;
our cases have taught us that there are some unscrupulous&#xD;
physicians who overprescribe when it is sufficiently profit-&#xD;
able to do so.40&#xD;
   The exemption for cultivation by patients and caregivers&#xD;
can only increase the supply of marijuana in the California&#xD;
market.41 The likelihood that all such production will&#xD;

harm to the patient’s safety or physical or mental health.” Cal. Health&#xD;

&#xD;
promptly terminate when patients recover or will precisely&#xD;
match the patients’ medical needs during their convales-&#xD;
cence seems remote; whereas the danger that excesses will&#xD;
satisfy some of the admittedly enormous demand for recrea-&#xD;
tional use seems obvious.42 Moreover, that the national and&#xD;
international narcotics trade has thrived in the face of&#xD;
vigorous criminal enforcement efforts suggests that no small&#xD;
number of unscrupulous people will make use of the Cali-&#xD;
fornia exemptions to serve their commercial ends whenever&#xD;
it is feasible to do so.43 Taking into account the fact that&#xD;

dried marijuana, and to cultivate up to 6 mature or 12 immature&#xD;
plants. Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. §11362.77(a) (West Supp.&#xD;
2005). However, the quantity limitations serve only as a floor. Based&#xD;
on a doctor’s recommendation, a patient can possess whatever quantity&#xD;
is necessary to satisfy his medical needs, and cities and counties are&#xD;
given carte blanche to establish more generous limits. Indeed, several&#xD;
cities and counties have done just that. For example, patients residing&#xD;
in the cities of Oakland and Santa Cruz and in the counties of Sonoma&#xD;
and Tehama are permitted to possess up to 3 pounds of processed&#xD;
marijuana. Reply Brief for United States 19 (citing Proposition 215&#xD;
Enforcement Guidelines). Putting that quantity in perspective, 3&#xD;
pounds of marijuana yields roughly 3,000 joints or cigarettes. Execu-&#xD;

&#xD;
                      Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
California is only one of at least nine States to have author-&#xD;
ized the medical use of marijuana, a fact JUSTICE&#xD;
O’CONNOR’s dissent conveniently disregards in arguing that&#xD;
the demonstrated effect on commerce while admittedly&#xD;
“plausible” is ultimately “unsubstantiated,” post, at 14, 16,&#xD;
Congress could have rationally concluded that the aggre-&#xD;
gate impact on the national market of all the transactions&#xD;
exempted from federal supervision is unquestionably&#xD;
substantial.&#xD;
  So, from the “separate and distinct” class of activities&#xD;
identified by the Court of Appeals (and adopted by the&#xD;
dissenters), we are left with “the intrastate, noncommer-&#xD;
cial cultivation, possession and use of marijuana.” 352&#xD;
F. 3d, at 1229. Thus the case for the exemption comes&#xD;
down to the claim that a locally cultivated product that is&#xD;
used domestically rather than sold on the open market is&#xD;
not subject to federal regulation. Given the findings in the&#xD;
CSA and the undisputed magnitude of the commercial&#xD;
market for marijuana, our decisions in Wickard v. Filburn&#xD;
and the later cases endorsing its reasoning foreclose that&#xD;
claim.&#xD;
                             V&#xD;
  Respondents also raise a substantive due process claim&#xD;
and seek to avail themselves of the medical necessity&#xD;
defense. These theories of relief were set forth in their&#xD;
complaint but were not reached by the Court of Appeals.&#xD;
We therefore do not address the question whether judicial&#xD;
relief is available to respondents on these alternative&#xD;
bases. We do note, however, the presence of another&#xD;
avenue of relief. As the Solicitor General confirmed dur-&#xD;
ing oral argument, the statute authorizes procedures for&#xD;
the reclassification of Schedule I drugs. But perhaps even&#xD;
more important than these legal avenues is the democratic&#xD;

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&#xD;
            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&#xD;
                        [June 6, 2005]&#xD;
&#xD;
   JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.&#xD;
   I agree with the Court’s holding that the Controlled&#xD;
Substances Act (CSA) may validly be applied to respon-&#xD;
dents’ cultivation, distribution, and possession of mari-&#xD;
juana for personal, medicinal use. I write separately&#xD;
because my understanding of the doctrinal foundation on&#xD;
which that holding rests is, if not inconsistent with that of&#xD;
the Court, at least more nuanced.&#xD;
   Since Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146 (1971), our&#xD;
cases have mechanically recited that the Commerce&#xD;
Clause permits congressional regulation of three catego-&#xD;
ries: (1) the channels of interstate commerce; (2) the in-&#xD;
strumentalities of interstate commerce, and persons or&#xD;
things in interstate commerce; and (3) activities that&#xD;
“substantially affect” interstate commerce. Id., at 150; see&#xD;
United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 608–609 (2000);&#xD;
United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 558–559 (1995); Hodel&#xD;
v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452&#xD;
U. S. 264, 276–277 (1981). The first two categories are self-&#xD;
evident, since they are the ingredients of interstate com-&#xD;
merce itself. See Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 189–190&#xD;
(1824). The third category, however, is different in kind,&#xD;
and its recitation without explanation is misleading and&#xD;
incomplete.&#xD;
   It is misleading because, unlike the channels, instru-&#xD;

&#xD;
mentalities, and agents of interstate commerce, activities&#xD;
that substantially affect interstate commerce are not&#xD;
themselves part of interstate commerce, and thus the&#xD;
power to regulate them cannot come from the Commerce&#xD;
Clause alone. Rather, as this Court has acknowledged&#xD;
since at least United States v. Coombs, 12 Pet. 72 (1838),&#xD;
Congress’s regulatory authority over intrastate activities&#xD;
that are not themselves part of interstate commerce (in-&#xD;
cluding activities that have a substantial effect on inter-&#xD;
state commerce) derives from the Necessary and Proper&#xD;
Clause. Id., at 78; Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294,&#xD;
301–302 (1964); United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., 315&#xD;
U. S. 110, 119 (1942); Shreveport Rate Cases, 234 U. S. 342,&#xD;
353 (1914); United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1,&#xD;
39–40 (1895) (Harlan, J., dissenting).1 And the category of&#xD;
“activities that substantially affect interstate commerce,”&#xD;
Lopez, supra, at 559, is incomplete because the authority to&#xD;
enact laws necessary and proper for the regulation of&#xD;
interstate commerce is not limited to laws governing&#xD;
intrastate activities that substantially affect interstate&#xD;
commerce. Where necessary to make a regulation of&#xD;
interstate commerce effective, Congress may regulate even&#xD;
those intrastate activities that do not themselves substan-&#xD;
tially affect interstate commerce.&#xD;
                            I&#xD;
   Our cases show that the regulation of intrastate activi-&#xD;
ties may be necessary to and proper for the regulation of&#xD;
interstate commerce in two general circumstances. Most&#xD;
directly, the commerce power permits Congress not only to&#xD;
devise rules for the governance of commerce between&#xD;

on the ground that the regulated activities had a substan-&#xD;
tial effect on interstate commerce. See, e.g., Hodel, supra,&#xD;
at 281 (surface coal mining); Katzenbach, supra, at 300&#xD;
(discrimination by restaurants); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc.&#xD;
v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 258 (1964) (discrimination&#xD;
by hotels); Mandeville Island Farms v. American Crystal&#xD;
Sugar Co., 334 U. S. 219, 237 (1948) (intrastate price-&#xD;
fixing); Board of Trade of Chicago v. Olsen, 262 U. S. 1, 40&#xD;
(1923) (activities of a local grain exchange); Stafford v.&#xD;
Wallace, 258 U. S. 495, 517, 524–525 (1922) (intrastate&#xD;
transactions at stockyard). Lopez and Morrison recognized&#xD;
the expansive scope of Congress’s authority in this regard:&#xD;
“[T]he pattern is clear. Where economic activity substan-&#xD;
tially affects interstate commerce, legislation regulating&#xD;
that activity will be sustained.” Lopez, supra, at 560;&#xD;
Morrison, supra, at 610 (same).&#xD;
   This principle is not without limitation. In Lopez and&#xD;
Morrison, the Court—conscious of the potential of the&#xD;
“substantially affects” test to “ ‘obliterate the distinction&#xD;
between what is national and what is local,’ ” Lopez, supra,&#xD;
at 566–567 (quoting A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v.&#xD;
United States, 295 U. S. 495, 554 (1935)); see also Morrison,&#xD;
supra, at 615–616—rejected the argument that Congress&#xD;
may regulate noneconomic activity based solely on the&#xD;
effect that it may have on interstate commerce through a&#xD;
remote chain of inferences. Lopez, supra, at 564–566;&#xD;
Morrison, supra, at 617–618. “[I]f we were to accept [such]&#xD;
arguments,” the Court reasoned in Lopez, “we are hard&#xD;
pressed to posit any activity by an individual that Con-&#xD;
gress is without power to regulate.” Lopez, supra, at 564;&#xD;
see also Morrison, supra, at 615–616. Thus, although&#xD;
4                       GONZALES v. RAICH&#xD;
&#xD;
                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
Congress’s authority to regulate intrastate activity that&#xD;
substantially affects interstate commerce is broad, it does&#xD;
not permit the Court to “pile inference upon inference,”&#xD;
Lopez, supra, at 567, in order to establish that none-&#xD;
conomic activity has a substantial effect on interstate&#xD;
commerce.&#xD;
  As we implicitly acknowledged in Lopez, however, Con-&#xD;
gress’s authority to enact laws necessary and proper for&#xD;
the regulation of interstate commerce is not limited to&#xD;
laws directed against economic activities that have a&#xD;
substantial effect on interstate commerce. Though the&#xD;
conduct in Lopez was not economic, the Court nevertheless&#xD;
recognized that it could be regulated as “an essential part&#xD;
of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the&#xD;
regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate&#xD;
activity were regulated.” 514 U. S., at 561. This state-&#xD;
ment referred to those cases permitting the regulation of&#xD;
intrastate activities “which in a substantial way interfere&#xD;
with or obstruct the exercise of the granted power.”&#xD;
Wrightwood Dairy Co., 315 U. S., at 119; see also United&#xD;
States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 118–119 (1941); Shreveport&#xD;
Rate Cases, 234 U. S., at 353. As the Court put it in&#xD;
Wrightwood Dairy, where Congress has the authority to&#xD;
enact a regulation of interstate commerce, “it possesses&#xD;
every power needed to make that regulation effective.”&#xD;
315 U. S., at 118–119.&#xD;
  Although this power “to make . . . regulation effective”&#xD;
commonly overlaps with the authority to regulate eco-&#xD;
nomic activities that substantially affect interstate com-&#xD;
merce,2 and may in some cases have been confused with&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  2 Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942), presented such a case.&#xD;
&#xD;
Because the unregulated production of wheat for personal consumption&#xD;
diminished demand in the regulated wheat market, the Court said, it&#xD;
carried with it the potential to disrupt Congress’s price regulation by&#xD;
driving down prices in the market. Id., at 127–129. This potential&#xD;
disruption of Congress’s interstate regulation, and not only the effect&#xD;
                   Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)              5&#xD;
&#xD;
                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
that authority, the two are distinct. The regulation of an&#xD;
intrastate activity may be essential to a comprehensive&#xD;
regulation of interstate commerce even though the intra-&#xD;
state activity does not itself “substantially affect” inter-&#xD;
state commerce. Moreover, as the passage from Lopez&#xD;
quoted above suggests, Congress may regulate even none-&#xD;
conomic local activity if that regulation is a necessary part&#xD;
of a more general regulation of interstate commerce. See&#xD;
Lopez, supra, at 561. The relevant question is simply&#xD;
whether the means chosen are “reasonably adapted” to the&#xD;
attainment of a legitimate end under the commerce power.&#xD;
See Darby, supra, at 121.&#xD;
  In Darby, for instance, the Court explained that “Con-&#xD;
gress, having . . . adopted the policy of excluding from&#xD;
interstate commerce all goods produced for the commerce&#xD;
which do not conform to the specified labor standards,”&#xD;
312 U. S., at 121, could not only require employers en-&#xD;
gaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce&#xD;
to conform to wage and hour standards, id., at 119–121,&#xD;
but could also require those employers to keep employ-&#xD;
ment records in order to demonstrate compliance with the&#xD;
regulatory scheme, id., at 125. While the Court sustained&#xD;
the former regulation on the alternative ground that the&#xD;
activity it regulated could have a “great effect” on inter-&#xD;
state commerce, id., at 122–123, it affirmed the latter on&#xD;
the sole ground that “[t]he requirement for records even of&#xD;
the intrastate transaction is an appropriate means to a&#xD;
legitimate end,” id., at 125.&#xD;
  As the Court said in the Shreveport Rate Cases, the&#xD;
Necessary and Proper Clause does not give “Congress . . .&#xD;
the authority to regulate the internal commerce of a State,&#xD;
as such,” but it does allow Congress “to take all measures&#xD;
necessary or appropriate to” the effective regulation of the&#xD;
——————&#xD;
that personal consumption of wheat had on interstate commerce,&#xD;
justified Congress’s regulation of that conduct. Id., at 128–129.&#xD;

may thereby be controlled.” 234 U. S., at 353; see also&#xD;

the Shreveport Rate Cases is not limited to instrumentali-&#xD;
ties of commerce).&#xD;
                              II&#xD;
   Today’s principal dissent objects that, by permitting&#xD;
Congress to regulate activities necessary to effective inter-&#xD;
state regulation, the Court reduces Lopez and Morrison to&#xD;
“little more than a drafting guide.” Post, at 5 (opinion of&#xD;
O’CONNOR, J.). I think that criticism unjustified. Unlike&#xD;
the power to regulate activities that have a substantial&#xD;
effect on interstate commerce, the power to enact laws&#xD;
enabling effective regulation of interstate commerce can&#xD;
only be exercised in conjunction with congressional regula-&#xD;
tion of an interstate market, and it extends only to those&#xD;
measures necessary to make the interstate regulation&#xD;
effective. As Lopez itself states, and the Court affirms&#xD;
today, Congress may regulate noneconomic intrastate&#xD;
activities only where the failure to do so “could . . . under-&#xD;
cut” its regulation of interstate commerce. See Lopez,&#xD;
supra, at 561; ante, at 15, 21, 22. This is not a power that&#xD;
threatens to obliterate the line between “what is truly&#xD;
national and what is truly local.” Lopez, supra, at 567–&#xD;
568.&#xD;
   Lopez and Morrison affirm that Congress may not regu-&#xD;
late certain “purely local” activity within the States based&#xD;
solely on the attenuated effect that such activity may have&#xD;
in the interstate market. But those decisions do not de-&#xD;
clare noneconomic intrastate activities to be categorically&#xD;
beyond the reach of the Federal Government. Neither&#xD;
case involved the power of Congress to exert control over&#xD;
intrastate activities in connection with a more comprehen-&#xD;
sive scheme of regulation; Lopez expressly disclaimed that&#xD;
it was such a case, 514 U. S., at 561, and Morrison did not&#xD;
                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            7&#xD;
&#xD;
                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
even discuss the possibility that it was. (The Court of&#xD;
Appeals in Morrison made clear that it was not. See&#xD;
Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic Inst., 169 F. 3d 820,&#xD;
834–835 (CA4 1999) (en banc).) To dismiss this distinction&#xD;
as “superficial and formalistic,” see post, at 6 (O’CONNOR,&#xD;
J., dissenting), is to misunderstand the nature of the&#xD;
Necessary and Proper Clause, which empowers Congress&#xD;
to enact laws in effectuation of its enumerated powers that&#xD;
are not within its authority to enact in isolation. See&#xD;
McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421–422 (1819).&#xD;
   And there are other restraints upon the Necessary and&#xD;
Proper Clause authority. As Chief Justice Marshall wrote&#xD;
in McCulloch v. Maryland, even when the end is constitu-&#xD;
tional and legitimate, the means must be “appropriate”&#xD;
and “plainly adapted” to that end. Id., at 421. Moreover,&#xD;
they may not be otherwise “prohibited” and must be “con-&#xD;
sistent with the letter and spirit of the constitution.” Ibid.&#xD;
These phrases are not merely hortatory. For example,&#xD;
cases such as Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898 (1997),&#xD;
and New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992),&#xD;
affirm that a law is not “ ‘proper for carrying into Execu-&#xD;
tion the Commerce Clause’ ” “[w]hen [it] violates [a consti-&#xD;
tutional] principle of state sovereignty.” Printz, supra, at&#xD;
923–924; see also New York, supra, at 166.&#xD;
                             III&#xD;
   The application of these principles to the case before us&#xD;
is straightforward. In the CSA, Congress has undertaken&#xD;
to extinguish the interstate market in Schedule I con-&#xD;
trolled substances, including marijuana. The Commerce&#xD;
Clause unquestionably permits this. The power to regu-&#xD;
late interstate commerce “extends not only to those regu-&#xD;
lations which aid, foster and protect the commerce, but&#xD;
embraces those which prohibit it.” Darby, 312 U. S., at&#xD;
113. See also Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, 220 U. S.&#xD;
45, 58 (1911); Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 354 (1903). To&#xD;
8                        GONZALES v. RAICH&#xD;
&#xD;
                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
effectuate its objective, Congress has prohibited almost all&#xD;
intrastate activities related to Schedule I substances—&#xD;
both economic activities (manufacture, distribution, pos-&#xD;
session with the intent to distribute) and noneconomic&#xD;
activities (simple possession). See 21 U. S. C. §§841(a),&#xD;
844(a). That simple possession is a noneconomic activity&#xD;
is immaterial to whether it can be prohibited as a neces-&#xD;
sary part of a larger regulation. Rather, Congress’s au-&#xD;
thority to enact all of these prohibitions of intrastate&#xD;
controlled-substance activities depends only upon whether&#xD;
they are appropriate means of achieving the legitimate&#xD;
end of eradicating Schedule I substances from interstate&#xD;
commerce.&#xD;
   By this measure, I think the regulation must be sus-&#xD;
tained. Not only is it impossible to distinguish “controlled&#xD;
substances manufactured and distributed intrastate” from&#xD;
“controlled substances manufactured and distributed&#xD;
interstate,” but it hardly makes sense to speak in such&#xD;
terms. Drugs like marijuana are fungible commodities.&#xD;
As the Court explains, marijuana that is grown at home&#xD;
and possessed for personal use is never more than an&#xD;
instant from the interstate market—and this is so&#xD;
whether or not the possession is for medicinal use or law-&#xD;
ful use under the laws of a particular State.3 See ante, at&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  3 The principal dissent claims that, if this is sufficient to sustain the&#xD;
&#xD;
regulation at issue in this case, then it should also have been sufficient&#xD;
to sustain the regulation at issue in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S.&#xD;
549 (1995). See post, at 11–12 (arguing that “we could have surmised&#xD;
in Lopez that guns in school zones are ‘never more than an instant from&#xD;
the interstate market’ in guns already subject to federal regulation,&#xD;
recast Lopez as a Necessary and Proper Clause case, and thereby&#xD;
upheld the Gun-Free School Zones Act”). This claim founders upon the&#xD;
shoals of Lopez itself, which made clear that the statute there at issue&#xD;
was “not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity.”&#xD;
Lopez, supra, at 561 (emphasis added). On the dissent’s view of things,&#xD;
that statement is inexplicable. Of course it is in addition difficult to&#xD;
imagine what intelligible scheme of regulation of the interstate market&#xD;
                     Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                    9&#xD;
&#xD;
                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
23–30. Congress need not accept on faith that state law&#xD;
will be effective in maintaining a strict division between a&#xD;
lawful market for “medical” marijuana and the more&#xD;
general marijuana market. See id., at 26–27, and n. 38.&#xD;
“To impose on [Congress] the necessity of resorting to&#xD;
means which it cannot control, which another government&#xD;
may furnish or withhold, would render its course precari-&#xD;
ous, the result of its measures uncertain, and create a&#xD;
dependence on other governments, which might disap-&#xD;
point its most important designs, and is incompatible with&#xD;
the language of the constitution.” McCulloch, supra, at&#xD;
424.&#xD;
   Finally, neither respondents nor the dissenters suggest&#xD;
any violation of state sovereignty of the sort that would&#xD;
render this regulation “inappropriate,” id., at 421—except&#xD;
to argue that the CSA regulates an area typically left to&#xD;
state regulation.     See post, at 6–7, 11 (opinion of&#xD;
O’CONNOR, J.); post, at 8–9 (opinion of THOMAS, J.); Brief&#xD;
for Respondents 39–42. That is not enough to render&#xD;
federal regulation an inappropriate means. The Court has&#xD;
repeatedly recognized that, if authorized by the commerce&#xD;
power, Congress may regulate private endeavors “even&#xD;
when [that regulation] may pre-empt express state-law&#xD;
determinations contrary to the result which has com-&#xD;
mended itself to the collective wisdom of Congress.” Na-&#xD;
tional League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833, 840 (1976);&#xD;

in guns could have as an appropriate means of effectuation the prohibi-&#xD;
tion of guns within 1000 feet of schools (and nowhere else). The dissent&#xD;
points to a federal law, 18 U. S. C. §922(b)(1), barring licensed dealers&#xD;
from selling guns to minors, see post, at 12, but the relationship be-&#xD;
tween the regulatory scheme of which §922(b)(1) is a part (requiring all&#xD;
dealers in firearms that have traveled in interstate commerce to be&#xD;
licensed, see §922(a)) and the statute at issue in Lopez approaches the&#xD;
nonexistent—which is doubtless why the Government did not attempt&#xD;
to justify the statute on the basis of that relationship.&#xD;

McCulloch, supra, at 424. At bottom, respondents’ state-&#xD;
sovereignty argument reduces to the contention that&#xD;
federal regulation of the activities permitted by Califor-&#xD;
nia’s Compassionate Use Act is not sufficiently necessary&#xD;
to be “necessary and proper” to Congress’s regulation of&#xD;
the interstate market. For the reasons given above and in&#xD;
the Court’s opinion, I cannot agree.&#xD;
                        *     *     *&#xD;
  I thus agree with the Court that, however the class of&#xD;
regulated activities is subdivided, Congress could rea-&#xD;
sonably conclude that its objective of prohibiting mari-&#xD;
juana from the interstate market “could be undercut” if&#xD;
those activities were excepted from its general scheme of&#xD;
regulation. See Lopez, 514 U. S., at 561. That is sufficient&#xD;
to authorize the application of the CSA to respondents.&#xD;

&#xD;
   JUSTICE O’CONNOR, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and&#xD;
JUSTICE THOMAS join as to all but Part III, dissenting.&#xD;
   We enforce the “outer limits” of Congress’ Commerce&#xD;
Clause authority not for their own sake, but to protect&#xD;
historic spheres of state sovereignty from excessive federal&#xD;
encroachment and thereby to maintain the distribution of&#xD;
power fundamental to our federalist system of govern-&#xD;
ment. United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 557 (1995);&#xD;
NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 37&#xD;
(1937). One of federalism’s chief virtues, of course, is that&#xD;
it promotes innovation by allowing for the possibility that&#xD;
“a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve&#xD;
as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experi-&#xD;
ments without risk to the rest of the country.” New State&#xD;
Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis,&#xD;
J., dissenting).&#xD;
   This case exemplifies the role of States as laboratories.&#xD;
The States’ core police powers have always included au-&#xD;
thority to define criminal law and to protect the health,&#xD;
safety, and welfare of their citizens. Brecht v. Abraham-&#xD;

589, 603, n. 30 (1977). Exercising those powers, California&#xD;

able to relieve severe pain and suffering. Today the Court&#xD;
sanctions an application of the federal Controlled Sub-&#xD;
stances Act that extinguishes that experiment, without&#xD;
any proof that the personal cultivation, possession, and&#xD;
use of marijuana for medicinal purposes, if economic&#xD;
activity in the first place, has a substantial effect on inter-&#xD;
state commerce and is therefore an appropriate subject of&#xD;
federal regulation. In so doing, the Court announces a&#xD;
rule that gives Congress a perverse incentive to legislate&#xD;
broadly pursuant to the Commerce Clause—nestling&#xD;
questionable assertions of its authority into comprehen-&#xD;
sive regulatory schemes—rather than with precision.&#xD;
That rule and the result it produces in this case are irrec-&#xD;
oncilable with our decisions in Lopez, supra, and United&#xD;
States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000). Accordingly I&#xD;
dissent.&#xD;
                              I&#xD;
    In Lopez, we considered the constitutionality of the Gun-&#xD;
Free School Zones Act of 1990, which made it a federal&#xD;
offense “for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm&#xD;
. . . at a place the individual knows, or has reasonable&#xD;
cause to believe, is a school zone,” 18 U. S. C.&#xD;
§922(q)(2)(A). We explained that “Congress’ commerce&#xD;
authority includes the power to regulate those activities&#xD;
having a substantial relation to interstate commerce . . . ,&#xD;
i.e., those activities that substantially affect interstate&#xD;
commerce.” 514 U. S., at 558–559 (citation omitted). This&#xD;
power derives from the conjunction of the Commerce&#xD;
Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause. Garcia v.&#xD;

essary and Proper Clause, and that “the reasoning of these&#xD;
cases underlies every recent decision concerning the reach&#xD;
of Congress to activities affecting interstate commerce”);&#xD;
ante, at 2 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). We held in&#xD;
Lopez that the Gun-Free School Zones Act could not be&#xD;
sustained as an exercise of that power.&#xD;
   Our decision about whether gun possession in school&#xD;
zones substantially affected interstate commerce turned&#xD;
on four considerations. Lopez, supra, at 559–567; see also&#xD;
Morrison, supra, at 609–613. First, we observed that our&#xD;
“substantial effects” cases generally have upheld federal&#xD;
regulation of economic activity that affected interstate&#xD;
commerce, but that §922(q) was a criminal statute having&#xD;
“nothing to do with ‘commerce’ or any sort of economic&#xD;
enterprise.” Lopez, 514 U. S., at 561. In this regard, we&#xD;
also noted that “[s]ection 922(q) is not an essential part of&#xD;
a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the&#xD;
regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate&#xD;
activity were regulated. It cannot, therefore, be sustained&#xD;
under our cases upholding regulations of activities that&#xD;
arise out of or are connected with a commercial transac-&#xD;
tion, which viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects&#xD;
interstate commerce.” Ibid. Second, we noted that the&#xD;
statute contained no express jurisdictional requirement&#xD;
establishing its connection to interstate commerce. Ibid.&#xD;
   Third, we found telling the absence of legislative find-&#xD;
ings about the regulated conduct’s impact on interstate&#xD;
commerce. We explained that while express legislative&#xD;
findings are neither required nor, when provided, disposi-&#xD;
tive, findings “enable us to evaluate the legislative judg-&#xD;
ment that the activity in question substantially affect[s]&#xD;
interstate commerce, even though no such substantial&#xD;
effect [is] visible to the naked eye.” Id., at 563. Finally,&#xD;
we rejected as too attenuated the Government’s argument&#xD;
that firearm possession in school zones could result in&#xD;
violent crime which in turn could adversely affect the&#xD;
4                  GONZALES v. RAICH&#xD;
&#xD;
                   O’CONNOR, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
national economy. Id., at 563–567. The Constitution, we&#xD;
said, does not tolerate reasoning that would “convert&#xD;
congressional authority under the Commerce Clause to a&#xD;
general police power of the sort retained by the States.”&#xD;
Id., at 567. Later in Morrison, supra, we relied on the&#xD;
same four considerations to hold that §40302 of the Vio-&#xD;
lence Against Women Act of 1994, 42 U. S. C. §13981,&#xD;
exceeded Congress’ authority under the Commerce Clause.&#xD;
  In my view, the case before us is materially indistin-&#xD;
guishable from Lopez and Morrison when the same con-&#xD;
siderations are taken into account.&#xD;
                             II&#xD;
                             A&#xD;
  What is the relevant conduct subject to Commerce&#xD;
Clause analysis in this case? The Court takes its cues&#xD;
from Congress, applying the above considerations to the&#xD;
activity regulated by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA)&#xD;
in general. The Court’s decision rests on two facts about&#xD;
the CSA: (1) Congress chose to enact a single statute&#xD;
providing a comprehensive prohibition on the production,&#xD;
distribution, and possession of all controlled substances,&#xD;
and (2) Congress did not distinguish between various&#xD;
forms of intrastate noncommercial cultivation, possession,&#xD;
and use of marijuana. See 21 U. S. C. §§841(a)(1), 844(a).&#xD;
Today’s decision suggests that the federal regulation of&#xD;
local activity is immune to Commerce Clause challenge&#xD;
because Congress chose to act with an ambitious, all-&#xD;
encompassing statute, rather than piecemeal. In my view,&#xD;
allowing Congress to set the terms of the constitutional&#xD;
debate in this way, i.e., by packaging regulation of local&#xD;
activity in broader schemes, is tantamount to removing&#xD;
meaningful limits on the Commerce Clause.&#xD;
  The Court’s principal means of distinguishing Lopez&#xD;
from this case is to observe that the Gun-Free School&#xD;
Zones Act of 1990 was a “brief, single-subject statute,”&#xD;
                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            5&#xD;

&#xD;
ante, at 20, see also ante, at 19, whereas the CSA is “a&#xD;
lengthy and detailed statute creating a comprehensive&#xD;
framework for regulating the production, distribution, and&#xD;
possession of five classes of ‘controlled substances,’ ” ibid.&#xD;
Thus, according to the Court, it was possible in Lopez to&#xD;
evaluate in isolation the constitutionality of criminalizing&#xD;
local activity (there gun possession in school zones),&#xD;
whereas the local activity that the CSA targets (in this&#xD;
case cultivation and possession of marijuana for personal&#xD;
medicinal use) cannot be separated from the general drug&#xD;
control scheme of which it is a part.&#xD;
  Today’s decision allows Congress to regulate intrastate&#xD;
activity without check, so long as there is some implication&#xD;
by legislative design that regulating intrastate activity is&#xD;
essential (and the Court appears to equate “essential” with&#xD;
“necessary”) to the interstate regulatory scheme. Seizing&#xD;
upon our language in Lopez that the statute prohibiting&#xD;
gun possession in school zones was “not an essential part&#xD;
of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the&#xD;
regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate&#xD;
activity were regulated,” 514 U. S., at 561, the Court&#xD;
appears to reason that the placement of local activity in a&#xD;
comprehensive scheme confirms that it is essential to that&#xD;
scheme. Ante, at 21–22. If the Court is right, then Lopez&#xD;
stands for nothing more than a drafting guide: Congress&#xD;
should have described the relevant crime as “transfer or&#xD;
possession of a firearm anywhere in the nation”—thus&#xD;
including commercial and noncommercial activity, and&#xD;
clearly encompassing some activity with assuredly sub-&#xD;
stantial effect on interstate commerce. Had it done so, the&#xD;
majority hints, we would have sustained its authority to&#xD;
regulate possession of firearms in school zones. Further-&#xD;
more, today’s decision suggests we would readily sustain a&#xD;
congressional decision to attach the regulation of intra-&#xD;
state activity to a pre-existing comprehensive (or even not-&#xD;
so-comprehensive) scheme. If so, the Court invites in-&#xD;

&#xD;
creased federal regulation of local activity even if, as it&#xD;
suggests, Congress would not enact a new interstate&#xD;
scheme exclusively for the sake of reaching intrastate&#xD;
activity, see ante, at 22, n. 33; ante, at 6 (SCALIA, J., con-&#xD;
curring in judgment).&#xD;
   I cannot agree that our decision in Lopez contemplated&#xD;
such evasive or overbroad legislative strategies with ap-&#xD;
proval. Until today, such arguments have been made only&#xD;
in dissent. See Morrison, 529 U. S., at 657 (BREYER, J.,&#xD;
dissenting) (given that Congress can regulate “ ‘an essen-&#xD;
tial part of a larger regulation of economic activity,’ ” “can&#xD;
Congress save the present law by including it, or much of&#xD;
it, in a broader ‘Safe Transport’ or ‘Worker Safety’ act?”).&#xD;
Lopez and Morrison did not indicate that the constitution-&#xD;
ality of federal regulation depends on superficial and&#xD;
formalistic distinctions. Likewise I did not understand&#xD;
our discussion of the role of courts in enforcing outer limits&#xD;
of the Commerce Clause for the sake of maintaining the&#xD;
federalist balance our Constitution requires, see Lopez,&#xD;
514 U. S., at 557; id., at 578 (KENNEDY, J., concurring), as&#xD;
a signal to Congress to enact legislation that is more&#xD;
extensive and more intrusive into the domain of state&#xD;
power. If the Court always defers to Congress as it does&#xD;
today, little may be left to the notion of enumerated&#xD;
powers.&#xD;
   The hard work for courts, then, is to identify objective&#xD;
markers for confining the analysis in Commerce Clause&#xD;
cases. Here, respondents challenge the constitutionality of&#xD;
the CSA as applied to them and those similarly situated. I&#xD;
agree with the Court that we must look beyond respon-&#xD;
dents’ own activities. Otherwise, individual litigants could&#xD;
always exempt themselves from Commerce Clause regula-&#xD;
tion merely by pointing to the obvious—that their personal&#xD;
activities do not have a substantial effect on interstate&#xD;
commerce. See Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 193&#xD;
(1968); Wickard, 317 U. S., at 127–128. The task is to&#xD;

&#xD;
identify a mode of analysis that allows Congress to regu-&#xD;
late more than nothing (by declining to reduce each case to&#xD;
its litigants) and less than everything (by declining to let&#xD;
Congress set the terms of analysis). The analysis may not&#xD;
be the same in every case, for it depends on the regulatory&#xD;
scheme at issue and the federalism concerns implicated.&#xD;
See generally Lopez, 514 U. S., at 567; id., at 579&#xD;
(KENNEDY, J., concurring).&#xD;
   A number of objective markers are available to confine&#xD;
the scope of constitutional review here. Both federal and&#xD;
state legislation—including the CSA itself, the California&#xD;
Compassionate Use Act, and other state medical mari-&#xD;
juana legislation—recognize that medical and nonmedical&#xD;
(i.e., recreational) uses of drugs are realistically distinct&#xD;
and can be segregated, and regulate them differently. See&#xD;
21 U. S. C. §812; Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. §11362.5&#xD;
(West Supp. 2005); ante, at 1 (opinion of the Court). Re-&#xD;
spondents challenge only the application of the CSA to&#xD;
medicinal use of marijuana. Cf. United States v. Raines,&#xD;
362 U. S. 17, 20–22 (1960) (describing our preference for&#xD;
as-applied rather than facial challenges). Moreover, be-&#xD;
cause fundamental structural concerns about dual sover-&#xD;
eignty animate our Commerce Clause cases, it is relevant&#xD;
that this case involves the interplay of federal and state&#xD;
regulation in areas of criminal law and social policy, where&#xD;
“States lay claim by right of history and expertise.” Lopez,&#xD;
supra, at 583 (KENNEDY, J., concurring); see also Morri-&#xD;
son, supra, at 617–619; Lopez, supra, at 580 (KENNEDY, J.,&#xD;

balance to a degree that renders it an unconstitutional&#xD;
assertion of the commerce power, and our intervention is&#xD;
required”); cf. Garcia, 469 U. S., at 586 (O’CONNOR, J.,&#xD;

guish the regulation of medicinal marijuana. To ascertain&#xD;
whether Congress’ encroachment is constitutionally justi-&#xD;
fied in this case, then, I would focus here on the personal&#xD;
cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for medicinal&#xD;
purposes.&#xD;
                              B&#xD;
  Having thus defined the relevant conduct, we must&#xD;
determine whether, under our precedents, the conduct is&#xD;
economic and, in the aggregate, substantially affects&#xD;
interstate commerce. Even if intrastate cultivation and&#xD;
possession of marijuana for one’s own medicinal use can&#xD;
properly be characterized as economic, and I question&#xD;
whether it can, it has not been shown that such activity&#xD;
substantially affects interstate commerce. Similarly, it is&#xD;
neither self-evident nor demonstrated that regulating&#xD;
such activity is necessary to the interstate drug control&#xD;
scheme.&#xD;
  The Court’s definition of economic activity is breathtak-&#xD;
ing. It defines as economic any activity involving the&#xD;
production, distribution, and consumption of commodities.&#xD;
And it appears to reason that when an interstate market&#xD;
for a commodity exists, regulating the intrastate manufac-&#xD;
ture or possession of that commodity is constitutional&#xD;
either because that intrastate activity is itself economic, or&#xD;
because regulating it is a rational part of regulating its&#xD;
market. Putting to one side the problem endemic to the&#xD;
Court’s opinion—the shift in focus from the activity at&#xD;
issue in this case to the entirety of what the CSA regu-&#xD;
lates, see Lopez, supra, at 565 (“depending on the level of&#xD;
generality, any activity can be looked upon as commer-&#xD;
cial”)—the Court’s definition of economic activity for pur-&#xD;
poses of Commerce Clause jurisprudence threatens to&#xD;
sweep all of productive human activity into federal regula-&#xD;
tory reach.&#xD;

skirt the real problem of drawing a meaningful line be-&#xD;
tween “what is national and what is local,” Jones &amp;&#xD;
Laughlin Steel, 301 U. S., at 37. It will not do to say that&#xD;
Congress may regulate noncommercial activity simply&#xD;
because it may have an effect on the demand for commer-&#xD;
cial goods, or because the noncommercial endeavor can, in&#xD;
some sense, substitute for commercial activity. Most&#xD;
commercial goods or services have some sort of privately&#xD;
producible analogue. Home care substitutes for daycare.&#xD;
Charades games substitute for movie tickets. Backyard or&#xD;
windowsill gardening substitutes for going to the super-&#xD;
market. To draw the line wherever private activity affects&#xD;
the demand for market goods is to draw no line at all, and&#xD;
to declare everything economic. We have already rejected&#xD;
the result that would follow—a federal police power.&#xD;
Lopez, supra, at 564.&#xD;
   In Lopez and Morrison, we suggested that economic&#xD;
activity usually relates directly to commercial activity.&#xD;
See Morrison, 529 U. S., at 611, n. 4 (intrastate activities&#xD;
that have been within Congress’ power to regulate have&#xD;
been “of an apparent commercial character”); Lopez, 514&#xD;
U. S., at 561 (distinguishing the Gun-Free School Zones&#xD;
Act of 1990 from “activities that arise out of or are con-&#xD;
nected with a commercial transaction”). The homegrown&#xD;
cultivation and personal possession and use of marijuana&#xD;
for medicinal purposes has no apparent commercial char-&#xD;
acter. Everyone agrees that the marijuana at issue in this&#xD;
case was never in the stream of commerce, and neither&#xD;
were the supplies for growing it. (Marijuana is highly&#xD;
unusual among the substances subject to the CSA in that&#xD;
it can be cultivated without any materials that have trav-&#xD;
eled in interstate commerce.) Lopez makes clear that&#xD;
possession is not itself commercial activity. Ibid. And&#xD;
respondents have not come into possession by means of&#xD;
any commercial transaction; they have simply grown, in&#xD;
their own homes, marijuana for their own use, without&#xD;

acquiring, buying, selling, or bartering a thing of value.&#xD;
Cf. id., at 583 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (“The statute now&#xD;
before us forecloses the States from experimenting . . . and&#xD;
it does so by regulating an activity beyond the realm of&#xD;
commerce in the ordinary and usual sense of that term”).&#xD;
   The Court suggests that Wickard, which we have identi-&#xD;
fied as “perhaps the most far reaching example of Com-&#xD;
merce Clause authority over intrastate activity,” Lopez,&#xD;
supra, at 560, established federal regulatory power over&#xD;
any home consumption of a commodity for which a na-&#xD;
tional market exists. I disagree. Wickard involved a&#xD;
challenge to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938&#xD;
(AAA), which directed the Secretary of Agriculture to set&#xD;
national quotas on wheat production, and penalties for&#xD;
excess production. 317 U. S., at 115–116. The AAA itself&#xD;
confirmed that Congress made an explicit choice not to&#xD;
reach—and thus the Court could not possibly have ap-&#xD;
proved of federal control over—small-scale, noncommercial&#xD;
wheat farming. In contrast to the CSA’s limitless asser-&#xD;
tion of power, Congress provided an exemption within the&#xD;
AAA for small producers. When Filburn planted the&#xD;
wheat at issue in Wickard, the statute exempted plantings&#xD;
less than 200 bushels (about six tons), and when he har-&#xD;
vested his wheat it exempted plantings less than six acres.&#xD;
Id., at 130, n. 30. Wickard, then, did not extend Com-&#xD;
merce Clause authority to something as modest as the&#xD;
home cook’s herb garden. This is not to say that Congress&#xD;
may never regulate small quantities of commodities pos-&#xD;
sessed or produced for personal use, or to deny that it&#xD;
sometimes needs to enact a zero tolerance regime for such&#xD;
commodities. It is merely to say that Wickard did not hold&#xD;
or imply that small-scale production of commodities is&#xD;
always economic, and automatically within Congress’&#xD;
reach.&#xD;
   Even assuming that economic activity is at issue in this&#xD;
case, the Government has made no showing in fact that&#xD;

&#xD;
the possession and use of homegrown marijuana for medi-&#xD;
cal purposes, in California or elsewhere, has a substantial&#xD;
effect on interstate commerce. Similarly, the Government&#xD;
has not shown that regulating such activity is necessary to&#xD;
an interstate regulatory scheme. Whatever the specific&#xD;
theory of “substantial effects” at issue (i.e., whether the&#xD;
activity substantially affects interstate commerce,&#xD;
whether its regulation is necessary to an interstate regu-&#xD;
latory scheme, or both), a concern for dual sovereignty&#xD;
requires that Congress’ excursion into the traditional&#xD;
domain of States be justified.&#xD;
   That is why characterizing this as a case about the&#xD;
Necessary and Proper Clause does not change the analysis&#xD;
significantly. Congress must exercise its authority under&#xD;
the Necessary and Proper Clause in a manner consistent&#xD;
with basic constitutional principles. Garcia, 469 U. S., at&#xD;
585 (O’CONNOR, J., dissenting) (“It is not enough that the&#xD;
‘end be legitimate’; the means to that end chosen by Con-&#xD;
gress must not contravene the spirit of the Constitution”).&#xD;
As JUSTICE SCALIA recognizes, see ante, at 7 (opinion&#xD;
concurring in judgment), Congress cannot use its author-&#xD;
ity under the Clause to contravene the principle of state&#xD;
sovereignty embodied in the Tenth Amendment. Ibid.&#xD;
Likewise, that authority must be used in a manner consis-&#xD;
tent with the notion of enumerated powers—a structural&#xD;
principle that is as much part of the Constitution as the&#xD;
Tenth Amendment’s explicit textual command. Accord-&#xD;
ingly, something more than mere assertion is required&#xD;
when Congress purports to have power over local activity&#xD;
whose connection to an intrastate market is not self-&#xD;
evident. Otherwise, the Necessary and Proper Clause will&#xD;
always be a back door for unconstitutional federal regula-&#xD;
tion. Cf. Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 923 (1997)&#xD;
(the Necessary and Proper Clause is “the last, best hope of&#xD;
those who defend ultra vires congressional action”). In-&#xD;

&#xD;
the Court to supply conceivable justifications for intra-&#xD;
state regulation related to an interstate market, then we&#xD;
could have surmised in Lopez that guns in school zones&#xD;
are “never more than an instant from the interstate mar-&#xD;
ket” in guns already subject to extensive federal regula-&#xD;
tion, ante, at 8 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment), recast&#xD;
Lopez as a Necessary and Proper Clause case, and thereby&#xD;
upheld the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990. (According&#xD;
to the Court’s and the concurrence’s logic, for example, the&#xD;
Lopez court should have reasoned that the prohibition on&#xD;
gun possession in school zones could be an appropriate&#xD;
means of effectuating a related prohibition on “sell[ing]” or&#xD;
“deliver[ing]” firearms or ammunition to “any individual&#xD;
who the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe&#xD;
is less than eighteen years of age.” 18 U. S. C. §922(b)(1)&#xD;
(1988 ed., Supp. II).)&#xD;
   There is simply no evidence that homegrown medicinal&#xD;
marijuana users constitute, in the aggregate, a sizable&#xD;
enough class to have a discernable, let alone substantial,&#xD;
impact on the national illicit drug market—or otherwise to&#xD;
threaten the CSA regime. Explicit evidence is helpful&#xD;
when substantial effect is not “visible to the naked eye.”&#xD;
See Lopez, 514 U. S., at 563. And here, in part because&#xD;
common sense suggests that medical marijuana users may&#xD;
be limited in number and that California’s Compassionate&#xD;
Use Act and similar state legislation may well isolate&#xD;
activities relating to medicinal marijuana from the illicit&#xD;
market, the effect of those activities on interstate drug&#xD;
traffic is not self-evidently substantial.&#xD;
   In this regard, again, this case is readily distinguishable&#xD;
from Wickard. To decide whether the Secretary could&#xD;
regulate local wheat farming, the Court looked to “the&#xD;
actual effects of the activity in question upon interstate&#xD;
commerce.” 317 U. S., at 120. Critically, the Court was&#xD;
able to consider “actual effects” because the parties had&#xD;
“stipulated a summary of the economics of the wheat&#xD;
                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           13&#xD;

&#xD;
industry.” Id., at 125. After reviewing in detail the pic-&#xD;
ture of the industry provided in that summary, the Court&#xD;
explained that consumption of homegrown wheat was the&#xD;
most variable factor in the size of the national wheat crop,&#xD;
and that on-site consumption could have the effect of&#xD;
varying the amount of wheat sent to market by as much as&#xD;
20 percent. Id., at 127. With real numbers at hand, the&#xD;
Wickard Court could easily conclude that “a factor of such&#xD;
volume and variability as home-consumed wheat would&#xD;
have a substantial influence on price and market condi-&#xD;
tions” nationwide. Id., at 128; see also id., at 128–129&#xD;
(“This record leaves us in no doubt” about substantial&#xD;
effects).&#xD;
   The Court recognizes that “the record in the Wickard&#xD;
case itself established the causal connection between the&#xD;
production for local use and the national market” and&#xD;
argues that “we have before us findings by Congress to the&#xD;
same effect.” Ante, at 17 (emphasis added). The Court&#xD;
refers to a series of declarations in the introduction to the&#xD;
CSA saying that (1) local distribution and possession of&#xD;
controlled substances causes “swelling” in interstate traf-&#xD;
fic; (2) local production and distribution cannot be distin-&#xD;
guished from interstate production and distribution; (3)&#xD;
federal control over intrastate incidents “is essential to&#xD;
effective control” over interstate drug trafficking. 21&#xD;
U. S. C. §§801(1)–(6). These bare declarations cannot be&#xD;
compared to the record before the Court in Wickard.&#xD;
   They amount to nothing more than a legislative insis-&#xD;
tence that the regulation of controlled substances must be&#xD;
absolute. They are asserted without any supporting evi-&#xD;
dence—descriptive, statistical, or otherwise. “[S]imply&#xD;
because Congress may conclude a particular activity sub-&#xD;
stantially affects interstate commerce does not necessarily&#xD;
make it so.” Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclama-&#xD;
tion Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 311 (1981) (REHNQUIST, J.,&#xD;
concurring in judgment). Indeed, if declarations like these&#xD;

&#xD;
suffice to justify federal regulation, and if the Court today&#xD;
is right about what passes rationality review before us,&#xD;
then our decision in Morrison should have come out the&#xD;
other way. In that case, Congress had supplied numerous&#xD;
findings regarding the impact gender-motivated violence&#xD;
had on the national economy. 529 U. S., at 614; id., at&#xD;
628–636 (SOUTER, J., dissenting) (chronicling findings).&#xD;
But, recognizing that “ ‘ “[w]hether particular operations&#xD;
affect interstate commerce sufficiently to come under the&#xD;
constitutional power of Congress to regulate them is ulti-&#xD;
mately a judicial rather than a legislative question,” ’ ” we&#xD;
found Congress’ detailed findings inadequate. Id., at 614&#xD;
(quoting Lopez, supra, at 557, n. 2, in turn quoting Heart&#xD;
of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 273&#xD;
(1964) (Black, J., concurring)). If, as the Court claims,&#xD;
today’s decision does not break with precedent, how can it&#xD;
be that voluminous findings, documenting extensive hear-&#xD;
ings about the specific topic of violence against women, did&#xD;
not pass constitutional muster in Morrison, while the&#xD;
CSA’s abstract, unsubstantiated, generalized findings&#xD;
about controlled substances do?&#xD;
   In particular, the CSA’s introductory declarations are&#xD;
too vague and unspecific to demonstrate that the federal&#xD;
statutory scheme will be undermined if Congress cannot&#xD;
exert power over individuals like respondents. The decla-&#xD;
rations are not even specific to marijuana. (Facts about&#xD;
substantial effects may be developed in litigation to com-&#xD;
pensate for the inadequacy of Congress’ findings; in part&#xD;
because this case comes to us from the grant of a prelimi-&#xD;
nary injunction, there has been no such development.)&#xD;
Because here California, like other States, has carved out&#xD;
a limited class of activity for distinct regulation, the in-&#xD;
adequacy of the CSA’s findings is especially glaring. The&#xD;
California Compassionate Use Act exempts from other&#xD;
state drug laws patients and their caregivers “who pos-&#xD;
ses[s] or cultivat[e] marijuana for the personal medical&#xD;

&#xD;
purposes of the patient upon the written or oral recom-&#xD;
mendation of a physician” to treat a list of serious medical&#xD;
conditions. Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. §§11362.5(d),&#xD;
11362.7(h) (West Supp. 2005) (emphasis added). Compare&#xD;
ibid. with, e.g., §11357(b) (West 1991) (criminalizing mari-&#xD;
juana possession in excess of 28.5 grams); §11358 (crimi-&#xD;
nalizing marijuana cultivation). The Act specifies that it&#xD;
should not be construed to supersede legislation prohibit-&#xD;
ing persons from engaging in acts dangerous to others, or&#xD;
to condone the diversion of marijuana for nonmedical&#xD;
purposes. §11362.5(b)(2) (West Supp. 2005). To promote&#xD;
the Act’s operation and to facilitate law enforcement,&#xD;
California recently enacted an identification card system&#xD;
for qualified patients. §§11362.7–11362.83. We generally&#xD;
assume States enforce their laws, see Riley v. National&#xD;
Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 795&#xD;
(1988), and have no reason to think otherwise here.&#xD;
   The Government has not overcome empirical doubt that&#xD;
the number of Californians engaged in personal cultiva-&#xD;
tion, possession, and use of medical marijuana, or the&#xD;
amount of marijuana they produce, is enough to threaten&#xD;
the federal regime. Nor has it shown that Compassionate&#xD;
Use Act marijuana users have been or are realistically&#xD;
likely to be responsible for the drug’s seeping into the&#xD;
market in a significant way. The Government does cite&#xD;
one estimate that there were over 100,000 Compassionate&#xD;
Use Act users in California in 2004, Reply Brief for Peti-&#xD;
tioners 16, but does not explain, in terms of proportions,&#xD;

marijuana registrants represented less than 0.05 percent&#xD;

evidence about the CSA’s enforcement. See Reply Brief for&#xD;
Petitioners 17–18. The Court also offers some arguments&#xD;
about the effect of the Compassionate Use Act on the&#xD;
national market. It says that the California statute might&#xD;
be vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous physicians,&#xD;
that Compassionate Use Act patients may overproduce,&#xD;
and that the history of the narcotics trade shows the diffi-&#xD;
culty of cordoning off any drug use from the rest of the&#xD;
market. These arguments are plausible; if borne out in&#xD;
fact they could justify prosecuting Compassionate Use Act&#xD;
patients under the federal CSA. But, without substantia-&#xD;
tion, they add little to the CSA’s conclusory statements&#xD;
about diversion, essentiality, and market effect. Piling&#xD;
assertion upon assertion does not, in my view, satisfy the&#xD;

  Relying on Congress’ abstract assertions, the Court has&#xD;
endorsed making it a federal crime to grow small amounts&#xD;
of marijuana in one’s own home for one’s own medicinal&#xD;
use. This overreaching stifles an express choice by some&#xD;
States, concerned for the lives and liberties of their people,&#xD;
to regulate medical marijuana differently. If I were a&#xD;
California citizen, I would not have voted for the medical&#xD;
marijuana ballot initiative; if I were a California legislator&#xD;
I would not have supported the Compassionate Use Act.&#xD;
But whatever the wisdom of California’s experiment with&#xD;
medical marijuana, the federalism principles that have&#xD;
driven our Commerce Clause cases require that room for&#xD;
experiment be protected in this case. For these reasons I&#xD;

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&#xD;

                        [June 6, 2005]&#xD;
&#xD;
   JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.&#xD;
   Respondents Diane Monson and Angel Raich use mari-&#xD;
juana that has never been bought or sold, that has never&#xD;
crossed state lines, and that has had no demonstrable&#xD;
effect on the national market for marijuana. If Congress&#xD;
can regulate this under the Commerce Clause, then it can&#xD;
regulate virtually anything—and the Federal Government&#xD;
is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers.&#xD;
                               I&#xD;
   Respondents’ local cultivation and consumption of mari-&#xD;
juana is not “Commerce . . . among the several States.”&#xD;
U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 3. By holding that Congress&#xD;
may regulate activity that is neither interstate nor com-&#xD;
merce under the Interstate Commerce Clause, the Court&#xD;
abandons any attempt to enforce the Constitution’s limits&#xD;
on federal power. The majority supports this conclusion&#xD;
by invoking, without explanation, the Necessary and&#xD;
Proper Clause. Regulating respondents’ conduct, however,&#xD;
is not “necessary and proper for carrying into Execution”&#xD;
Congress’ restrictions on the interstate drug trade. Art. I,&#xD;
§8, cl. 18. Thus, neither the Commerce Clause nor the&#xD;
Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power&#xD;
to regulate respondents’ conduct.&#xD;

&#xD;
                    THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
                              A&#xD;
  As I explained at length in United States v. Lopez, 514&#xD;
U. S. 549 (1995), the Commerce Clause empowers Con-&#xD;
gress to regulate the buying and selling of goods and&#xD;
services trafficked across state lines. Id., at 586–589&#xD;
(concurring opinion). The Clause’s text, structure, and&#xD;
history all indicate that, at the time of the founding, the&#xD;
term “ ‘commerce’ consisted of selling, buying, and barter-&#xD;
ing, as well as transporting for these purposes.” Id., at&#xD;
585 (THOMAS, J., concurring). Commerce, or trade, stood&#xD;
in contrast to productive activities like manufacturing and&#xD;
agriculture. Id., at 586–587 (THOMAS, J., concurring).&#xD;
Throughout founding-era dictionaries, Madison’s notes&#xD;
from the Constitutional Convention, The Federalist Pa-&#xD;
pers, and the ratification debates, the term “commerce” is&#xD;
consistently used to mean trade or exchange—not all&#xD;
economic or gainful activity that has some attenuated&#xD;
connection to trade or exchange. Ibid. (THOMAS, J., con-&#xD;
curring); Barnett, The Original Meaning of the Commerce&#xD;
Clause, 68 U. Chi. L. Rev. 101, 112–125 (2001). The term&#xD;
“commerce” commonly meant trade or exchange (and&#xD;
shipping for these purposes) not simply to those involved&#xD;
in the drafting and ratification processes, but also to the&#xD;
general public. Barnett, New Evidence of the Original&#xD;
Meaning of the Commerce Clause, 55 Ark. L. Rev. 847,&#xD;
857–862 (2003).&#xD;
  Even the majority does not argue that respondents’ con-&#xD;
duct is itself “Commerce among the several States.” Art. I,&#xD;
§8, cl. 3. Ante, at 19. Monson and Raich neither buy nor&#xD;
sell the marijuana that they consume. They cultivate&#xD;
their cannabis entirely in the State of California—it never&#xD;
crosses state lines, much less as part of a commercial&#xD;
transaction. Certainly no evidence from the founding&#xD;
suggests that “commerce” included the mere possession of&#xD;
a good or some purely personal activity that did not in-&#xD;
volve trade or exchange for value. In the early days of the&#xD;
                      Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                      3&#xD;
&#xD;
                          THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
Republic, it would have been unthinkable that Congress&#xD;
could prohibit the local cultivation, possession, and con-&#xD;
sumption of marijuana.&#xD;
  On this traditional understanding of “commerce,” the&#xD;
Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U. S. C. §801 et seq.,&#xD;
regulates a great deal of marijuana trafficking that is&#xD;
interstate and commercial in character. The CSA does&#xD;
not, however, criminalize only the interstate buying and&#xD;
selling of marijuana. Instead, it bans the entire market—&#xD;
intrastate or interstate, noncommercial or commercial—&#xD;
for marijuana. Respondents are correct that the CSA&#xD;
exceeds Congress’ commerce power as applied to their&#xD;
conduct, which is purely intrastate and noncommercial.&#xD;
                              B&#xD;
  More difficult, however, is whether the CSA is a valid&#xD;
exercise of Congress’ power to enact laws that are “neces-&#xD;
sary and proper for carrying into Execution” its power to&#xD;
regulate interstate commerce. Art. I, §8, cl. 18. The Neces-&#xD;
sary and Proper Clause is not a warrant to Congress to&#xD;
enact any law that bears some conceivable connection to the&#xD;
exercise of an enumerated power.1 Nor is it, however, a&#xD;
command to Congress to enact only laws that are absolutely&#xD;
indispensable to the exercise of an enumerated power.2&#xD;
  In McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), this&#xD;
Court, speaking through Chief Justice Marshall, set forth&#xD;
a test for determining when an Act of Congress is permis-&#xD;
sible under the Necessary and Proper Clause:&#xD;

To act under the Necessary and Proper Clause, then,&#xD;
Congress must select a means that is “appropriate” and&#xD;
“plainly adapted” to executing an enumerated power; the&#xD;
means cannot be otherwise “prohibited” by the Constitu-&#xD;
tion; and the means cannot be inconsistent with “the letter&#xD;
and spirit of the [C]onstitution.” Ibid.; D. Currie, The&#xD;
Constitution in the Supreme Court: The First Hundred&#xD;
Years 1789–1888, pp. 163–164 (1985). The CSA, as ap-&#xD;
plied to respondents’ conduct, is not a valid exercise of&#xD;
Congress’ power under the Necessary and Proper Clause.&#xD;
                              1&#xD;
   Congress has exercised its power over interstate com-&#xD;
merce to criminalize trafficking in marijuana across state&#xD;
lines. The Government contends that banning Monson&#xD;
and Raich’s intrastate drug activity is “necessary and&#xD;
proper for carrying into Execution” its regulation of inter-&#xD;
state drug trafficking. Art. I, §8, cl. 18. See 21 U. S. C.&#xD;
§801(6). However, in order to be “necessary,” the intra-&#xD;
state ban must be more than “a reasonable means [of]&#xD;
effectuat[ing] the regulation of interstate commerce.”&#xD;
Brief for Petitioners 14; see ante, at 19 (majority opinion)&#xD;
(employing rational-basis review). It must be “plainly&#xD;
adapted” to regulating interstate marijuana trafficking—&#xD;
in other words, there must be an “obvious, simple, and&#xD;
direct relation” between the intrastate ban and the regula-&#xD;
tion of interstate commerce. Sabri v. United States, 541&#xD;
U. S. 600, 613 (2004) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment);&#xD;
see also United States v. Dewitt, 9 Wall. 41, 44 (1870) (find-&#xD;

Congress’ taxing power).&#xD;
    On its face, a ban on the intrastate cultivation, posses-&#xD;
sion and distribution of marijuana may be plainly adapted&#xD;
to stopping the interstate flow of marijuana. Unregulated&#xD;
local growers and users could swell both the supply and&#xD;
the demand sides of the interstate marijuana market,&#xD;
making the market more difficult to regulate. Ante, at 9–&#xD;
10, 19 (majority opinion). But respondents do not chal-&#xD;
lenge the CSA on its face. Instead, they challenge it as&#xD;
applied to their conduct. The question is thus whether the&#xD;
intrastate ban is “necessary and proper” as applied to&#xD;
medical marijuana users like respondents.3&#xD;
    Respondents are not regulable simply because they&#xD;
belong to a large class (local growers and users of mari-&#xD;
juana) that Congress might need to reach, if they also&#xD;
belong to a distinct and separable subclass (local growers&#xD;
and users of state-authorized, medical marijuana) that&#xD;
does not undermine the CSA’s interstate ban. Ante, at 6–7&#xD;
(O’CONNOR, J., dissenting). The Court of Appeals found&#xD;
that respondents’ “limited use is distinct from the broader&#xD;
illicit drug market,” because “th[eir] medicinal marijuana&#xD;
. . . is not intended for, nor does it enter, the stream of&#xD;
commerce.” Raich v. Ashcroft, 352 F. 3d 1222, 1228 (CA9&#xD;
2003). If that is generally true of individuals who grow&#xD;
and use marijuana for medical purposes under state law,&#xD;
then even assuming Congress has “obvious” and “plain”&#xD;
reasons why regulating intrastate cultivation and posses-&#xD;
sion is necessary to regulating the interstate drug trade,&#xD;
none of those reasons applies to medical marijuana pa-&#xD;
tients like Monson and Raich.&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  3 Because respondents do not challenge on its face the CSA’s ban on&#xD;
&#xD;
marijuana, 21 U. S. C. §§841(a)(1), 844(a), our adjudication of their as-&#xD;
applied challenge casts no doubt on this Court’s practice in United&#xD;
States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), and United States v. Morrison, 529&#xD;
U. S. 598 (2000). In those cases, we held that Congress, in enacting the&#xD;
statutes at issue, had exceeded its Article I powers.&#xD;

&#xD;
                        THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
   California’s Compassionate Use Act sets respondents’&#xD;
conduct apart from other intrastate producers and users of&#xD;
marijuana. The Act channels marijuana use to “seriously&#xD;
ill Californians,” Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann.&#xD;
§11362.5(b)(1)(A) (West Supp. 2005), and prohibits “the&#xD;
diversion of marijuana for nonmedical purposes,”&#xD;
§11362.5(b)(2).4 California strictly controls the cultivation&#xD;
and possession of marijuana for medical purposes. To be&#xD;
eligible for its program, California requires that a patient&#xD;
have an illness that cannabis can relieve, such as cancer,&#xD;
AIDS, or arthritis, §11362.5(b)(1)(A), and that he obtain a&#xD;
physician’s recommendation or approval, §11362.5(d).&#xD;
Qualified patients must provide personal and medical&#xD;
information to obtain medical identification cards, and&#xD;
there is a statewide registry of cardholders. §§11362.715–&#xD;
.76. Moreover, the Medical Board of California has issued&#xD;
guidelines for physicians’ cannabis recommendations, and&#xD;
it sanctions physicians who do not comply with the guide-&#xD;
lines. See, e.g., People v. Spark, 121 Cal. App. 4th 259,&#xD;
263, 16 Cal. Rptr. 3d 840, 843 (2004).&#xD;
   This class of intrastate users is therefore distinguish-&#xD;
able from others. We normally presume that States en-&#xD;
force their own laws, Riley v. National Federation of Blind&#xD;
of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 795 (1988), and there is no&#xD;
reason to depart from that presumption here: Nothing&#xD;
suggests that California’s controls are ineffective. The scant&#xD;
evidence that exists suggests that few people—the vast&#xD;
majority of whom are aged 40 or older—register to use&#xD;
medical marijuana. General Accounting Office, Marijuana:&#xD;

incidence of medical marijuana use, many law enforce-&#xD;
ment officials report that the introduction of medical&#xD;
marijuana laws has not affected their law enforcement&#xD;
efforts. Id., at 32.&#xD;
   These controls belie the Government’s assertion that&#xD;
placing medical marijuana outside the CSA’s reach “would&#xD;
prevent effective enforcement of the interstate ban on&#xD;
drug trafficking.” Brief for Petitioners 33. Enforcement of&#xD;
the CSA can continue as it did prior to the Compassionate&#xD;
Use Act. Only now, a qualified patient could avoid arrest&#xD;
or prosecution by presenting his identification card to law&#xD;
enforcement officers. In the event that a qualified patient&#xD;
is arrested for possession or his cannabis is seized, he&#xD;
could seek to prove as an affirmative defense that, in&#xD;
conformity with state law, he possessed or cultivated small&#xD;
quantities of marijuana intrastate solely for personal&#xD;
medical use. People v. Mower, 28 Cal. 4th 457, 469–470,&#xD;
49 P. 3d 1067, 1073–1075 (2002); People v. Trippet, 56 Cal.&#xD;
App. 4th 1532, 1549 (1997). Moreover, under the CSA,&#xD;
certain drugs that present a high risk of abuse and addic-&#xD;
tion but that nevertheless have an accepted medical use—&#xD;
drugs like morphine and amphetamines—are available by&#xD;
prescription.     21 U. S. C. §§812(b)(2)(A)–(B); 21 CFR&#xD;
§1308.12 (2004). No one argues that permitting use of&#xD;
these drugs under medical supervision has undermined&#xD;
the CSA’s restrictions.&#xD;
   But even assuming that States’ controls allow some&#xD;
seepage of medical marijuana into the illicit drug market,&#xD;
there is a multibillion-dollar interstate market for mari-&#xD;
juana. Executive Office of the President, Office of Nat.&#xD;

marijuana obviously essential to controlling the interstate&#xD;
drug market.&#xD;
  To be sure, Congress declared that state policy would&#xD;
disrupt federal law enforcement. It believed the across-&#xD;
the-board ban essential to policing interstate drug traffick-&#xD;
ing. 21 U. S. C. §801(6). But as JUSTICE O’CONNOR points&#xD;
out, Congress presented no evidence in support of its&#xD;
conclusions, which are not so much findings of fact as&#xD;
assertions of power. Ante, at 13–14 (dissenting opinion).&#xD;
Congress cannot define the scope of its own power merely&#xD;
by declaring the necessity of its enactments.&#xD;
  In sum, neither in enacting the CSA nor in defending its&#xD;
application to respondents has the Government offered&#xD;
any obvious reason why banning medical marijuana use is&#xD;
necessary to stem the tide of interstate drug trafficking.&#xD;
Congress’ goal of curtailing the interstate drug trade&#xD;
would not plainly be thwarted if it could not apply the&#xD;
CSA to patients like Monson and Raich. That is, unless&#xD;
Congress’ aim is really to exercise police power of the sort&#xD;
reserved to the States in order to eliminate even the intra-&#xD;
state possession and use of marijuana.&#xD;
                               2&#xD;
   Even assuming the CSA’s ban on locally cultivated and&#xD;
consumed marijuana is “necessary,” that does not mean it&#xD;
is also “proper.” The means selected by Congress to regu-&#xD;
late interstate commerce cannot be “prohibited” by, or&#xD;
inconsistent with the “letter and spirit” of, the Constitution.&#xD;
McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 421.&#xD;
   In Lopez, I argued that allowing Congress to regulate&#xD;
intrastate, noncommercial activity under the Commerce&#xD;
Clause would confer on Congress a general “police power”&#xD;
over the Nation. 514 U. S., at 584, 600 (concurring opin-&#xD;

the Necessary and Proper Clause rather than the Com-&#xD;
merce Clause. When agents from the Drug Enforcement&#xD;

Administration raided Monson’s home, they seized six&#xD;
cannabis plants. If the Federal Government can regulate&#xD;
growing a half-dozen cannabis plants for personal con-&#xD;
sumption (not because it is interstate commerce, but&#xD;
because it is inextricably bound up with interstate com-&#xD;
merce), then Congress’ Article I powers—as expanded by&#xD;
the Necessary and Proper Clause—have no meaningful&#xD;
limits. Whether Congress aims at the possession of drugs,&#xD;
guns, or any number of other items, it may continue to&#xD;
“appropria[te] state police powers under the guise of regu-&#xD;

remove the remaining vestiges of States’ traditional police&#xD;

conduct is incidental to regulating the interstate mari-&#xD;
juana market, ante, at 19–20. JUSTICE O’CONNOR ex-&#xD;
plains why the majority’s reasons cannot be reconciled&#xD;
with our recent Commerce Clause jurisprudence. The&#xD;
majority’s justifications, however, suffer from even more&#xD;
fundamental flaws.&#xD;
                               A&#xD;
  The majority holds that Congress may regulate intra-&#xD;
state cultivation and possession of medical marijuana&#xD;
under the Commerce Clause, because such conduct argua-&#xD;
bly has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The&#xD;
majority’s decision is further proof that the “substantial&#xD;
effects” test is a “rootless and malleable standard” at odds&#xD;
with the constitutional design. Morrison, supra, at 627&#xD;
(THOMAS, J., concurring).&#xD;
  The majority’s treatment of the substantial effects test&#xD;
is rootless, because it is not tethered to either the Com-&#xD;
merce Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause. Under&#xD;
the Commerce Clause, Congress may regulate interstate&#xD;
commerce, not activities that substantially affect inter-&#xD;
state commerce—any more than Congress may regulate&#xD;
activities that do not fall within, but that affect, the sub-&#xD;
jects of its other Article I powers. Lopez, supra, at 589&#xD;
(THOMAS, J., concurring). Whatever additional latitude&#xD;
the Necessary and Proper Clause affords, supra, at 9–10,&#xD;
the question is whether Congress’ legislation is essential&#xD;
to the regulation of interstate commerce itself—not&#xD;
whether the legislation extends only to economic activities&#xD;
that substantially affect interstate commerce. Supra, at 4;&#xD;
ante, at 5 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).&#xD;
  The majority’s treatment of the substantial effects test&#xD;
is malleable, because the majority expands the relevant&#xD;
conduct. By defining the class at a high level of generality&#xD;
(as the intrastate manufacture and possession of mari-&#xD;
juana), the majority overlooks that individuals authorized&#xD;
12                       GONZALES v. RAICH&#xD;
&#xD;
                         THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
by state law to manufacture and possess medical mari-&#xD;
juana exert no demonstrable effect on the interstate drug&#xD;
market. Supra, at 7–8. The majority ignores that&#xD;
whether a particular activity substantially affects inter-&#xD;
state commerce—and thus comes within Congress’ reach&#xD;
on the majority’s approach—can turn on a number of&#xD;
objective factors, like state action or features of the regu-&#xD;
lated activity itself. Ante, at 6–7 (O’CONNOR, J., dissent-&#xD;
ing). For instance, here, if California and other States are&#xD;
effectively regulating medical marijuana users, then these&#xD;
users have little effect on the interstate drug trade.6&#xD;
   The substantial effects test is easily manipulated for&#xD;
another reason. This Court has never held that Congress&#xD;
can regulate noneconomic activity that substantially&#xD;
affects interstate commerce. Morrison, 529 U. S., at 613&#xD;
(“[T]hus far in our Nation’s history our cases have upheld&#xD;
Commerce Clause regulation of intrastate activity only&#xD;
where that activity is economic in nature” (emphasis&#xD;
added)); Lopez, supra, at 560. To evade even that modest&#xD;
——————&#xD;
   6 Remarkably, the majority goes so far as to declare this question&#xD;
&#xD;
irrelevant. It asserts that the CSA is constitutional even if California’s&#xD;
current controls are effective, because state action can neither expand&#xD;
nor contract Congress’ powers. Ante, at 27, n. 38. The majority’s&#xD;
assertion is misleading. Regardless of state action, Congress has the&#xD;
power to regulate intrastate economic activities that substantially&#xD;
affect interstate commerce (on the majority’s view) or activities that are&#xD;
necessary and proper to effectuating its commerce power (on my view).&#xD;
But on either approach, whether an intrastate activity falls within the&#xD;
scope of Congress’ powers turns on factors that the majority is unwill-&#xD;
ing to confront. The majority apparently believes that even if States&#xD;
prevented any medical marijuana from entering the illicit drug market,&#xD;
and thus even if there were no need for the CSA to govern medical&#xD;
marijuana users, we should uphold the CSA under the Commerce&#xD;
Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause. Finally, to invoke the&#xD;
Supremacy Clause, as the majority does, ibid., is to beg the question.&#xD;
The CSA displaces California’s Compassionate Use Act if the CSA is&#xD;
constitutional as applied to respondents’ conduct, but that is the very&#xD;
question at issue.&#xD;

restriction on federal power, the majority defines economic&#xD;
activity in the broadest possible terms as the “ ‘the produc-&#xD;
tion, distribution, and consumption of commodities.’ ”7&#xD;
Ante, at 23 (quoting Webster’s Third New International&#xD;
Dictionary 720 (1966) (hereinafter Webster’s 3d). This&#xD;
carves out a vast swath of activities that are subject to&#xD;
federal regulation. See ante, at 8–9 (O’CONNOR, J., dis-&#xD;
senting). If the majority is to be taken seriously, the&#xD;
Federal Government may now regulate quilting bees,&#xD;
clothes drives, and potluck suppers throughout the 50&#xD;
States. This makes a mockery of Madison’s assurance to&#xD;
the people of New York that the “powers delegated” to the&#xD;
Federal Government are “few and defined,” while those of&#xD;
the States are “numerous and indefinite.” The Federalist&#xD;
No. 45, at 313 (J. Madison).&#xD;
   Moreover, even a Court interested more in the modern&#xD;
than the original understanding of the Constitution ought&#xD;
to resolve cases based on the meaning of words that are&#xD;
actually in the document. Congress is authorized to regu-&#xD;
late “Commerce,” and respondents’ conduct does not qual-&#xD;
ify under any definition of that term.8 The majority’s&#xD;
opinion only illustrates the steady drift away from the text&#xD;
of the Commerce Clause. There is an inexorable expan-&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  7 Other    dictionaries do not define the term “economic” as broadly as&#xD;
the majority does. See, e.g., The American Heritage Dictionary of the&#xD;
English Language 583 (3d ed. 1992) (defining “economic” as “[o]f or&#xD;
relating to the production, development, and management of material&#xD;
wealth, as of a country, household, or business enterprise” (emphasis&#xD;
added)). The majority does not explain why it selects a remarkably&#xD;
expansive 40-year-old definition.&#xD;
    8 See, e.g., id., at 380 (“[t]he buying and selling of goods, especially on&#xD;
&#xD;
a large scale, as between cities or nations”); The Random House Dic-&#xD;
tionary of the English Language 411 (2d ed. 1987) (“an interchange of&#xD;
goods or commodities, esp. on a large scale between different countries&#xD;
. . . or between different parts of the same country”); Webster’s 3d 456&#xD;
(“the exchange or buying and selling of commodities esp. on a large&#xD;
scale and involving transportation from place to place”).&#xD;

sion from “ ‘commerce,’ ” ante, at 1, to “commercial” and&#xD;
“economic” activity, ante, at 20, and finally to all “produc-&#xD;
tion, distribution, and consumption” of goods or services&#xD;
for which there is an “established . . . interstate market,”&#xD;
ante, at 23. Federal power expands, but never contracts,&#xD;
with each new locution. The majority is not interpreting&#xD;
the Commerce Clause, but rewriting it.&#xD;
   The majority’s rewriting of the Commerce Clause seems&#xD;
to be rooted in the belief that, unless the Commerce&#xD;
Clause covers the entire web of human activity, Congress&#xD;
will be left powerless to regulate the national economy&#xD;
effectively. Ante, at 15–16; Lopez, 514 U. S., at 573–574&#xD;
(KENNEDY, J., concurring). The interconnectedness of&#xD;
economic activity is not a modern phenomenon unfamiliar&#xD;
to the Framers. Id., at 590–593 (THOMAS, J., concurring);&#xD;
Letter from J. Madison to S. Roane (Sept. 2, 1819), in 3&#xD;
The Founders’ Constitution 259–260 (P. Kurland &amp; R.&#xD;
Lerner eds. 1987). Moreover, the Framers understood&#xD;
what the majority does not appear to fully appreciate:&#xD;
There is a danger to concentrating too much, as well as too&#xD;
little, power in the Federal Government. This Court has&#xD;
carefully avoided stripping Congress of its ability to regu-&#xD;
late interstate commerce, but it has casually allowed the&#xD;
Federal Government to strip States of their ability to&#xD;
regulate intrastate commerce—not to mention a host of&#xD;
local activities, like mere drug possession, that are not&#xD;
commercial.&#xD;
   One searches the Court’s opinion in vain for any hint of&#xD;
what aspect of American life is reserved to the States. Yet&#xD;
this Court knows that “ ‘[t]he Constitution created a Fed-&#xD;
eral Government of limited powers.’ ” New York v. United&#xD;
States, 505 U. S. 144, 155 (1992) (quoting Gregory v.&#xD;
Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 457 (1991)). That is why today’s&#xD;
decision will add no measure of stability to our Commerce&#xD;
Clause jurisprudence: This Court is willing neither to&#xD;
enforce limits on federal power, nor to declare the Tenth&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
Amendment a dead letter. If stability is possible, it is only&#xD;
by discarding the stand-alone substantial effects test and&#xD;
revisiting our definition of “Commerce among the several&#xD;
States.” Congress may regulate interstate commerce—not&#xD;
things that affect it, even when summed together, unless&#xD;
truly “necessary and proper” to regulating interstate&#xD;
commerce.&#xD;
                              B&#xD;
  The majority also inconsistently contends that regulat-&#xD;
ing respondents’ conduct is both incidental and essential&#xD;
to a comprehensive legislative scheme. Ante, at 19–20,&#xD;
21–22. I have already explained why the CSA’s ban on&#xD;
local activity is not essential. Supra, at 7–8. However,&#xD;
the majority further claims that, because the CSA covers a&#xD;
great deal of interstate commerce, it “is of no moment” if it&#xD;
also “ensnares some purely intrastate activity.” Ante, at&#xD;
19. So long as Congress casts its net broadly over an&#xD;
interstate market, according to the majority, it is free to&#xD;
regulate interstate and intrastate activity alike. This&#xD;
cannot be justified under either the Commerce Clause or&#xD;
the Necessary and Proper Clause. If the activity is purely&#xD;
intrastate, then it may not be regulated under the Com-&#xD;
merce Clause. And if the regulation of the intrastate&#xD;
activity is purely incidental, then it may not be regulated&#xD;
under the Necessary and Proper Clause.&#xD;
  Nevertheless, the majority terms this the “pivotal”&#xD;
distinction between the present case and Lopez and Morri-&#xD;
son. Ante, at 20. In Lopez and Morrison, the parties&#xD;
asserted facial challenges, claiming “that a particular&#xD;
statute or provision fell outside Congress’ commerce power&#xD;
in its entirety.” Ante, at 20. Here, by contrast, respon-&#xD;
dents claim only that the CSA falls outside Congress’&#xD;
commerce power as applied to their individual conduct.&#xD;
According to the majority, while courts may set aside&#xD;
whole statutes or provisions, they may not “excise individ-&#xD;
16                    GONZALES v. RAICH&#xD;
&#xD;
                      THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
ual applications of a concededly valid statutory scheme.”&#xD;
Ante, at 20–21; see also Perez v. United States, 402 U. S.&#xD;
146, 154 (1971); Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 192–193&#xD;
(1968).&#xD;
   It is true that if respondents’ conduct is part of a “class of&#xD;
activities . . . and that class is within the reach of federal&#xD;
power,” Perez, supra, at 154 (emphases deleted), then&#xD;
respondents may not point to the de minimis effect of their&#xD;
own personal conduct on the interstate drug market,&#xD;
Wirtz, supra, at 196, n. 27. Ante, at 6 (O’CONNOR, J.,&#xD;
dissenting). But that begs the question at issue: whether&#xD;
respondents’ “class of activities” is “within the reach of&#xD;
federal power,” which depends in turn on whether the&#xD;
class is defined at a low or a high level of generality.&#xD;
Supra, at 5. If medical marijuana patients like Monson&#xD;
and Raich largely stand outside the interstate drug mar-&#xD;
ket, then courts must excise them from the CSA’s cover-&#xD;
age. Congress expressly provided that if “a provision [of&#xD;
the CSA] is held invalid in one of more of its applications,&#xD;
the provision shall remain in effect in all its valid applica-&#xD;
tions that are severable.” 21 U. S. C. §901 (emphasis&#xD;
added); see also United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. ___, ___&#xD;
(2005) (slip op., at 9, and n. 9) (THOMAS, J., dissenting in&#xD;
part).&#xD;
   Even in the absence of an express severability provision,&#xD;
it is implausible that this Court could set aside entire&#xD;
portions of the United States Code as outside Congress’&#xD;
power in Lopez and Morrison, but it cannot engage in the&#xD;
more restrained practice of invalidating particular appli-&#xD;
cations of the CSA that are beyond Congress’ power. This&#xD;
Court has regularly entertained as-applied challenges&#xD;
under constitutional provisions, see United States v.&#xD;
Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 20–21 (1960), including the Commerce&#xD;
Clause, see Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294, 295&#xD;
(1964); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379&#xD;
U. S. 241, 249 (1964); Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111,&#xD;

&#xD;
                    THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
113–114 (1942). There is no reason why, when Congress&#xD;
exceeds the scope of its commerce power, courts may not&#xD;
invalidate Congress’ overreaching on a case-by-case basis.&#xD;
The CSA undoubtedly regulates a great deal of interstate&#xD;
commerce, but that is no license to regulate conduct that&#xD;
is neither interstate nor commercial, however minor or&#xD;
incidental.&#xD;
   If the majority is correct that Lopez and Morrison are&#xD;
distinct because they were facial challenges to “particular&#xD;
statute[s] or provision[s],” ante, at 20, then congressional&#xD;
power turns on the manner in which Congress packages&#xD;
legislation. Under the majority’s reasoning, Congress could&#xD;
not enact—either as a single-subject statute or as a separate&#xD;
provision in the CSA—a prohibition on the intrastate pos-&#xD;
session or cultivation of marijuana. Nor could it enact an&#xD;
intrastate ban simply to supplement existing drug regula-&#xD;
tions. However, that same prohibition is perfectly constitu-&#xD;
tional when integrated into a piece of legislation that&#xD;
reaches other regulable conduct. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 600–&#xD;
601 (THOMAS, J., concurring).&#xD;
   Finally, the majority’s view—that because some of the&#xD;
CSA’s applications are constitutional, they must all be&#xD;
constitutional—undermines its reliance on the substantial&#xD;
effects test. The intrastate conduct swept within a general&#xD;
regulatory scheme may or may not have a substantial&#xD;
effect on the relevant interstate market. “[O]ne always&#xD;
can draw the circle broadly enough to cover an activity&#xD;
that, when taken in isolation, would not have substantial&#xD;
effects on commerce.” Id., at 600 (THOMAS, J., concurring).&#xD;
The breadth of legislation that Congress enacts says noth-&#xD;
ing about whether the intrastate activity substantially&#xD;
affects interstate commerce, let alone whether it is neces-&#xD;
sary to the scheme. Because medical marijuana users in&#xD;
California and elsewhere are not placing substantial&#xD;
amounts of cannabis into the stream of interstate com-&#xD;
merce, Congress may not regulate them under the sub-&#xD;
18                  GONZALES v. RAICH&#xD;
&#xD;
                    THOMAS, J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
stantial effects test, no matter how broadly it drafts the&#xD;
CSA.&#xD;
                        *     *     *&#xD;
  The majority prevents States like California from devis-&#xD;
ing drug policies that they have concluded provide much-&#xD;
needed respite to the seriously ill. It does so without any&#xD;
serious inquiry into the necessity for federal regulation or&#xD;
the propriety of “displac[ing] state regulation in areas of&#xD;
traditional state concern,” id., at 583 (KENNEDY, J., con-&#xD;
curring). The majority’s rush to embrace federal power “is&#xD;
especially unfortunate given the importance of showing&#xD;
respect for the sovereign States that comprise our Federal&#xD;
Union.” United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Coop-&#xD;
erative, 532 U. S. 483, 502 (2001) (STEVENS, J., concurring&#xD;
in judgment). Our federalist system, properly understood,&#xD;
allows California and a growing number of other States to&#xD;
decide for themselves how to safeguard the health and&#xD;
welfare of their citizens. I would affirm the judgment of&#xD;
the Court of Appeals. I respectfully dissent.&#xD;
