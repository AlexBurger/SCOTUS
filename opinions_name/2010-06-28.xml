CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
          THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

    No. 08–861.      Argued December 7, 2009—Decided June 28, 2010
Respondent, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, was
  created as part of a series of accounting reforms in the Sarbanes-
  Oxley Act of 2002. The Board is composed of five members appointed
  by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It was modeled on pri
  vate self-regulatory organizations in the securities industry—such as
  the New York Stock Exchange—that investigate and discipline their
  own members subject to Commission oversight. Unlike these organi
  zations, the Board is a Government-created entity with expansive
  powers to govern an entire industry. Every accounting firm that au
  dits public companies under the securities laws must register with
  the Board, pay it an annual fee, and comply with its rules and over
  sight. The Board may inspect registered firms, initiate formal inves
  tigations, and issue severe sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings.
  The parties agree that the Board is “part of the Government” for con
  stitutional purposes, Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corpora
  tion, 513 U. S. 374, 397, and that its members are “ ‘Officers of the
  United States’ ” who “exercis[e] significant authority pursuant to the
  laws of the United States,” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 125–126.
  While the SEC has oversight of the Board, it cannot remove Board
  members at will, but only “for good cause shown,” “in accordance
  with” specified procedures. §§7211(e)(6), 7217(d)(3). The parties also
  agree that the Commissioners, in turn, cannot themselves be re
  moved by the President except for “ ‘inefficiency, neglect of duty, or
  malfeasance in office.’ ” Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295
  U. S. 602, 620.
     The Board inspected petitioner accounting firm, released a report
  critical of its auditing procedures, and began a formal investigation.

                           Syllabus 


    The firm and petitioner Free Enterprise Fund, a nonprofit organiza
    tion of which the firm is a member, sued the Board and its members,
    seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that the Board is uncon
    stitutional and an injunction preventing the Board from exercising its
    powers. Petitioners argued that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act contravened
    the separation of powers by conferring executive power on Board
    members without subjecting them to Presidential control. The basis
    for petitioners’ challenge was that Board members were insulated
    from Presidential control by two layers of tenure protection: Board
    members could only be removed by the Commission for good cause,
    and the Commissioners could in turn only be removed by the Presi
    dent for good cause. Petitioners also challenged the Board’s ap
    pointment as violating the Appointments Clause, which requires offi
    cers to be appointed by the President with the Senate’s advice and
    consent, or—in the case of “inferior Officers”—by “the President
    alone, . . . the Courts of Law, or . . . the Heads of Departments,”
    Art. II, §2, cl. 2. The United States intervened to defend the statute.
    The District Court found it had jurisdiction and granted summary
    judgment to respondents. The Court of Appeals affirmed. It first
    agreed that the District Court had jurisdiction. It then ruled that the
    dual restraints on Board members’ removal are permissible, and that
    Board members are inferior officers whose appointment is consistent
    with the Appointments Clause.
Held:
    1. The District Court had jurisdiction over these claims. The
 Commission may review any Board rule or sanction, and an ag
 grieved party may challenge the Commission’s “final order” or “rule”
 in a court of appeals under 15 U. S. C. §78y. The Government reads
 §78y as an exclusive route to review, but the text does not expressly
 or implicitly limit the jurisdiction that other statutes confer on dis
 trict courts. It is presumed that Congress does not intend to limit ju
 risdiction if “a finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful ju
 dicial review”; if the suit is “ ‘wholly “collateral” ’ to a statute’s review
 provisions”; and if the claims are “outside the agency’s expertise.”
 Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U. S. 200, 212–213.
    These considerations point against any limitation on review here.
 Section 78y provides only for review of Commission action, and peti
 tioners’ challenge is “collateral” to any Commission orders or rules
 from which review might be sought. The Government advises peti
 tioners to raise their claims by appealing a Board sanction, but peti
 tioners have not been sanctioned, and it is no “meaningful” avenue of
 relief, Thunder Basin, supra, at 212, to require a plaintiff to incur a
 sanction in order to test a law’s validity, MedImmune, Inc. v. Genen
 tech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 129. Petitioners’ constitutional claims are

also outside the Commission’s competence and expertise, and the
statutory questions involved do not require technical considerations
of agency policy. Pp. 7–10.
   2. The dual for-cause limitations on the removal of Board members
contravene the Constitution’s separation of powers. Pp. 10–27.
      (a) The Constitution provides that “[t]he executive Power shall be
vested in a President of the United States of America.” Art. II, §1,
cl. 1. Since 1789, the Constitution has been understood to empower
the President to keep executive officers accountable—by removing
them from office, if necessary. See generally Myers v. United States,
272 U. S. 52. This Court has determined that this authority is not
without limit. In Humphrey’s Executor, supra, this Court held that
Congress can, under certain circumstances, create independent agen
cies run by principal officers appointed by the President, whom the
President may not remove at will but only for good cause. And in
United States v. Perkins, 116 U. S. 483, and Morrison v. Olson, 487
U. S. 654, the Court sustained similar restrictions on the power of
principal executive officers—themselves responsible to the Presi
dent—to remove their own inferiors. However, this Court has not
addressed the consequences of more than one level of good-cause ten
ure. Pp. 10–14.
      (b) Where this Court has upheld limited restrictions on the
President’s removal power, only one level of protected tenure sepa
rated the President from an officer exercising executive power. The
President—or a subordinate he could remove at will—decided
whether the officer’s conduct merited removal under the good-cause
standard. Here, the Act not only protects Board members from re
moval except for good cause, but withdraws from the President any
decision on whether that good cause exists. That decision is vested in
other tenured officers—the Commissioners—who are not subject to
the President’s direct control. Because the Commission cannot re
move a Board member at will, the President cannot hold the Com
mission fully accountable for the Board’s conduct. He can only review
the Commissioner’s determination of whether the Act’s rigorous good
cause standard is met. And if the President disagrees with that de
termination, he is powerless to intervene—unless the determination
is so unreasonable as to constitute “ ‘inefficiency, neglect of duty, or
malfeasance in office.’ ” Humphrey’s Executor, supra, at 620.
   This arrangement contradicts Article II’s vesting of the executive
power in the President. Without the ability to oversee the Board, or
to attribute the Board’s failings to those whom he can oversee, the
President is no longer the judge of the Board’s conduct. He can nei
ther ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, nor be held respon
sible for a Board member’s breach of faith. If this dispersion of re
4          FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

                 ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

                           Syllabus 


    sponsibility were allowed to stand, Congress could multiply it further
    by adding still more layers of good-cause tenure. Such diffusion of
    power carries with it a diffusion of accountability; without a clear and
    effective chain of command, the public cannot determine where the
    blame for a pernicious measure should fall. The Act’s restrictions are
    therefore incompatible with the Constitution’s separation of powers.
    Pp. 14–17.
         (c) The “ ‘fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, conven
    ient, and useful in facilitating functions of government, standing
    alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution. ” Bowsher
    v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 736. The Act’s multilevel tenure protections
    provide a blueprint for the extensive expansion of legislative power.
    Congress controls the salary, duties, and existence of executive of
    fices, and only Presidential oversight can counter its influence. The
    Framers created a structure in which “[a] dependence on the people”
    would be the “primary controul on the government,” and that de
    pendence is maintained by giving each branch “the necessary consti
    tutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the
    others.” The Federalist No. 51, p. 349. A key “constitutional means”
    vested in the President was “the power of appointing, overseeing, and
    controlling those who execute the laws.” 1 Annals of Congress 463.
    While a government of “opposite and rival interests” may sometimes
    inhibit the smooth functioning of administration, The Federalist No.
    51, at 349, “[t]he Framers recognized that, in the long term, struc
    tural protections against abuse of power were critical to preserving
    liberty.” Bowsher, supra, at 730. Pp. 17–21.
         (d) The Government errs in arguing that, even if some con
    straints on the removal of inferior executive officers might violate the
    Constitution, the restrictions here do not. There is no construction of
    the Commission’s good-cause removal power that is broad enough to
    avoid invalidation. Nor is the Commission’s broad power over Board
    functions the equivalent of a power to remove Board members. Alter
    ing the Board’s budget or powers is not a meaningful way to control
    an inferior officer; the Commission cannot supervise individual Board
    members if it must destroy the Board in order to fix it. Moreover, the
    Commission’s power over the Board is hardly plenary, as the Board
    may take significant enforcement actions largely independently of
    the Commission. Enacting new SEC rules through the required no
    tice and comment procedures would be a poor means of micro
    managing the Board, and without certain findings, the Act forbids
    any general rule requiring SEC preapproval of Board actions. Fi
    nally, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is highly unusual in committing sub
    stantial executive authority to officers protected by two layers of
    good-cause removal. Pp. 21–27.

                              Syllabus

   3. The unconstitutional tenure provisions are severable from the
remainder of the statute. Because “[t]he unconstitutionality of a part
of an Act does not necessarily defeat or affect the validity of its re
maining provisions,” Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Comm’n
of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234, the “normal rule” is “that partial . . . in
validation is the required course,” Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc.,
472 U. S. 491, 504. The Board’s existence does not violate the sepa
ration of powers, but the substantive removal restrictions imposed by
§§7211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) do. Concluding that the removal restric
tions here are invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission
at will. With the tenure restrictions excised, the Act remains “ ‘fully
operative as a law,’ ” New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 186,
and nothing in the Act’s text or historical context makes it “evident”
that Congress would have preferred no Board at all to a Board whose
members are removable at will, Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480
U. S. 678, 684. The consequence is that the Board may continue to
function as before, but its members may be removed at will by the
Commission. Pp. 27–29.
   4. The Board’s appointment is consistent with the Appointments
Clause. Pp. 29–33.
      (a) The Board members are inferior officers whose appointment
Congress may permissibly vest in a “Hea[d] of Departmen[t].” Infe
rior officers “are officers whose work is directed and supervised at
some level” by superiors appointed by the President with the Senate’s
consent. Edmond v. United States, 520 U. S. 651, 662–663. Because
the good-cause restrictions discussed above are unconstitutional and
void, the Commission possesses the power to remove Board members
at will, in addition to its other oversight authority. Board members
are therefore directed and supervised by the Commission. Pp. 29–30.
      (b) The Commission is a “Departmen[t]” under the Appointments
Clause. Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 887, n. 4, specifi
cally reserved the question whether a “principal agenc[y], such as”
the SEC, is a “Departmen[t].” The Court now adopts the reasoning of
the concurring Justices in Freytag, who would have concluded that
the SEC is such a “Departmen[t]” because it is a freestanding compo
nent of the Executive Branch not subordinate to or contained within
any other such component. This reading is consistent with the com
mon, near-contemporary definition of a “department”; with the early
practice of Congress, see §3, 1 Stat. 234; and with this Court’s cases,
which have never invalidated an appointment made by the head of
such an establishment. Pp. 30–31.
      (c) The several Commissioners, and not the Chairman, are the
Commission’s “Hea[d].” The Commission’s powers are generally
vested in the Commissioners jointly, not the Chairman alone. The

                           Syllabus 


    Commissioners do not report to the Chairman, who exercises admin
    istrative functions subject to the full Commission’s policies. There is
    no reason why a multimember body may not be the “Hea[d]” of a
    “Departmen[t]” that it governs. The Appointments Clause necessar
    ily contemplates collective appointments by the “Courts of Law,”
    Art. II, §2, cl. 2, and each House of Congress appoints its officers col
    lectively, see, e.g., Art. I, §2, cl. 5. Practice has also sanctioned the
    appointment of inferior officers by multimember agencies. Pp. 31–33.
537 F. 3d 667, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

                                 [June 28, 2010] 


  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
  Our Constitution divided the “powers of the new Federal
Government into three defined categories, Legislative,
Executive, and Judicial.” INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919,
951 (1983). Article II vests “[t]he executive Power . . . in a
President of the United States of America,” who must
“take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Art. II,
§1, cl. 1; id., §3. In light of “[t]he impossibility that one
man should be able to perform all the great business of the
State,” the Constitution provides for executive officers to
“assist the supreme Magistrate in discharging the duties
of his trust.” 30 Writings of George Washington 334 (J.
Fitzpatrick ed. 1939).
  Since 1789, the Constitution has been understood to
empower the President to keep these officers account­
able—by removing them from office, if necessary. See
generally Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52 (1926).
This Court has determined, however, that this authority is
not without limit. In Humphrey’s Executor v. United
2       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

                   Opinion of the Court 


States, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), we held that Congress can,
under certain circumstances, create independent agencies
run by principal officers appointed by the President, whom
the President may not remove at will but only for good
cause. Likewise, in United States v. Perkins, 116 U. S. 483
(1886), and Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988), the
Court sustained similar restrictions on the power of prin­
cipal executive officers—themselves responsible to the
President—to remove their own inferiors. The parties do
not ask us to reexamine any of these precedents, and we
do not do so.
  We are asked, however, to consider a new situation not
yet encountered by the Court. The question is whether
these separate layers of protection may be combined. May
the President be restricted in his ability to remove a prin­
cipal officer, who is in turn restricted in his ability to
remove an inferior officer, even though that inferior officer
determines the policy and enforces the laws of the United
States?
  We hold that such multilevel protection from removal is
contrary to Article II’s vesting of the executive power in
the President. The President cannot “take Care that the
Laws be faithfully executed” if he cannot oversee the
faithfulness of the officers who execute them. Here the
President cannot remove an officer who enjoys more than
one level of good-cause protection, even if the President
determines that the officer is neglecting his duties or
discharging them improperly. That judgment is instead
committed to another officer, who may or may not agree
with the President’s determination, and whom the Presi­
dent cannot remove simply because that officer disagrees
with him. This contravenes the President’s “constitutional
obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws.”

                              A

   After a series of celebrated accounting debacles, Con­
gress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (or Act), 116
Stat. 745. Among other measures, the Act introduced
tighter regulation of the accounting industry under a new
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Board
is composed of five members, appointed to staggered 5­
year terms by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
It was modeled on private self-regulatory organizations in
the securities industry—such as the New York Stock
Exchange—that investigate and discipline their own
members subject to Commission oversight. Congress
created the Board as a private “nonprofit corporation,” and
Board members and employees are not considered Gov­
ernment “officer[s] or employee[s]” for statutory purposes.
15 U. S. C. §§7211(a), (b). The Board can thus recruit its
members and employees from the private sector by paying
salaries far above the standard Government pay scale.
See §§7211(f)(4), 7219.1
   Unlike the self-regulatory organizations, however, the
Board is a Government-created, Government-appointed
entity, with expansive powers to govern an entire indus­
try. Every accounting firm—both foreign and domestic—
that participates in auditing public companies under the
securities laws must register with the Board, pay it an
annual fee, and comply with its rules and oversight.
§§7211(a), 7212(a), (f), 7213, 7216(a)(1). The Board is
charged with enforcing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the secu­
rities laws, the Commission’s rules, its own rules, and
professional accounting standards. §§7215(b)(1), (c)(4). To
this end, the Board may regulate every detail of an ac­
counting firm’s practice, including hiring and professional
——————

development, promotion, supervision of audit work, the
acceptance of new business and the continuation of old,
internal inspection procedures, professional ethics rules,
and “such other requirements as the Board may pre­
scribe.” §7213(a)(2)(B).
   The Board promulgates auditing and ethics standards,
performs routine inspections of all accounting firms, de­
mands documents and testimony, and initiates formal
investigations and disciplinary proceedings. §§7213–7215
(2006 ed. and Supp. II). The willful violation of any Board
rule is treated as a willful violation of the Securities Ex­
change Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 881, 15 U. S. C. §78a et seq.—
a federal crime punishable by up to 20 years’ imprison­
ment or $25 million in fines ($5 million for a natural per­
son). §§78ff(a), 7202(b)(1) (2006 ed.). And the Board itself
can issue severe sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings,
up to and including the permanent revocation of a firm’s
registration, a permanent ban on a person’s associating
with any registered firm, and money penalties of $15
million ($750,000 for a natural person). §7215(c)(4).
Despite the provisions specifying that Board members are
not Government officials for statutory purposes, the par­
ties agree that the Board is “part of the Government” for
constitutional purposes, Lebron v. National Railroad
Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 397 (1995), and that
its members are “ ‘Officers of the United States’ ” who
“exercis[e] significant authority pursuant to the laws of
the United States,” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 125–126
(1976) (per curiam) (quoting Art. II, §2, cl. 2); cf. Brief for
Petitioners 9, n. 1; Brief for United States 29, n. 8.
   The Act places the Board under the SEC’s oversight,
particularly with respect to the issuance of rules or the
imposition of sanctions (both of which are subject to Com­
mission approval and alteration). §§7217(b)–(c). But the
individual members of the Board—like the officers and
directors of the self-regulatory organizations—are sub­
                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            5

                      Opinion of the Court

stantially insulated from the Commission’s control. The
Commission cannot remove Board members at will, but
only “for good cause shown,” “in accordance with” certain
procedures. §7211(e)(6).
  Those procedures require a Commission finding, “on the
record” and “after notice and opportunity for a hearing,”
that the Board member
    “(A) has willfully violated any provision of th[e] Act,
    the rules of the Board, or the securities laws;
    “(B) has willfully abused the authority of that mem­
    ber; or
    “(C) without reasonable justification or excuse, has
    failed to enforce compliance with any such provision
    or rule, or any professional standard by any registered
    public accounting firm or any associated person
    thereof.” §7217(d)(3).
Removal of a Board member requires a formal Commis­
sion order and is subject to judicial review. See 5 U. S. C.
§§554(a), 556(a), 557(a), (c)(B); 15 U. S. C. §78y(a)(1).
Similar procedures govern the Commission’s removal of
officers and directors of the private self-regulatory organi­

  Petitioners argue that the Chicago and Oak Park laws
violate the right to keep and bear arms for two reasons.
Petitioners’ primary submission is that this right is among
the “privileges or immunities of citizens of the United
States” and that the narrow interpretation of the Privi
leges or Immunities Clause adopted in the Slaughter-
House Cases, supra, should now be rejected. As a secon
dary argument, petitioners contend that the Fourteenth
Amendment’s Due Process Clause “incorporates” the
Second Amendment right.
  Chicago and Oak Park (municipal respondents) main
tain that a right set out in the Bill of Rights applies to the
States only if that right is an indispensable attribute of
any “ ‘civilized’ ” legal system. Brief for Municipal Respon
dents 9. If it is possible to imagine a civilized country that
does not recognize the right, the municipal respondents
tell us, then that right is not protected by due process.
Ibid. And since there are civilized countries that ban or
strictly regulate the private possession of handguns, the
municipal respondents maintain that due process does not
preclude such measures. Id., at 21–23. In light of the
parties’ far-reaching arguments, we begin by recounting
this Court’s analysis over the years of the relationship
between the provisions of the Bill of Rights and the States.
                             B
   The Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment,
originally applied only to the Federal Government. In

explained that this question was “of great importance” but
“not of much difficulty.” Id., at 247. In less than four

first eight Amendments operate as limitations on the

      </span>, 551–552 (1833) (“[I]t is now settled that those amend
ments [in the Bill of Rights] do not extend to the states”).
   The constitutional Amendments adopted in the after
math of the Civil War fundamentally altered our country’s
federal system. The provision at issue in this case, §1 of
the Fourteenth Amendment, provides, among other
things, that a State may not abridge “the privileges or
immunities of citizens of the United States” or deprive
“any person of life, liberty, or property, without due proc
ess of law.”
   Four years after the adoption of the Fourteenth
Amendment, this Court was asked to interpret the
Amendment’s reference to “the privileges or immunities of
citizens of the United States.” The Slaughter-House
Cases, supra, involved challenges to a Louisiana law per
mitting the creation of a state-sanctioned monopoly on the
butchering of animals within the city of New Orleans.
Justice Samuel Miller’s opinion for the Court concluded
that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only
those rights “which owe their existence to the Federal
government, its National character, its Constitution, or its
laws.” Id., at 79. The Court held that other fundamental
rights—rights that predated the creation of the Federal
Government and that “the State governments were cre
ated to establish and secure”—were not protected by the
Clause. Id., at 76.
   In drawing a sharp distinction between the rights of
federal and state citizenship, the Court relied on two
principal arguments. First, the Court emphasized that
the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities
Clause spoke of “the privileges or immunities of citizens of
the United States,” and the Court contrasted this phrasing
with the wording in the first sentence of the Fourteenth
Amendment and in the Privileges and Immunities Clause

                           Opinion of the Court

of Article IV, both of which refer to state citizenship.5
(Emphasis added.) Second, the Court stated that a con
trary reading would “radically chang[e] the whole theory
of the relations of the State and Federal governments to
each other and of both these governments to the people,”
and the Court refused to conclude that such a change had
been made “in the absence of language which expresses
such a purpose too clearly to admit of doubt.” Id., at 78.
Finding the phrase “privileges or immunities of citizens of
the United States” lacking by this high standard, the
Court reasoned that the phrase must mean something
more limited.
  Under the Court’s narrow reading, the Privileges or
Immunities Clause protects such things as the right
     “to come to the seat of government to assert any claim
     [a citizen] may have upon that government, to trans
     act any business he may have with it, to seek its pro
     tection, to share its offices, to engage in administering
     its functions . . . [and to] become a citizen of any State
     of the Union by a bonâ fide residence therein, with the
     same rights as other citizens of that State.” Id., at
     79–80 (internal quotation marks omitted).
   Finding no constitutional protection against state intru
sion of the kind envisioned by the Louisiana statute, the
Court upheld the statute. Four Justices dissented. Jus
tice Field, joined by Chief Justice Chase and Justices
Swayne and Bradley, criticized the majority for reducing
the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities
——————
   5 The first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment makes “[a]ll per

sons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the juris
diction thereof . . . citizens of the United States and of the State wherein
they reside.” (Emphasis added.) The Privileges and Immunities Clause
of Article IV provides that “[t]he Citizens of each State shall be entitled
to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.”

Clause to “a vain and idle enactment, which accomplished
nothing, and most unnecessarily excited Congress and the
people on its passage.” Id., at 96; see also id., at 104.
Justice Field opined that the Privileges or Immunities
Clause protects rights that are “in their nature . . . funda
mental,” including the right of every man to pursue his
profession without the imposition of unequal or discrimi
natory restrictions. Id., at 96–97. Justice Bradley’s dis
sent observed that “we are not bound to resort to implica
tion . . . to find an authoritative declaration of some of the
most important privileges and immunities of citizens of
the United States. It is in the Constitution itself.” Id., at
118. Justice Bradley would have construed the Privileges
or Immunities Clause to include those rights enumerated
in the Constitution as well as some unenumerated rights.
Id., at 119. Justice Swayne described the majority’s nar
row reading of the Privileges or Immunities Clause as
“turn[ing] . . . what was meant for bread into a stone.” Id.,
at 129 (dissenting opinion).
   Today, many legal scholars dispute the correctness of
the narrow Slaughter-House interpretation. See, e.g.,
Saenz v. Roe, 526 U. S. 489, 522,ou. 1, 527 (1999) (THOMAS,
J., dissenting) (scholars of the Fourteenth Amendment
agree “that the Clause does not mean what the Court said
it meant in 1873”); Amar, Substance and Method in the
Year 2000, 28 Pepperdine L. Rev. 601, 631, n. 178 (2001)
(“Virtually no serious modern scholar—left, right, and
center—thinks that this [interpretation] is a plausible
reading of the Amendment”); Brief for Constitutional Law
Professors as Amici Curiae 33 (claiming an “overwhelming
consensus among leading constitutional scholars” that the
opinion is “egregiously wrong”); C. Black, A New Birth of
Freedom 74–75 (1997).
   Three years after the decision in the Slaughter-House
Cases, the Court decided Cruikshank, the first of the three
19th-century cases on which the Seventh Circuit relied.

92 U. S. 542. In that case, the Court reviewed convictions
stemming from the infamous Colfax Massacre in Louisi
ana on Easter Sunday 1873. Dozens of blacks, many
unarmed, were slaughtered by a rival band of armed white
men.6 Cruikshank himself allegedly marched unarmed
African-American prisoners through the streets and then
had them summarily executed.7 Ninety-seven men were
indicted for participating in the massacre, but only nine
went to trial. Six of the nine were acquitted of all charges;
the remaining three were acquitted of murder but con
victed under the Enforcement Act of 1870, 16 Stat. 140, for
banding and conspiring together to deprive their victims of
various constitutional rights, including the right to bear
arms.8
    The Court reversed all of the convictions, including
those relating to the deprivation of the victims’ right to
bear arms. Cruikshank, 92 U. S., at 553, 559. The Court
wrote that the right of bearing arms for a lawful purpose
“is not a right granted by the Constitution” and is not “in
any manner dependent upon that instrument for its exis
tence.” Id., at 553. “The second amendment,” the Court
continued, “declares that it shall not be infringed; but this
. . . means no more than that it shall not be infringed by
Congress.” Ibid. “Our later decisions in Presser v. Illinois,
116 U. S. 252, 265 (1886), and Miller v. Texas, 153 U. S.
535, 538 (1894), reaffirmed that the Second Amendment
applies only to the Federal Government.” Heller, 554
U. S., at ___, n. 23 (slip op., at 48, n. 23).

                              C
   As previously noted, the Seventh Circuit concluded that
Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller doomed petitioners’
claims at the Court of Appeals level. Petitioners argue,
however, that we should overrule those decisions and hold
that the right to keep and bear arms is one of the “privi
leges or immunities of citizens of the United States.” In
petitioners’ view, the Privileges or Immunities Clause
protects all of the rights set out in the Bill of Rights, as
well as some others, see Brief for Petitioners 10, 14, 15–21,
but petitioners are unable to identify the Clause’s full
scope, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5–6, 8–11. Nor is there any consen
sus on that question among the scholars who agree that
the Slaughter-House Cases’ interpretation is flawed. See
Saenz, supra, at 522, n. 1 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).
   We see no need to reconsider that interpretation here.
For many decades, the questiongof the rights protected by
the Fourteenth Amendment against state infringement
has been analyzed under the Due Process Clause of that
Amendment and not under the Privileges or Immunities
Clause. We therefore decline to disturb the Slaughter-
House holding.
   At the same time, however, this Court’s decisions in
Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller do not preclude us from
considering whether the Due Process Clause of the Four
teenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right
binding on the States. See Heller, 554 U. S., at ___, n. 23
(slip op., at 48, n. 23). None of those cases “engage[d] in
the sort of Fourteenth Amendment inquiry required by
our later cases.” Ibid. As explained more fully below,
Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller all preceded the era in
which the Court began the process of “selective incorpo
ration” under the Due Process Clause, and we have never
previously addressed the question whether the right to
keep and bear arms applies to the States under that
theory.

                     Opinion of the Court

   Indeed, Cruikshank has not prevented us from holding
that other rights that were at issue in that case are bind
ing on the States through the Due Process Clause. In
Cruikshank, the Court held that the general “right of the
people peaceably to assemble for lawful purposes,” which
is protected by the First Amendment, applied only against
the Federal Government and not against the States. See
92 U. S., at 551–552. Nonetheless, over 60 years later the
Court held that the right of peaceful assembly was a “fun
damental righ[t] . . . safeguarded by the due process clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment.” De Jonge v. Oregon, 299
U. S. 353, 364 (1937). We follow the same path here and
thus consider whether the right to keep and bear arms
applies to the States under the Due Process Clause.
                              D
                               1
  In the late 19th century, the Court began to consider
whether the Due Process Clause prohibits the States from
infringing rights set out in the Bill of Rights. See Hurtado
v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884) (due process does not
require grand jury indictment); Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co. v.
Chicago, 166 U. S. 226 (1897) (due process prohibits
States from taking of private property for public use with
out just compensation). Five features of the approach
taken during the ensuing era should be noted.
  First, the Court viewed the due process question as
entirely separate from the question whether a right was a
privilege or immunity of national citizenship. See Twin
ing v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 99 (1908).
  Second, the Court explained that the only rights pro
tected against state infringement by the Due Process
Clause were those rights “of such a nature that they are
included in the conception of due process of law.” Ibid.
See also, e.g., Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46 (1947);
Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455 (1942); Palko v. Connecticut,
12                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                     Opinion of the Court

302 U. S. 319 (1937); Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297
U. S. 233 (1936); Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45 (1932).
While it was “possible that some of the personal rights
safeguarded by the first eight Amendments against Na
tional action [might] also be safeguarded against state
action,” the Court stated, this was “not because those
rights are enumerated in the first eight Amendments.”
Twining, supra, at 99.
   The Court used different formulations in describing the
boundaries of due process. For example, in Twining, the
Court referred to “immutable principles of justice which
inhere in the very idea of free government which no mem
ber of the Union may disregard.” 211 U. S., at 102 (inter
nal quotation marks omitted). In Snyder v. Massachu
setts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934), the Court spoke of rights
that are “so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our
people as to be ranked as fundamental.” And in Palko, the
Court famously said that due process protects those rights
that are “the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty”
and essential to “a fair and enlightened system of justice.”
302 U. S., at 325.
   Third, in some cases decided during this era the Court
“can be seen as having asked, when inquiring into
whether some particular procedural safeguard was re
quired of a State, if a civilized system could be imagined
that would not accord the particular protection.” Duncan
v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149, n. 14 (1968). Thus, in
holding that due process prohibits a State from taking
private property without just compensation, the Court
described the right as “a principle of natural equity, rec
ognized by all temperate and civilized governments, from
a deep and universal sense of its justice.” Chicago, B. &amp;
Q. R. Co., supra, at 238. Similarly, the Court found that
due process did not provide a right against compelled
incrimination in part because this right “has no place in
the jurisprudence of civilized and free countries outside
                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13

                     Opinion of the Court

the domain of the common law.” Twining, supra, at 113.
    Fourth, the Court during this era was not hesitant to
hold that a right set out in the Bill of Rights failed to
meet the test for inclusion within the protection of the
Due Process Clause. The Court found that some such
rights qualified. See, e.g., Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S.
652, 666 (1925) (freedom of speech and press); Near v.
Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697 (1931) (same);
Powell, supra (assistance of counsel in capital cases); De
Jonge, supra (freedom of assembly); Cantwell v. Con
necticut, 310 U. S. 296 (1940) (free exercise of religion).
But others did not. See, e.g., Hurtado, supra (grand jury
indictment requirement); Twining, supra (privilege
against self-incrimination).
    Finally, even when a right set out in the Bill of Rights
was held to fall within the conception of due process, the
protection or remedies afforded against state infringement
sometimes differed from the protection or remedies pro
vided against abridgment by the Federal Government. To
give one example, in Betts the Court held that, although
the Sixth Amendment required the appointment of coun
sel in all federal criminal cases in which the defendant
was unable to retain an attorney, the Due Process Clause
required appointment of counsel in state criminal proceed
ings only where “want of counsel in [the] particular case
. . . result[ed] in a conviction lacking in . . . fundamental
fairness.” 316 U. S., at 473. Similarly, in Wolf v. Colo
rado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949), the Court held that the “core of
the Fourth Amendment” was implicit in the concept of
ordered liberty and thus “enforceable against the States
through the Due Process Clause” but that the exclusionary
rule, which applied in federal cases, did not apply to the
States. Id., at 27–28, 33.
                          2
  An alternative theory regarding the relationship be

                         Opinion of the Court

tween the Bill of Rights and §1 of the Fourteenth Amend
ment was championed by Justice Black. This theory held
that §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated
all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights. See, e.g.,
Adamson, supra, at 71–72 (Black, J., dissenting); Duncan,
supra, at 166 (Black, J., concurring). As Justice Black
noted, the chief congressional proponents of the Four
teenth Amendment espoused the view that the Amend
ment made the Bill of Rights applicable to the States and,
in so doing, overruled this Court’s decision in Barron.9

  9 Senator Jacob Howard, who spoke on behalf of the Joint Committee

on Reconstruction and sponsored the Amendment in the Senate, stated
that the Amendment protected all of “the personal rights guarantied
and secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution.” Cong.
Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 2765 (1866) (hereinafter 39th Cong.
Globe). Representative John Bingham, the principal author of the text
of §1, said that the Amendment would “arm the Congress . . . with the
power to enforce the bill of rights as it stands in the Constitution
today.” Id., at 1088; see also id., at 1089–1090; A. Amar, The Bill of
Rights: Creation and Reconstruction 183 (1998) (hereinafter Amar, Bill
of Rights). After ratification of the Amendment, Bingham maintained
the view that the rights guaranteed by §1 of the Fourteenth Amend
ment “are chiefly defined in the first eight amendments to the Consti
tution of the United States.” Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 84
(1871). Finally, Representative Thaddeus Stevens, the political leader
of the House and acting chairman of the Joint Committee on Recon
struction, stated during the debates on the Amendment that “the
Constitution limits only the action of Congress, and is not a limitation
on the States. This amendment supplies that defect, and allows Con
gress to correct the unjust legislation of the States.” 39th Cong. Globe
2459; see also M. Curtis, No State Shall Abridge: The Fourteenth
Amendment and the Bill of Rights 112 (1986) (counting at least 30
statements during the debates in Congress interpreting §1 to incorpo
rate the Bill of Rights); Brief for Constitutional Law Professors as

senator or representative disputed [the incorporationist] understand

  10 The municipal respondents and some of their amici dispute the

significance of these statements. They contend that the phrase “privi

“total incorporation” theory.
                             3
   While Justice Black’s theory was never adopted, the
Court eventually moved in that direction by initiating
what has been called a process of “selective incorporation,”
i.e., the Court began to hold that the Due Process Clause
fully incorporates particular rights contained in the first
eight Amendments. See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainwright, 372
U. S. 335, 341 (1963); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 5–6

leges or immunities” is not naturally read to mean the rights set out in
the first eight Amendments, see Brief for Historians et al. as Amici
Curiae 13–16, and that “there is ‘support in the legislative history for
no fewer than four interpretations of the . . . Privileges or Immunities
Clause.’ ” Brief for Municipal Respondents 69 (quoting Currie, The
Reconstruction Congress, 75 U. Chi. L. Rev. 383, 406 (2008); brackets
omitted). They question whether there is sound evidence of “ ‘any
strong public awareness of nationalizing the entire Bill of Rights.’ ”

the Bill of Rights: Revisiting the Original Understanding of the Four
teenth Amendment in 1866–67, 68 Ohio St. L. J. 1509, 1600 (2007)).
Scholars have also disputed the total incorporation theory. See, e.g.,
Fairman, Does the Fourteenth Amendment Incorporate the Bill of
Rights? 2 Stan. L. Rev. 5 (1949); Berger, Incorporation of the Bill of
Rights in the Fourteenth Amendment: A Nine-Lived Cat, 42 Ohio St.
L. J. 435 (1981).
  Proponents of the view that §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment makes
all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the States re
spond that the terms privileges, immunities, and rights were used
interchangeably at the time, see, e.g., Curtis, supra, at 64–65, and that
the position taken by the leading congressional proponents of the
Amendment was widely pub,
and the chain of dependence be preserved; the lowest
officers, the middle grade, and the highest, will depend, as
they ought, on the President, and the President on the
community.” 1 Annals of Cong., at 499 (J. Madison).
   By granting the Board executive power without the
Executive’s oversight, this Act subverts the President’s
ability to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed—as
well as the public’s ability to pass judgment on his efforts.
The Act’s restrictions are incompatible with the Constitu­
tion’s separation of powers.
                              C

the dissent, Congress may impose multiple levels of for­
cause tenure between the President and his subordinates
when it “rests agency independence upon the need for
technical expertise.” Post, at 18. The Board’s mission is
said to demand both “technical competence” and “apolitical
expertise,” and its powers may only be exercised by “tech­
nical professional experts.” Post, at 18 (internal quotation

                   Opinion of the Court 


Board is, we are told, simply one example of the “vast
numbers of statutes governing vast numbers of subjects,
concerned with vast numbers of different problems, [that]
provide for, or foresee, their execution or administration
through the work of administrators organized within
many different kinds of administrative structures, exercis­
ing different kinds of administrative authority, to achieve
their legislatively mandated objectives.” Post, at 8.
    No one doubts Congress’s power to create a vast and
varied federal bureaucracy. But where, in all this, is the
role for oversight by an elected President? The Constitu­
tion requires that a President chosen by the entire Nation
oversee the execution of the laws. And the “ ‘fact that a
given law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful
in facilitating functions of government, standing alone,
will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution,’ ” for
“ ‘[c]onvenience and efficiency are not the primary objec­
tives—or the hallmarks—of democratic government.’ ”
Bowsher, 478 U. S., at 736 (quoting Chadha, 462 U. S., at
944).
    One can have a government that functions without
being ruled by functionaries, and a government that bene­
fits from expertise without being ruled by experts. Our
Constitution was adopted to enable the people to govern
themselves, through their elected leaders. The growth of
the Executive Branch, which now wields vast power and
touches almost every aspect of daily life, heightens the
concern that it may slip from the Executive’s control, and
thus from that of the people. This concern is largely ab­
sent from the dissent’s paean to the administrative state.
    For example, the dissent dismisses the importance of
removal as a tool of supervision, concluding that the Presi­
dent’s “power to get something done” more often depends
on “who controls the agency’s budget requests and fund­
ing, the relationships between one agency or department
and another, . . . purely political factors (including Con­

gress’ ability to assert influence),” and indeed whether
particular unelected officials support or “resist” the Presi­
dent’s policies. Post, at 11, 13 (emphasis deleted). The
Framers did not rest our liberties on such bureaucratic
minutiae. As we said in Bowsher, supra, at 730, “[t]he
separated powers of our Government cannot be permitted
to turn on judicial assessment of whether an officer exer­
cising executive power is on good terms with Congress.”
   In fact, the multilevel protection that the dissent en­
dorses “provides a blueprint for extensive expansion of the
legislative power.” MWAA, supra, at 277. In a system of
checks and balances, “[p]ower abhors a vacuum,” and one
branch’s handicap is another’s strength. 537 F. 3d, at 695,
n. 4 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks
omitted). “Even when a branch does not arrogate power to
itself,” therefore, it must not “impair another in the per­
formance of its constitutional duties.” Loving v. United
States, 517 U. S. 748, 757 (1996).5 Congress has plenary
control over the salary, duties, and even existence of ex­
ecutive offices. Only Presidential oversight can counter its
influence. That is why the Constitution vests certain
powers in the President that “the Legislature has no right
to diminish or modify.” 1 Annals of Cong., at 463 (J.
Madison).6
——————
   5 The dissent quotes Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 138 (1976) (per

curiam), for the proposition that Congress has “broad authority to
‘create’ governmental ‘ “offices” ’ and to structure those offices ‘as it
chooses.’ ” Post, at 2. The Buckley Court put “ ‘offices’ ” in quotes
because it was actually describing legislative positions that are not
really offices at all (at least not under Article II). That is why the very
next sentence of Buckley said, “But Congress’ power . . . is inevitably
bounded by the express language” of the Constitution. 424 U. S., at
138–139 (emphasis added).
   6 The dissent attributes to Madison a belief that some executive offi­

cers, such as the Comptroller, could be made independent of the Presi­
dent. See post, at 17–18. But Madison’s actual proposal, consistent
with his view of the Constitution, was that the Comptroller hold office

                    Opinion of the Court 


   The Framers created a structure in which “[a] depend­
ence on the people” would be the “primary controul on the
government.” The Federalist No. 51, at 349 (J. Madison).
That dependence is maintained, not just by “parchment
barriers,” id., No. 48, at 333 (same), but by letting
“[a]mbition . . . counteract ambition,” giving each branch
“the necessary constitutional means, and personal mo­
tives, to resist encroachments of the others,” id., No. 51, at
349. A key “constitutional means” vested in the Presi­
dent—perhaps the key means—was “the power of appoint­
ing, overseeing, and controlling those who execute the
laws.” 1 Annals of Cong., at 463. And while a government
of “opposite and rival interests” may sometimes inhibit the
smooth functioning of administration, The Federalist No.
51, at 349, “[t]he Framers recognized that, in the long
term, structural protections against abuse of power were
critical to preserving liberty.” Bowsher, supra, at 730.
   Calls to abandon those protections in light of “the era’s
perceived necessity,” New York, 505 U. S., at 187, are not
unusual. Nor is the argument from bureaucratic expertise
limited only to the field of accounting. The failures of
accounting regulation may be a “pressing national prob­
lem,” but “a judiciary that licensed extraconstitutional
government with each issue of comparable gravity would,
in the long run, be far worse.” Id., at 187–188. Neither
respondents nor the dissent explains why the Board’s
task, unlike so many others, requires more than one layer
of insulation from the President—or, for that matter, why
only two. The point is not to take issue with for-cause
limitations in general; we do not do that. The question
here is far more modest. We deal with the unusual situa­

tion, never before addressed by the Court, of two layers of
for-cause tenure. And though it may be criticized as “ele­
mentary arithmetical logic,” post, at 23, two layers are not
the same as one.
   The President has been given the power to oversee
executive officers; he is not limited, as in Harry Truman’s
lament, to “persuad[ing]” his unelected subordinates “to do
what they ought to do without persuasion.” Post, at 11
(internal quotation marks omitted). In its pursuit of a
“workable government,” Congress cannot reduce the Chief
Magistrate to a cajoler-in-chief.

  The United States concedes that some constraints on
the removal of inferior executive officers might violate the
Constitution. See Brief for United States 47. It contends,
however, that the removal restrictions at issue here do
not.
  To begin with, the Government argues that the Com­
mission’s removal power over the Board is “broad,” and
could be construed as broader still, if necessary to avoid
invalidation. See, e.g., id., at 51, and n. 19; cf. PCAOB
Brief 22–23. But the Government does not contend that
simple disagreement with the Board’s policies or priorities
could constitute “good cause” for its removal. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 41–43, 45–46. Nor do our precedents suggest as
much. Humphrey’s Executor, for example, rejected a
removal premised on a lack of agreement “ ‘on either the
policies or the administering of the Federal Trade Com­
mission,’ ” because the FTC was designed to be “ ‘inde­
pendent in character,’ ” “free from ‘political domination or
control,’ ” and not “ ‘subject to anybody in the government’ ”
or “ ‘to the orders of the President.’ ” 295 U. S., at 619, 625.
Accord, Morrison, 487 U. S., at 693 (noting that “the con­
gressional determination to limit the removal power of the

sary independence of the office”); Wiener v. United States,
357 U. S. 349, 356 (1958) (describing for-cause removal as
“involving the rectitude” of an officer). And here there is
judicial review of any effort to remove Board members, see
15 U. S. C. §78y(a)(1), so the Commission will not have the
final word on the propriety of its own removal orders. The
removal restrictions set forth in the statute mean what
they say.
   Indeed, this case presents an even more serious threat
to executive control than an “ordinary” dual for-cause
standard. Congress enacted an unusually high standard
that must be met before Board members may be removed.
A Board member cannot be removed except for willful
violations of the Act, Board rules, or the securities laws;
willful abuse of authority; or unreasonable failure to en­
force compliance—as determined in a formal Commission
order, rendered on the record and after notice and an
opportunity for a hearing. §7217(d)(3); see §78y(a). The
Act does not even give the Commission power to fire Board
members for violations of other laws that do not relate to
the Act, the securities laws, or the Board’s authority. The
President might have less than full confidence in, say, a
Board member who cheats on his taxes; but that discovery
is not listed among the grounds for removal under
§7217(d)(3).7
   The rigorous standard that must be met before a Board
member may be removed was drawn from statutes con­
——————
   7 The Government implausibly argues that §7217(d)(3) “does not ex­

pressly make its three specified grounds of removal exclusive,” and that
“the Act could be construed to permit other grounds.” Brief for United
States 51, n. 19. But having provided in §7211(e)(6) that Board mem­
bers are to be removed “in accordance with [§7217(d)(3)], for good cause
shown,” Congress would not have specified the necessary Commission
finding in §7217(d)(3)—including formal procedures and detailed
conditions—if Board members could also be removed without any
finding at all. Cf. PCAOB Brief 6 (“Cause exists where” the §7217(d)(3)
conditions are met).

cerning private organizations like the New York Stock
Exchange. Cf. §§78s(h)(4), 7217(d)(3). While we need not
decide the question here, a removal standard appropriate
for limiting Government control over private bodies may
be inappropriate for officers wielding the executive power
of the United States.
   Alternatively, respondents portray the Act’s limitations
on removal as irrelevant, because—as the Court of Ap­
peals held—the Commission wields “at-will removal power
over Board functions if not Board members.” 537 F. 3d, at
683 (emphasis added); accord, Brief for United States 27–
28; PCAOB Brief 48. The Commission’s general “oversight
and enforcement authority over the Board,” §7217(a), is
said to “blun[t] the constitutional impact of for-cause
removal,” 537 F. 3d, at 683, and to leave the President no
worse off than “if Congress had lodged the Board’s func­
tions in the SEC’s own staff,” PCAOB Brief 15.
   Broad power over Board functions is not equivalent to
the power to remove Board members. The Commission
may, for example, approve the Board’s budget, §7219(b),
issue binding regulations, §§7202(a), 7217(b)(5), relieve
the Board of authority, §7217(d)(1), amend Board sanc­
tions, §7217(c), or enforce Board rules on its own,
§§7202(b)(1), (c). But altering the budget or powers of an
agency as a whole is a problematic way to control an infe­
rior officer. The Commission cannot wield a free hand to
supervise individual members if it must destroy the Board
in order to fix it.
   Even if Commission power over Board activities could
substitute for authority over its members, we would still
reject respondents’ premise that the Commission’s power
in this regard is plenary. As described above, the Board is
empowered to take significant enforcement actions, and
does so largely independently of the Commission. See
supra, at 3–4. Its powers are, of course, subject to some
latent Commission control. See supra, at 4–5. But the Act

                    Opinion of the Court 


nowhere gives the Commission effective power to start,
stop, or alter individual Board investigations, executive
activities typically carried out by officials within the Ex­
ecutive Branch.
  The Government and the dissent suggest that the Com­
mission could govern and direct the Board’s daily exercise
of prosecutorial discretion by promulgating new SEC
rules, or by amending those of the Board. Brief for United
States 27; post, at 15. Enacting general rules through the
required notice and comment procedures is obviously a
poor means of micromanaging the Board’s affairs. See
§§78s(c), 7215(b)(1), 7217(b)(5); cf. 5 U. S. C. §553, 15
U. S. C. §7202(a), PCAOB Brief 24, n. 6.8 So the Govern­
ment offers another proposal, that the Commission require
the Board by rule to “secure SEC approval for any actions
that it now may take itself.” Brief for United States 27.
That would surely constitute one of the “limitations upon
the activities, functions, and operations of the Board” that
the Act forbids, at least without Commission findings
equivalent to those required to fire the Board instead.
§7217(d)(2). The Board thus has significant independence
in determining its priorities and intervening in the affairs
of regulated firms (and the lives of their associated per­
sons) without Commission preapproval or direction.
  Finally, respondents suggest that our conclusion is
contradicted by the past practice of Congress. But the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act is highly unusual in committing
substantial executive authority to officers protected by two
layers of for-cause removal—including at one level a
sharply circumscribed definition of what constitutes “good

  8 Contrary to the dissent’s assertions, see post, at 15–16, the Commis­

sion’s powers to conduct its own investigations (with its own resources),
to remove particular provisions of law from the Board’s bailiwick, or to
require the Board to perform functions “other” than inspections and
investigations, §7211(c)(5), are no more useful in directing individual
enforcement actions.

cause,” and rigorous procedures that must be followed
prior to removal.
  The parties have identified only a handful of isolated
positions in which inferior officers might be protected by
two levels of good-cause tenure. See, e.g., PCAOB Brief
43. As Judge Kavanaugh noted in dissent below:
     “Perhaps the most telling indication of the severe con­
     stitutional problem with the PCAOB is the lack of his­
     torical precedent for this entity. Neither the majority
     opinion nor the PCAOB nor the United States as in­
     tervenor has located any historical analogues for this
     novel structure. They have not identified any inde­
     pendent agency other than the PCAOB that is ap­
     pointed by and removable only for cause by another
     independent agency.” 537 F. 3d, at 669.
   The dissent here suggests that other such positions
might exist, and complains that we do not resolve their
status in this opinion. Post, at 23–31. The dissent itself,
however, stresses the very size and variety of the Federal
Government, see post, at 7–8, and those features discour­
age general pronouncements on matters neither briefed
nor argued here. In any event, the dissent fails to support
its premonitions of doom; none of the positions it identifies
are similarly situated to the Board. See post, at 28–31.
   For example, many civil servants within independent
agencies would not qualify as “Officers of the United
States,” who “exercis[e] significant authority pursuant to
the laws of the United States,” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 126.9
The parties here concede that Board members are execu­
tive “Officers,” as that term is used in the Constitution.

                    Opinion of the Court 


See supra, at 4; see also Art. II, §2, cl. 2. We do not decide
the status of other Government employees, nor do we
decide whether “lesser functionaries subordinate to offi­
cers of the United States” must be subject to the same sort
of control as those who exercise “significant authority
pursuant to the laws.” Buckley, supra, at 126, and n. 162.
   Nor do the employees referenced by the dissent enjoy
the same significant and unusual protections from Presi­
dential oversight as members of the Board. Senior or
policymaking positions in government may be excepted
from the competitive service to ensure Presidential con­
trol, see 5 U. S. C. §§2302(a)(2)(B), 3302, 7511(b)(2), and
members of the Senior Executive Service may be reas­
signed or reviewed by agency heads (and entire agencies
may be excluded from that Service by the President), see,
e.g., §§3132(c), 3395(a), 4312(d), 4314(b)(3), (c)(3); cf.
§2302(a)(2)(B)(ii). While the full extent of that authority
is not before us, any such authority is of course wholly
absent with respect to the Board. Nothing in our opinion,
therefore, should be read to cast doubt on the use of what
is colloquially known as the civil service system within
independent agencies.10
   Finally, the dissent wanders far afield when it suggests
that today’s opinion might increase the President’s author­
——————
   10 For similar reasons, our holding also does not address that subset

of independent agency employees who serve as administrative law
judges. See, e.g., 5 U. S. C. §§556(c), 3105. Whether administrative law
judges are necessarily “Officers of the United States” is disputed. See,
e.g., Landry v. FDIC, 204 F. 3d 1125 (CADC 2000). And unlike mem­
bers of the Board, many administrative law judges of course perform
adjudicative rather than enforcement or policymaking functions, see
§§554(d), 3105, or possess purely recommendatory powers. The Gov­
ernment below refused to identify either “civil service tenure-protected
employees in independent agencies” or administrative law judges as
“precedent for the PCAOB.” 537 F. 3d 667, 699, n. 8 (CADC 2008)

ity to remove military officers. Without expressing any
view whatever on the scope of that authority, it is enough
to note that we see little analogy between our Nation’s
armed services and the Public Company Accounting Over­
sight Board. Military officers are broadly subject to Presi­
dential control through the chain of command and through
the President’s powers as Commander in Chief. Art. II,
§2, cl. 1; see, e.g., 10 U. S. C. §§162, 164(g). The President
and his subordinates may also convene boards of inquiry
or courts-martial to hear claims of misconduct or poor
performance by those officers. See, e.g., §§822(a)(1),
823(a)(1), 892(3), 933–934, 1181–1185. Here, by contrast,
the President has no authority to initiate a Board mem­
ber’s removal for cause.
   There is no reason for us to address whether these
positions identified by the dissent, or any others not at
issue in this case, are so structured as to infringe the
President’s constitutional authority. Nor is there any
substance to the dissent’s concern that the “work of all
these various officials” will “be put on hold.” Post, at 31.
As the judgment in this case demonstrates, restricting
certain officers to a single level of insulation from the
President affects the conditions under which those officers
might some day be removed, and would have no effect,
absent a congressional determination to the contrary, on
the validity of any officer’s continuance in office. The only
issue in this case is whether Congress may deprive the
President of adequate control over the Board, which is the
regulator of first resort and the primary law enforcement
authority for a vital sector of our economy. We hold that it
cannot.

Constitution. App. 46. We reject such a broad holding.
Instead, we agree with the Government that the unconsti­
tutional tenure provisions are severable from the remain­
der of the statute.
   “Generally speaking, when confronting a constitutional
flaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to the prob­
lem,” severing any “problematic portions while leaving the
remainder intact.”       Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of
Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 328–329 (2006). Be­
cause “[t]he unconstitutionality of a part of an Act does not
necessarily defeat or affect the validity of its remaining
provisions,” Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation
Comm’n of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234 (1932), the “normal
rule” is “that partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the
required course,” Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472
U. S. 491, 504 (1985). Putting to one side petitioners’
Appointments Clause challenges (addressed below), the
existence of the Board does not violate the separation of
powers, but the substantive removal restrictions imposed
by §§7211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) do. Under the traditional
default rule, removal is incident to the power of appoint­
ment. See, e.g., Sampson v. Murray, 415 U. S. 61, 70,
n. 17 (1974); Myers, 272 U. S., at 119; Ex parte Hennen, 13
Pet., at 259–260. Concluding that the removal restrictions
are invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission
at will, and leaves the President separated from Board
members by only a single level of good-cause tenure. The
Commission is then fully responsible for the Board’s ac­
tions, which are no less subject than the Commission’s
own functions to Presidential oversight.
   The Sarbanes-Oxley Act remains “ ‘fully operative as a
law’ ” with these tenure restrictions excised. New York,
505 U. S., at 186 (quoting Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock,
480 U. S. 678, 684 (1987)). We therefore must sustain its
remaining provisions “[u]nless it is evident that the Legis­
lature would not have enacted those provisions . . . inde­

pendently of that which is [invalid].” Ibid. (internal quo­
tation marks omitted). Though this inquiry can some­
times be “elusive,” Chadha, 462 U. S., at 932, the answer
here seems clear: The remaining provisions are not “inca­
pable of functioning independently,” Alaska Airlines, 480
U. S., at 684, and nothing in the statute’s text or historical
context makes it “evident” that Congress, faced with the
limitations imposed by the Constitution, would have pre­
ferred no Board at all to a Board whose members are
removable at will. Ibid.; see also Ayotte, supra, at 330.
  It is true that the language providing for good-cause
removal is only one of a number of statutory provisions
that, working together, produce a constitutional violation.
In theory, perhaps, the Court might blue-pencil a suffi­
cient number of the Board’s responsibilities so that its
members would no longer be “Officers of the United
States.” Or we could restrict the Board’s enforcement
powers, so that it would be a purely recommendatory
panel. Or the Board members could in future be made
removable by the President, for good cause or at will. But
such editorial freedom—far more extensive than our hold­
ing today—belongs to the Legislature, not the Judiciary.
Congress of course remains free to pursue any of these
options going forward.
                             V
  Petitioners raise three more challenges to the Board
under the Appointments Clause. None has merit.
  First, petitioners argue that Board members are princi­
pal officers requiring Presidential appointment with the
Senate’s advice and consent. We held in Edmond v.
United States, 520 U. S. 651, 662–663 (1997), that
“[w]hether one is an ‘inferior’ officer depends on whether
he has a superior,” and that “ ‘inferior officers’ are officers
whose work is directed and supervised at some level” by
other officers appointed by the President with the Senate’s

consent. In particular, we noted that “[t]he power to
remove officers” at will and without cause “is a powerful
tool for control” of an inferior. Id., at 664. As explained
above, the statutory restrictions on the Commission’s
power to remove Board members are unconstitutional and
void. Given that the Commission is properly viewed,
under the Constitution, as possessing the power to remove
Board members at will, and given the Commission’s other
oversight authority, we have no hesitation in concluding
that under Edmond the Board members are inferior offi­
cers whose appointment Congress may permissibly vest in
a “Hea[d] of Departmen[t].”
   But, petitioners argue, the Commission is not a “De­
partmen[t]” like the “Executive departments” (e.g., State,
Treasury, Defense) listed in 5 U. S. C. §101. In Freytag,
501 U. S., at 887, n. 4, we specifically reserved the ques­
tion whether a “principal agenc[y], such as . . . the Securi­
ties and Exchange Commission,” is a “Departmen[t]”
under the Appointments Clause. Four Justices, however,
would have concluded that the Commission is indeed such
a “Departmen[t],” see id., at 918 (SCALIA, J., concurring in
part and concurring in judgment), because it is a “free­
standing, self-contained entity in the Executive Branch,”
id., at 915.
   Respondents urge us to adopt this reasoning as to those
entities not addressed by our opinion in Freytag, see Brief
for United States 37–39; PCAOB Brief 30–33, and we do.
Respondents’ reading of the Appointments Clause is con­
sistent with the common, near-contemporary definition of
a “department” as a “separate allotment or part of busi­
ness; a distinct province, in which a class of duties are
allotted to a particular person.” 1 N. Webster, American
Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (def. 2) (1995
facsimile ed.). It is also consistent with the early practice
of Congress, which in 1792 authorized the Postmaster
General to appoint “an assistant, and deputy postmasters,
                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   31

at all places where such shall be found necessary,” §3, 1
Stat. 234—thus treating him as the “Hea[d] of [a] De­
partmen[t]” without the title of Secretary or any role in
the President’s Cabinet. And it is consistent with our
prior cases, which have never invalidated an appointment
made by the head of such an establishment. See Freytag,
supra, at 917; cf. Burnap v. United States, 252 U. S. 512,
515 (1920); United States v. Germaine, 99 U. S. 508, 511
(1879). Because the Commission is a freestanding compo­
nent of the Executive Branch, not subordinate to or con­
tained within any other such component, it constitutes a
“Departmen[t]” for the purposes of the Appointments
Clause.11
   But petitioners are not done yet. They argue that the
full Commission cannot constitutionally appoint Board
members, because only the Chairman of the Commission
is the Commission’s “Hea[d].”12 The Commission’s powers,
however, are generally vested in the Commissioners
jointly, not the Chairman alone. See, e.g., 15 U. S. C.
§§77s, 77t, 78u, 78w. The Commissioners do not report to
the Chairman, who exercises administrative and executive
functions subject to the full Commission’s policies. See
——————
   11 We express no view on whether the Commission is thus an “execu­

tive Departmen[t]” under the Opinions Clause, Art. II, §2, cl. 1, or
under Section 4 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. See Freytag v.
Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 886–887 (1991).
   12 The Board argued below that petitioners lack standing to raise this

claim, because no member of the Board has been appointed over the
Chairman’s objection, and so petitioners’ injuries are not fairly trace­
able to an invalid appointment. See Defendants’ Memorandum of
Points and Authorities in Support of Motion to Dismiss the Complaint
in Civil Action No. 1:06–cv–00217–JR (DC), Doc. 17, pp. 42–43; Brief
for Appellees PCAOB et al. in No. 07–5127 (CADC), pp. 32–33. We
cannot assume, however, that the Chairman would have made the
same appointments acting alone; and petitioners’ standing does not
require precise proof of what the Board’s policies might have been in
that counterfactual world. See Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530,
533 (1962) (plurality opinion).

Reorg. Plan No. 10 of 1950, §1(b)(1), 64 Stat. 1265. The
Chairman is also appointed from among the Commission­
ers by the President alone, id., §3, at 1266, which means
that he cannot be regarded as “the head of an agency” for
purposes of the Reorganization Act. See 5 U. S. C. §904.
(The Commission as a whole, on the other hand, does meet
the requirements of the Act, including its provision that
“the head of an agency [may] be an individual or a com­
mission or board with more than one member.”)13
   As a constitutional matter, we see no reason why a
multimember body may not be the “Hea[d]” of a “Depart­
men[t]” that it governs. The Appointments Clause neces­
sarily contemplates collective appointments by the “Courts
of Law,” Art. II, §2, cl. 2, and each House of Congress, too,
appoints its officers collectively, see Art. I, §2, cl. 5; id., §3,
cl. 5. Petitioners argue that the Framers vested the nomi­
nation of principal officers in the President to avoid the
perceived evils of collective appointments, but they reveal
no similar concern with respect to inferior officers, whose
appointments may be vested elsewhere, including in mul­
timember bodies. Practice has also sanctioned the ap­
pointment of inferior officers by multimember agencies.
See Freytag, supra, at 918 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment); see also Classification Act of
1923, ch. 265, §2, 42 Stat. 1488 (defining “the head of the

  13 Petitionerscontend that finding the Commission to be the head will
invalidate numerous appointments made directly by the Chairman,
such as those of the “heads of major [SEC] administrative units.”
Reorg. Plan No. 10, §1(b)(2), at 1266. Assuming, however, that these
individuals are officers of the United States, their appointment is still
made “subject to the approval of the Commission.” Ibid. We have
previously found that the department head’s approval satisfies the
Appointments Clause, in precedents that petitioners do not ask us to
revisit. See, e.g., United States v. Smith, 124 U. S. 525, 532 (1888);

Gen. 227, 231 (1933) (endorsing collective appointment by
the Civil Service Commission). We conclude that the
Board members have been validly appointed by the full
Commission.
   In light of the foregoing, petitioners are not entitled to
broad injunctive relief against the Board’s continued
operations. But they are entitled to declaratory relief
sufficient to ensure that the reporting requirements and
auditing standards to which they are subject will be en­
forced only by a constitutional agency accountable to the
Executive. See Bowsher, 478 U. S., at 727, n. 5 (conclud­
ing that a separation of powers violation may create a
“here-and-now” injury that can be remedied by a court
(internal quotation marks omitted)).
                       *     *    *
  The Constitution that makes the President accountable
to the people for executing the laws also gives him the
power to do so. That power includes, as a general matter,
the authority to remove those who assist him in carrying
out his duties. Without such power, the President could
not be held fully accountable for discharging his own
responsibilities; the buck would stop somewhere else.
Such diffusion of authority “would greatly diminish the
intended and necessary responsibility of the chief magis­
trate himself.” The Federalist No. 70, at 478.
  While we have sustained in certain cases limits on the
President’s removal power, the Act before us imposes a
new type of restriction—two levels of protection from
removal for those who nonetheless exercise significant
executive power. Congress cannot limit the President’s
authority in this way.

    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

                        [June 28, 2010] 


  JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE
GINSBURG, and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, dissenting.
  The Court holds unconstitutional a statute providing
that the Securities and Exchange Commission can remove
members of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board from office only for cause. It argues that granting
the “inferior officer[s]” on the Accounting Board “more
than one level of good-cause protection . . . contravenes the
President’s ‘constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful
execution of the laws.’ ” Ante, at 2. I agree that the Ac
counting Board members are inferior officers. See ante, at
28–29. But in my view the statute does not significantly
interfere with the President’s “executive Power.” Art. II,
§1. It violates no separation-of-powers principle. And the
Court’s contrary holding threatens to disrupt severely the
fair and efficient administration of the laws. I conse
quently dissent.

  The legal question before us arises at the intersection of
two general constitutional principles. On the one hand,
Congress has broad power to enact statutes “necessary
and proper” to the exercise of its specifically enumerated
2       FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

                  BREYER, J., dissenting 


constitutional authority. Art. I, §8, cl. 18. As Chief Jus
tice Marshall wrote for the Court nearly 200 years ago, the
Necessary and Proper Clause reflects the Framers’ efforts
to create a Constitution that would “endure for ages to
come.” McCulloch v. Maryland, <span class="citation">
         <a href="/scotus/7LyH/mcculloch-v-maryland/">
            <span class="volume">4</span>

            <span class="page">316</span>
         </a>
      </span>, 415 (1819).
It embodies their recognition that it would be “unwise” to
prescribe “the means by which government should, in all
future time, execute its powers.” Ibid. Such “immutable
rules” would deprive the Government of the needed flexi
bility to respond to future “exigencies which, if foreseen at
all, must have been seen dimly.” Ibid. Thus the Neces
sary and Proper Clause affords Congress broad authority
to “create” governmental “ ‘offices’ ” and to structure those
offices “as it chooses.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 138
(1976) (per curiam); cf. Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 355
(1903). And Congress has drawn on that power over the
past century to create numerous federal agencies in re
sponse to “various crises of human affairs” as they have
arisen. McCulloch, supra, at 415 (emphasis deleted). Cf.
Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U. S. 33, 36–37 (1950).
   On the other hand, the opening sections of Articles I, II,
and III of the Constitution separately and respectively
vest “all legislative Powers” in Congress, the “executive
Power” in the President, and the “judicial Power” in the
Supreme Court (and such “inferior Courts as Congress
may from time to time ordain and establish”). In doing so,
these provisions imply a structural separation-of-powers
principle. See, e.g., Miller v. French, 530 U. S. 327, 341–
342 (2000). And that principle, along with the instruction
in Article II, §3 that the President “shall take Care that
the Laws be faithfully executed,” limits Congress’ power to
structure the Federal Government. See, e.g., INS v.
Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 946 (1983); Freytag v. Commis
sioner, 501 U. S. 868, 878 (1991); Northern Pipeline
Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 64
(1982); Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, 478

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

U. S. 833, 859–860 (1986). Indeed, this Court has held
that the separation-of-powers principle guarantees the
President the authority to dismiss certain Executive
Branch officials at will. Myers v. United States, 272 U. S.
52 (1926).
   But neither of these two principles is absolute in its
application to removal cases. The Necessary and Proper
Clause does not grant Congress power to free all Execu
tive Branch officials from dismissal at the will of the
President. Ibid. Nor does the separation-of-powers prin
ciple grant the President an absolute authority to remove
any and all Executive Branch officials at will. Rather,
depending on, say, the nature of the office, its function, or
its subject matter, Congress sometimes may, consistent
with the Constitution, limit the President’s authority to
remove an officer from his post. See Humphrey’s Executor
v. United States, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), overruling in part
Myers, supra; Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988).
And we must here decide whether the circumstances
surrounding the statute at issue justify such a limitation.
   In answering the question presented, we cannot look to
more specific constitutional text, such as the text of the
Appointments Clause or the Presentment Clause, upon
which the Court has relied in other separation-of-powers
cases. See, e.g., Chadha, supra, at 946; Buckley, supra, at
124–125. That is because, with the exception of the gen
eral “vesting” and “take care” language, the Constitution
is completely “silent with respect to the power of removal
from office.” Ex parte Hennen, <span class="citation no-link">

also Morrison, supra, at 723 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)
(“There is, of course, no provision in the Constitution
stating who may remove executive officers . . . ”).
   Nor does history offer significant help. The President’s
power to remove Executive Branch officers “was not dis
cussed in the Constitutional Convention.” Myers, supra,
at 109–110. The First Congress enacted federal statutes

              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

                  BREYER, J., dissenting 


that limited the President’s ability to oversee Executive
Branch officials, including the Comptroller of the United
States, federal district attorneys (precursors to today’s
United States Attorneys), and, to a lesser extent, the
Secretary of the Treasury. See, e.g., Lessig, Readings By
Our Unitary Executive, 15 Cardozo L. Rev. 175, 183–184
(1993); Teifer, The Constitutionality of Independent Offi
cers as Checks on Abuses of Executive Power, 63 B. U. L.

Mary L. Rev. 211, 240–241 (1989) (hereinafter Casper); H.
Bruff, Balance of Forces: Separation of Powers in the
Administrative State 414–417 (2006). But those statutes
did not directly limit the President’s authority to remove
any of those officials—“a subject” that was “much dis
puted” during “the early history of this government,” “and
upon which a great diversity of opinion was entertained.”

      </span>, 306 (1855) (McLean, J.,
dissenting); Casper 233–237 (recounting the Debate of
1789). Scholars, like Members of this Court, have contin
ued to disagree, not only about the inferences that should
be drawn from the inconclusive historical record, but also
about the nature of the original disagreement. Compare
ante, at 11; Myers, supra, at 114 (majority opinion of Taft,
C. J.); and Prakash, New Light on the Decision of 1789, 91
Cornell L. Rev. 1021 (2006), with, e.g., Myers, supra, at

(hereinafter Lessig &amp; Sunstein); and L. Fisher, President
and Congress: Power and Policy 86–89 (1972).
   Nor does this Court’s precedent fully answer the ques
tion presented. At least it does not clearly invalidate the
provision in dispute. See Part II–C, infra. In Myers,
                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            5

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

supra, the Court invalidated—for the first and only time—
a congressional statute on the ground that it unduly lim
ited the President’s authority to remove an Executive
Branch official. But soon thereafter the Court expressly
disapproved most of Myers’ broad reasoning. See Hum
phrey’s Executor, 295 U. S., at 626–627, overruling in part
Myers, supra; Wiener v. United States, 357 U. S. 349, 352
(1958) (stating that Humphrey’s Executor “explicitly ‘dis
approved’ ” of much of the reasoning in Myers). Moreover,
the Court has since said that “the essence of the decision
in Myers was the judgment that the Constitution prevents
Congress from ‘draw[ing] to itself . . . the power to remove
or the right to participate in the exercise of that power.’ ”
Morrison, supra, at 686 (emphasis added). And that fea
ture of the statute—a feature that would aggrandize the
power of Congress—is not present here. Congress has not
granted itself any role in removing the members of the
Accounting Board. Cf. Freytag, 501 U. S., at 878 (“separa
tion-of-powers jurisprudence generally focuses on the
danger of one branch’s aggrandizing its power at the
expense of another branch” (emphasis added)); Buckley,
424 U. S., at 129 (same); Schor, 478 U. S., at 856 (same);
Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 727 (1986) (same). Com
pare Myers, supra, (striking down statute where Congress
granted itself removal authority over Executive Branch
official), with Humphrey’s Executor, supra, (upholding
statute where such aggrandizing was absent); Wiener,
supra (same); Morrison, supra (same).
   In short, the question presented lies at the intersection
of two sets of conflicting, broadly framed constitutional
principles. And no text, no history, perhaps no precedent
provides any clear answer. Cf. Chicago v. Morales, 527
U. S. 41, 106 (1999) (THOMAS, J., joined by Rehnquist,
C. J., and SCALIA, J., dissenting) (expressing the view that
“this Court” is “most vulnerable” when “it deals with
judge-made constitutional law” that lacks “roots in the

language” of the Constitution (internal quotation marks
omitted)).
                             B
   When previously deciding this kind of nontextual ques
tion, the Court has emphasized the importance of examin
ing how a particular provision, taken in context, is likely
to function. Thus, in Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 53
(1932), a foundational separation-of-powers case, the
Court said that “regard must be had, as in other cases
where constitutional limits are invoked, not to mere mat
ters of form, but to the substance of what is required.”
The Court repeated this injunction in Schor and again in
Morrison. See Schor, supra, at 854 (stating that the Court
must look “ ‘beyond form to the substance of what’ Con
gress has done”); Morrison, 487 U. S., at 689–690 (“The
analysis contained in our removal cases is designed not to
define rigid categories of those officials who may or may
not be removed at will by the President,” but rather asks
whether, given the “functions of the officials in question,”
a removal provision “interfere[s] with the President’s
exercise of the ‘executive power’ ” (emphasis added)). The
Court has thereby written into law Justice Jackson’s wise
perception that “the Constitution . . . contemplates that
practice will integrate the dispersed powers into a worka
ble government.” Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer,
343 U. S. 579, 635 (1952) (opinion concurring in judgment)
(emphasis added). See also ibid. (“The actual art of gov
erning under our Constitution does not and cannot con
form to judicial definitions of the power of any of its
branches based on isolated clauses or even single Articles
torn from context”).
   It is not surprising that the Court in these circum
stances has looked to function and context, and not to
bright-line rules. For one thing, that approach embodies
the intent of the Framers. As Chief Justice Marshall long
                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           7

                    BREYER, J., dissenting

ago observed, our Constitution is fashioned so as to allow
the three coordinate branches, including this Court, to
exercise practical judgment in response to changing condi
tions and “exigencies,” which at the time of the founding
could be seen only “dimly,” and perhaps not at all.
McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 415.
   For another, a functional approach permits Congress
and the President the flexibility needed to adapt statutory
law to changing circumstances. That is why the “powers
conferred upon the Federal Government by the Constitu
tion were phrased in language broad enough to allow for
the expansion of the Federal Government’s role” over time.
New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 157 (1992).
Indeed, the Federal Government at the time of the found
ing consisted of about 2,000 employees and served a popu
lation of about 4 million. See Kaufman, The Growth of the
Federal Personnel System, in The Federal Government
Service 7, 8 (W. Sayre 2d ed. 1965); Dept. of Commerce,
Census Bureau, Historical Statistics of the United States:
Colonial Times to 1970, pt. 1, p. 8 (1975). Today, however,
the Federal Government employs about 4.4 million work
ers who serve a Nation of more than 310 million people
living in a society characterized by rapid technological,
economic, and social change. See Office of Management
and Budget, Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U. S.
Government, Fiscal Year 2010, p. 368 (2009).
   Federal statutes now require or permit Government
officials to provide, regulate, or otherwise administer, not
only foreign affairs and defense, but also a wide variety of
such subjects as taxes, welfare, social security, medicine,
pharmaceutical drugs, education, highways, railroads,
electricity, natural gas, nuclear power, financial instru
ments, banking, medical care, public health and safety,
the environment, fair employment practices, consumer
protection and much else besides. Those statutes create a
host of different organizational structures. Sometimes

they delegate administrative authority to the President
directly, e.g., 10 U. S. C. §2031(a)(1); 42 U. S. C. §5192(c);
sometimes they place authority in a long-established
Cabinet department, e.g., 7 U. S. C. §1637b(c)(1); 12
U. S. C. §5221(b)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. II); sometimes they
delegate authority to an independent commission or board,
e.g., 15 U. S. C. §4404(b); 28 U. S. C. §994; sometimes they
place authority directly in the hands of a single senior
administrator, e.g., 15 U. S. C. §657d(c)(4); 42 U. S. C.
§421; sometimes they place it in a sub-cabinet bureau,
office, division or other agency, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §4048;
sometimes they vest it in multimember or multiagency
task groups, e.g. 5 U. S. C. §§593–594; 50 U. S. C. §402
(2006 ed. and Supp. II); sometimes they vest it in commis
sions or advisory committees made up of members of more
than one branch, e.g., 20 U. S. C. §42(a); 28 U. S. C.
§991(a) (2006 ed., Supp. II); 42 U. S. C. §1975; sometimes
they divide it among groups of departments, commissions,
bureaus, divisions, and administrators, e.g., 5 U. S. C.
§9902(a) (2006 ed., Supp. II); 7 U. S. C. §136i–1(g); and
sometimes they permit state or local governments to
participate as well, e.g., 7 U. S. C. §2009aa–1(a). Statutes
similarly grant administrators a wide variety of powers—
for example, the power to make rules, develop informal
practices, investigate, adjudicate, impose sanctions, grant
licenses, and provide goods, services, advice, and so forth.
See generally 5 U. S. C. §500 et seq.
   The upshot is that today vast numbers of statutes gov
erning vast numbers of subjects, concerned with vast
numbers of different problems, provide for, or foresee,
their execution or administration through the work of
administrators organized within many different kinds of
administrative structures, exercising different kinds of
administrative authority, to achieve their legislatively
mandated objectives. And, given the nature of the Gov
ernment’s work, it is not surprising that administrative

units come in many different shapes and sizes.
   The functional approach required by our precedents
recognizes this administrative complexity and, more im
portantly, recognizes the various ways presidential power
operates within this context—and the various ways in
which a removal provision might affect that power. As
human beings have known ever since Ulysses tied himself
to the mast so as safely to hear the Sirens’ song, some
times it is necessary to disable oneself in order to achieve
a broader objective. Thus, legally enforceable commit
ments—such as contracts, statutes that cannot instantly
be changed, and, as in the case before us, the establish
ment of independent administrative institutions—hold the
potential to empower precisely because of their ability to
constrain. If the President seeks to regulate through
impartial adjudication, then insulation of the adjudicator
from removal at will can help him achieve that goal. And
to free a technical decisionmaker from the fear of removal
without cause can similarly help create legitimacy with
respect to that official’s regulatory actions by helping to
insulate his technical decisions from nontechnical political
pressure.
   Neither is power always susceptible to the equations of
elementary arithmetic. A rule that takes power from a
President’s friends and allies may weaken him. But a rule
that takes power from the President’s opponents may
strengthen him. And what if the rule takes power from a
functionally neutral independent authority? In that case,
it is difficult to predict how the President’s power is af
fected in the abstract.
   These practical reasons not only support our precedents’
determination that cases such as this should examine the
specific functions and context at issue; they also indicate
that judges should hesitate before second-guessing a “for
cause” decision made by the other branches. See, e.g.,
Chadha, 462 U. S., at 944 (applying a “presumption that

the challenged statute is valid”); Bowsher, 478 U. S., at
736 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). Compared to
Congress and the President, the Judiciary possesses an
inferior understanding of the realities of administration,
and the manner in which power, including and most espe
cially political power, operates in context.
  There is no indication that the two comparatively more
expert branches were divided in their support for the “for
cause” provision at issue here. In this case, the Act em
bodying the provision was passed by a vote of 423 to 3 in
the House of Representatives and a by vote of 99 to 0 in the
Senate. 148 Cong. Rec. 14458, 14505 (2002). The creation
of the Accounting Board was discussed at great length in
both bodies without anyone finding in its structure any
constitutional problem. See id., at 12035–12037, 12112–
12132, 12315–12323, 12372–12377, 12488–12508, 12529–
12534, 12612–12618, 12673–12680, 12734–12751, 12915–
12960, 13347–13354, 14439–14458, 14487–14506. The
President signed the Act. And, when he did so, he issued a
signing statement that critiqued multiple provisions of the
Act but did not express any separation-of-powers concerns.
See President’s Statement on Signing the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, 30 Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 1286 (2002). Cf.

  Thus, here, as in similar cases, we should decide the
constitutional question in light of the provision’s practical
functioning in context. And our decision should take
account of the Judiciary’s comparative lack of institutional

   To what extent then is the Act’s “for cause” provision
likely, as a practical matter, to limit the President’s exer
cise of executive authority? In practical terms no “for
cause” provision can, in isolation, define the full measure
of executive power. This is because a legislative decision
to place ultimate administrative authority in, say, the
Secretary of Agriculture rather than the President, the
way in which the statute defines the scope of the power
the relevant administrator can exercise, the decision as to
who controls the agency’s budget requests and funding,
the relationships between one agency or department and
another, as well as more purely political factors (including
Congress’ ability to assert influence) are more likely to
affect the President’s power to get something done. That
is why President Truman complained that “ ‘the powers of
the President amount to’ ” bringing “ ‘people in and try[ing]
to persuade them to do what they ought to do without
persuasion.’ ” C. Rossiter, The American Presidency 154
(2d rev. ed. 1960). And that is why scholars have written
that the President “is neither dominant nor powerless” in
his relationships with many Government entities,
“whether denominated executive or independent.” Strauss,
The Place of Agencies in Government: Separation of Pow
ers and the Fourth Branch, 84 Colum. L. Rev. 573, 583
(1984) (hereinafter Strauss). Those entities “are all sub
ject to presidential direction in significant aspects of their
functioning, and [are each] able to resist presidential
direction in others.” Ibid. (emphasis added).
   Indeed, notwithstanding the majority’s assertion that
the removal authority is “the key” mechanism by which
the President oversees inferior officers in the independent
agencies, ante, at 20, it appears that no President has ever
12      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

                  BREYER, J., dissenting 


actually sought to exercise that power by testing the scope
of a “for cause” provision. See Bruff, Bringing the Inde
pendent Agencies in from the Cold, 62 Vanderbilt L. Rev.
En Banc 63, 68 (2009), online at http://vanderbiltlawreview.
org/articles/2009/11/Bruff-62-Vand-L-Rev-En-Banc-63.pdf
(noting that “Presidents do not test the limits of their
power by removing commissioners . . . ”); Lessig &amp; Sun
stein 110–112 (noting that courts have not had occasion to
define what constitutes “cause” because Presidents rarely
test removal provisions).
   But even if we put all these other matters to the side, we
should still conclude that the “for cause” restriction before
us will not restrict presidential power significantly. For
one thing, the restriction directly limits, not the Presi
dent’s power, but the power of an already independent
agency. The Court seems to have forgotten that fact when
it identifies its central constitutional problem: According
to the Court, the President “is powerless to intervene” if he
has determined that the Board members’ “conduct merit[s]
removal” because “[t]hat decision is vested instead in other
tenured officers—the Commissioners—none of whom is
subject to the President’s direct control.” Ante, at 14–15.
But so long as the President is legitimately foreclosed from
removing the Commissioners except for cause (as the
majority assumes), nullifying the Commission’s power to
remove Board members only for cause will not resolve the
problem the Court has identified: The President will still
be “powerless to intervene” by removing the Board mem
bers if the Commission reasonably decides not to do so.
   In other words, the Court fails to show why two layers of
“for cause” protection—Layer One insulating the Commis
sioners from the President, and Layer Two insulating the
Board from the Commissioners—impose any more serious
limitation upon the President’s powers than one layer.
Consider the four scenarios that might arise:
    1. The President and the Commission both want to
                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          13

                    BREYER, J., dissenting

        keep a Board member in office. Neither layer is
        relevant.
    2. The President and the Commission both want to
        dismiss a Board member. Layer Two stops them
        both from doing so without cause. The President’s
        ability to remove the Commission (Layer One) is
        irrelevant, for he and the Commission are in
        agreement.
    3. The President wants to dismiss a Board member,
        but the Commission wants to keep the member.
        Layer One allows the Commission to make that de
        termination notwithstanding the President’s con
        trary view. Layer Two is irrelevant because the
        Commission does not seek to remove the Board
        member.
    4. The President wants to keep a Board member, but
        the Commission wants to dismiss the Board mem
        ber. Here, Layer Two helps the President, for it
        hinders the Commission’s ability to dismiss a Board
        member whom the President wants to keep in
        place.
  Thus, the majority’s decision to eliminate only Layer
Two accomplishes virtually nothing. And that is because a
removal restriction’s effect upon presidential power de
pends not on the presence of a “double-layer” of for-cause
removal, as the majority pretends, but rather on the real
world nature of the President’s relationship with the
Commission. If the President confronts a Commission
that seeks to resist his policy preferences—a distinct pos
sibility when, as here, a Commission’s membership must
reflect both political parties, 15 U. S. C. §78d(a)—the
restriction on the Commission’s ability to remove a Board
member is either irrelevant (as in scenario 3) or may
actually help the President (as in scenario 4). And if the
President faces a Commission that seeks to implement his
policy preferences, Layer One is irrelevant, for the Presi
14      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

                  BREYER, J., dissenting 


dent and Commission see eye to eye.
  In order to avoid this elementary logic, the Court creates
two alternative scenarios. In the first, the Commission
and the President both want to remove a Board member,
but have varying judgments as to whether they have good
“cause” to do so—i.e., the President and the Commission
both conclude that a Board member should be removed,
but disagree as to whether that conclusion (which they
have both reached) is reasonable. Ante, at 14–15. In the
second, the President wants to remove a Board member
and the Commission disagrees; but, notwithstanding its
freedom to make reasonable decisions independent of the
President (afforded by Layer One), the Commission (while
apparently telling the President that it agrees with him
and would like to remove the Board member) uses Layer
Two as an “excuse” to pursue its actual aims—an excuse
which, given Layer One, it does not need. Ante, at 15, n. 4.
  Both of these circumstances seem unusual. I do not
know if they have ever occurred. But I do not deny their
logical possibility. I simply doubt their importance. And
the fact that, with respect to the President’s power, the
double layer of for-cause removal sometimes might help,
sometimes might hurt, leads me to conclude that its over
all effect is at most indeterminate.
  But once we leave the realm of hypothetical logic and
view the removal provision at issue in the context of the
entire Act, its lack of practical effect becomes readily
apparent. That is because the statute provides the Com
mission with full authority and virtually comprehensive
control over all of the Board’s functions. Those who cre
ated the Accounting Board modeled it, in terms of struc
ture and authority, upon the semiprivate regulatory bod
ies prevalent in the area of financial regulation, such as
the New York Stock Exchange and other similar self
regulating organizations. See generally Brief for Former
Chairmen of the SEC as Amici Curiae (hereinafter Brief
                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

for Former SEC Chairmen). And those organizations—
which rely on private financing and on officers drawn from
the private sector—exercise rulemaking and adjudicatory
authority that is pervasively controlled by, and is indeed
“entirely derivative” of, the SEC. See National Assn. of
Securities Dealers, Inc. v. SEC, 431 F. 3d 803, 806 (CADC
2005).
   Adhering to that model, the statute here gives the Ac
counting Board the power to adopt rules and standards
“relating to the preparation of audit reports”; to adjudicate
disciplinary proceedings involving accounting firms that
fail to follow these rules; to impose sanctions; and to en
gage in other related activities, such as conducting inspec
tions of accounting firms registered as the law requires
and investigations to monitor compliance with the rules
and related legal obligations. See 15 U. S. C. §§7211–
7216. But, at the same time,
    • No Accounting Board rule takes effect unless and
        until the Commission approves it, §7217(b)(2);
    • The Commission may “abrogat[e], delet[e] or ad[d] to”
        any rule or any portion of a rule promulgated by the
        Accounting Board whenever, in the Commission’s
        view, doing so “further[s] the purposes” of the securi
        ties and accounting-oversight laws, §7217(b)(5);
    • The Commission may review any sanction the
        Board imposes and “enhance, modify, cancel, re
        duce, or require the remission of” that sanction if it
        find’s the Board’s action not “appropriate,”
        §§7215(e), 7217(c)(3);
    • The Commission may promulgate rules restricting
        or directing the Accounting Board’s conduct of all
        inspections    and     investigations,   §§7211(c)(3),
        7214(h), 7215(b)(1)–(4);
    • The Commission may itself initiate any investigation
        or promulgate any rule within the Accounting
        Board’s purview, §7202, and may also remove any

        Accounting Board member who has unreasonably
        “failed to enforce compliance with” the relevant
        “rule[s], or any professional standard,” §7217(d)(3)(C)
        (emphasis added);
    • The Commission may at any time “relieve the Board
        of any responsibility to enforce compliance with any
        provision” of the Act, the rules, or professional stan
        dards if, in the Commission’s view, doing so is in
        “the public interest,” §7217(d)(1) (emphasis added).
   As these statutory provisions make clear, the Court is
simply wrong when it says that “the Act nowhere gives the
Commission effective power to start, stop, or alter” Board
investigations. Ante, at 23–24. On the contrary, the
Commission’s control over the Board’s investigatory and
legal functions is virtually absolute. Moreover, the Com
mission has general supervisory powers over the Account
ing Board itself: It controls the Board’s budget, §§7219(b),
(d)(1); it can assign to the Board any “duties or functions”
that it “determines are necessary or appropriate,”
§7211(c)(5); it has full “oversight and enforcement author
ity over the Board,” §7217(a), including the authority to
inspect the Board’s activities whenever it believes it “ap
propriate” to do so, §7217(d)(2) (emphasis added). And it
can censure the Board or its members, as well as remove
the members from office, if the members, for example, fail
to enforce the Act, violate any provisions of the Act, or
abuse the authority granted to them under the Act,
§7217(d)(3). Cf. Shurtleff v. United States, 189 U. S. 311,
314–319 (1903) (holding that removal authority is not
always “restricted to a removal for th[e] causes” set forth

Vand-L-Rev-En-Banc-85.pdf (explaining further the com
prehensive nature of the Commission’s powers).
   What is left? The Commission’s inability to remove a
Board member whose perfectly reasonable actions cause
the Commission to overrule him with great frequency?
What is the practical likelihood of that occurring, or, if it
does, of the President’s serious concern about such a mat
ter? Everyone concedes that the President’s control over
the Commission is constitutionally sufficient. See Hum
phrey’s Executor, 295 U. S. 602; Wiener, 357 U. S. 349;
ante, at 1–2. And if the President’s control over the Com
mission is sufficient, and the Commission’s control over
the Board is virtually absolute, then, as a practical matter,
the President’s control over the Board should prove suffi
cient as well.
                               B
   At the same time, Congress and the President had good
reason for enacting the challenged “for cause” provision.
First and foremost, the Board adjudicates cases. See 15
U. S. C. §7215. This Court has long recognized the appro
priateness of using “for cause” provisions to protect the
personal independence of those who even only sometimes
engage in adjudicatory functions. Humphrey’s Executor,
supra, at 623–628; see also Wiener, supra, at 355–356;
Morrison, 487 U. S., at 690–691, and n. 30; McAllister v.
United States, 141 U. S. 174, 191–201 (1891) (Field, J.,
dissenting). Indeed, as early as 1789 James Madison
stated that “there may be strong reasons why an” execu
tive “officer” such as the Comptroller of the United States
“should not hold his office at the pleasure of the Executive
branch” if one of his “principal dut[ies]” “partakes strongly
of the judicial character.” 1 Annals of Congress 611–612;
cf. ante, at 19, n. 6 (noting that the statute Congress ulti

              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

                  BREYER, J., dissenting 


mately enacted limited Presidential control over the
Comptroller in a different fashion); see supra, at 4. The
Court, however, all but ignores the Board’s adjudicatory
functions when conducting its analysis. See, e.g., ante, at
17–18. And when it finally does address that central
function (in a footnote), it simply asserts that the Board
does not “perform adjudicative . . . functions,” ante, at 26,
n. 10 (emphasis added), an assertion that is inconsistent
with the terms of the statute. See §7215(c)(1) (governing
“proceeding[s] by the Board to determine whether a regis
tered public accounting firm, or an associated person
thereof, should be disciplined”).
   Moreover, in addition to their adjudicative functions, the
Accounting Board members supervise, and are themselves,
technical professional experts. See §7211(e)(1) (requiring
that Board members “have a demonstrated” technical
“understanding of the responsibilities” and “obligations of
accountants with respect to the preparation and issuance
of audit reports”). This Court has recognized that the
“difficulties involved in the preparation of” sound auditing
reports require the application of “scientific accounting
principles.” United States v. Anderson, 269 U. S. 422, 440
(1926). And this Court has recognized the constitutional
legitimacy of a justification that rests agency independ
ence upon the need for technical expertise. See Hum
phrey’s Executor, supra, at 624–626; see also Breger &amp;
Edles, Established by Practice: The Theory and Operation
of Independent Federal Agencies, 52 Admin. L. Rev. 1111,
1131–1133 (2000) (explaining how the need for adminis
trators with “technical competence,” “apolitical expertise,”
and skill in “scientific management” led to original crea
tion of independent agencies) (hereinafter Breger &amp; Ed
les); J. Landis, The Administrative Process 23 (1938)
(similar); Woodrow Wilson, Democracy and Efficiency, 87

                      BREYER, J., dissenting

   Here, the justification for insulating the “technical
experts” on the Board from fear of losing their jobs due to
political influence is particularly strong. Congress delib
erately sought to provide that kind of protection. See, e.g.,
148 Cong. Rec. 12036, 12115, 13352–13355. It did so for
good reason. See ante, at 3 (noting that the Accounting
Board was created in response to “a series of celebrated
accounting debacles”); H. R. Rep. No. 107–414, pp. 18–19
(2002) (same); Brief for Former SEC Chairmen 8–9. And
historically, this regulatory subject matter—financial
regulation—has been thought to exhibit a particular need
for independence. See e.g., 51 Cong. Rec. 8857 (1914)
(remarks of Sen. Morgan upon creation of the Federal
Trade Commission) (“[I]t is unsafe for an . . . administra
tive officer representing a great political party . . . to hold
the power of life and death over the great business inter
ests of this country. . . . That is . . . why I believe in . . .
taking these business matters out of politics”). And Con
gress, by, for example, providing the Board with a revenue
stream independent of the congressional appropriations
process, §7219, helped insulate the Board from congres
sional, as well as other, political influences. See, e.g., 148
Cong. Rec. 12036 (statement of Sen. Stabenow).
   In sum, Congress and the President could reasonably
have thought it prudent to insulate the adjudicative Board
members from fear of purely politically based removal. Cf.
Civil Service Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 565
(1973) (“[I]t is not only important that the Government
and its employees in fact avoid practicing political justice,
but it is also critical that they appear to the public to be
avoiding it, if confidence in the system of representative
Government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent”).
And in a world in which we count on the Federal Govern
ment to regulate matters as complex as, say, nuclear
power production, the Court’s assertion that we should
simply learn to get by “without being” regulated “by ex

perts” is, at best, unrealistic—at worst, dangerously so.
Ante, at 18.
                               C
   Where a “for cause” provision is so unlikely to restrict
presidential power and so likely to further a legitimate
institutional need, precedent strongly supports its consti
tutionality. First, in considering a related issue in Nixon
v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425 (1977),
the Court made clear that when “determining whether the
Act disrupts the proper balance between the coordinate
branches, the proper inquiry focuses on the extent to
which it prevents the Executive Branch from accomplish
ing its constitutionally assigned functions.” Id., at 443.
The Court said the same in Morrison, where it upheld a
restriction on the President’s removal power. 487 U. S., at
691 (“[T]he real question is whether the removal restric
tions are of such a nature that they impede the President’s
ability to perform his constitutional duty, and the func
tions of the officials in question must be analyzed in that
light”). Here, the removal restriction may somewhat
diminish the Commission’s ability to control the Board,
but it will have little, if any, negative effect in respect to
the President’s ability to control the Board, let alone to
coordinate the Executive Branch. See Part II–A, supra.
Indeed, given Morrison, where the Court upheld a restric
tion that significantly interfered with the President’s
important historic power to control criminal prosecutions,
a “ ‘purely executive’ ” function, 487 U. S., at 687–689, the
constitutionality of the present restriction would seem to
follow a fortiori.
   Second, as previously pointed out, this Court has re
peatedly upheld “for cause” provisions where they restrict
the President’s power to remove an officer with adjudica
tory responsibilities. Compare Humphrey’s Executor, 295
U. S., at 623–628; Wiener, 357 U. S., at 355; Schor, 478
                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           21

                    BREYER, J., dissenting

U. S., at 854; Morrison, supra, at 691, n. 30, with ante, at
17–18 (ignoring these precedents). And we have also
upheld such restrictions when they relate to officials with
technical responsibilities that warrant a degree of special
independence. E.g., Humphrey’s Executor, supra, at 624.
The Accounting Board’s functions involve both kinds of
responsibility. And, accordingly, the Accounting Board’s
adjudicatory responsibilities, the technical nature of its
job, the need to attract experts to that job, and the impor
tance of demonstrating the nonpolitical nature of the job
to the public strongly justify a statute that assures that
Board members need not fear for their jobs when compe
tently carrying out their tasks, while still maintaining the
Commission as the ultimate authority over Board policies
and actions. See Part II–B, supra.
  Third, consider how several cases fit together in a way
that logically compels a holding of constitutionality here.
In Perkins, 116 U. S., at 483, 484—which was reaffirmed
in Myers, 272 U. S., at 127 and in Morrison, supra, at 689,
n. 27—the Court upheld a removal restriction limiting the
authority of the Secretary of the Navy to remove a “cadet
engineer,” whom the Court explicitly defined as an “infe
rior officer.” The Court said,
       “We have no doubt that when Congress, by law,
    vests the appointment of inferior officers in the heads
    of Departments it may limit and restrict the power of
    removal as it deems best for the public interest. The
    constitutional authority in Congress to thus vest the
    appointment implies authority to limit, restrict, and
    regulate the removal by such laws as Congress may
    enact in relation to the officers so appointed.” Per
    kins, supra, at 485 (emphasis added; internal quota
    tion marks omitted).
See also Morrison, supra, at 723–724 (SCALIA, J., dissent
ing) (agreeing that the power to remove an “inferior offi
22      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

                  BREYER, J., dissenting 


cer” who is appointed by a department head can be re
stricted). Cf. ante, at 30–33 (holding that SEC Commis
sioners are “Heads of Departments”).
   In Humphrey’s Executor, the Court held that Congress
may constitutionally limit the President’s authority to
remove certain principal officers, including heads of de
partments. 295 U. S., at 627–629. And the Court has
consistently recognized the validity of that holding. See
Wiener, supra; United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 706
(1974); Buckley, 424 U. S., at 133–136; Chadha, 462 U. S.,
at 953, n. 16; Bowsher, 478 U. S., at 725–726; Morrison,
supra, at 686–693; Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S.
361, 410–411 (1989).
   And in Freytag, 501 U. S., at 921, JUSTICE SCALIA stated
in a concurring opinion written for four Justices, including
JUSTICE KENNEDY, that “adjusting the remainder of the
Constitution to compensate for Humphrey’s Executor is a
fruitless endeavor.” In these Justices’ view, the Court
should not create a separate constitutional jurisprudence
for the “independent agencies.” That being so, the law
should treat their heads as it treats other Executive
Branch heads of departments. Consequently, as the Court
held in Perkins, Congress may constitutionally “limit and
restrict” the Commission’s power to remove those whom
they appoint (e.g, the Accounting Board members).
   Fourth, the Court has said that “[o]ur separation-of
powers jurisprudence generally focuses on the danger of
one branch’s aggrandizing its power at the expense of
another branch.” Freytag, supra, at 878 (emphasis added);
accord, Buckley, supra, at 129; Schor, supra, at 856; Mor
rison, supra, at 686; cf. Bowsher, supra. Indeed, it has
added that “the essence of the decision in Myers,” which is
the only one of our cases to have struck down a “for cause”
removal restriction, “was the judgment that the Constitu
tion prevents Congress from ‘draw[ing] to itself . . . the
power to remove.’ ” Morrison, supra, at 686 (quoting
                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           23

                    BREYER, J., dissenting

Myers, supra, at 161; emphasis added). Congress here has
“drawn” no power to itself to remove the Board members.
It has instead sought to limit its own power, by, for exam
ple, providing the Accounting Board with a revenue
stream independent of the congressional appropriations
process. See supra, at 19; see also Brief for Former SEC
Chairmen 16. And this case thereby falls outside the
ambit of the Court’s most serious constitutional concern.
   In sum, the Court’s prior cases impose functional
criteria that are readily met here. Once one goes beyond
the Court’s elementary arithmetical logic (i.e., “one plus
one is greater than one”) our precedent virtually dictates
a holding that the challenged “for cause” provision is
constitutional.
                              D
   We should ask one further question. Even if the “for
cause” provision before us does not itself significantly
interfere with the President’s authority or aggrandize
Congress’ power, is it nonetheless necessary to adopt a
bright-line rule forbidding the provision lest, through a
series of such provisions, each itself upheld as reasonable,
Congress might undercut the President’s central constitu
tional role? Cf. Strauss 625–626. The answer to this
question is that no such need has been shown. Moreover,
insofar as the Court seeks to create such a rule, it fails.
And in failing it threatens a harm that is far more serious
than any imaginable harm this “for cause” provision might
bring about.
   The Court fails to create a bright-line rule because of
considerable uncertainty about the scope of its holding—
an uncertainty that the Court’s opinion both reflects and
generates. The Court suggests, for example, that its rule
may not apply where an inferior officer “perform[s] adjudi
cative . . . functions.” Cf. ante, at 26, n. 10. But the Ac
counting Board performs adjudicative functions.          See
24      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY 

              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

                  BREYER, J., dissenting 


supra, at 17–18. What, then, are we to make of the
Court’s potential exception? And would such an exception
apply to an administrative law judge who also has impor
tant administrative duties beyond pure adjudication? See,
e.g., 8 CFR §1003.9, 34 CFR §81.4 (2009). The Court
elsewhere suggests that its rule may be limited to removal
statutes that provide for “judicial review of a[n] effort to
remove” an official for cause. Ante, at 22; ante, at 25. But
we have previously stated that all officers protected by a
for-cause removal provision and later subject to termina
tion are entitled to “notice and [a] hearing” in the “courts,”
as without such review “the appointing power” otherwise
“could remove at pleasure or for such cause as [only] it
deemed sufficient.” Reagan v. United States, 182 U. S.
419, 425 (1901); Shurtleff, 189 U. S., at 314; cf. Hum
phrey’s Executor, supra (entertaining civil suit challenging
removal). But cf. Bowsher, supra, at 729. What weight,
then, should be given to this hint of an exception?
   The Court further seems to suggest that its holding may
not apply to inferior officers who have a different relation
ship to their appointing agents than the relationship
between the Commission and the Board. See ante, at 22,
24–26. But the only characteristic of the “relationship”
between the Commission and the Board that the Court
apparently deems relevant is that the relationship in
cludes two layers of for-cause removal. See, e.g., ante, at
23 (“Broad power over Board functions is not equivalent to
the power to remove Board members”). Why then would
any different relationship that also includes two layers of
for-cause removal survive where this one has not? Cf.
Part II–A, supra (describing the Commission’s near abso
lute control over the Board). In a word, what differences
are relevant? If the Court means to state that its holding
in fact applies only where Congress has “enacted an un
usually high standard” of for-cause removal—and does not
otherwise render two layers of “ ‘ordinary’ ” for-cause re
                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            25

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

moval unconstitutional—I should welcome the statement.
Ante, at 22 (emphasis added); see also ante, at 24–25, 15,
22, (underscoring this statute’s “sharply circumscribed
definition of what constitutes ‘good cause’ ” and its “rigor
ous,” “significant and unusual [removal] protections”).
But much of the majority’s opinion appears to avoid so
narrow a holding in favor of a broad, basically mechanical
rule—a rule that, as I have said, is divorced from the
context of the case at hand. Compare Parts III–A, III–B,
III–C, ante, with Parts II–A, II–B, II–C, supra. And such
a mechanical rule cannot be cabined simply by saying
that, perhaps, the rule does not apply to instances that, at
least at first blush, seem highly similar. A judicial holding
by its very nature is not “a restricted railroad ticket, good
for” one “day and train only.” Smith v. Allwright, 321
U. S. 649, 669 (1944) (Roberts, J., dissenting).
   The Court begins to reveal the practical problems inher
ent in its double for-cause rule when it suggests that its
rule may not apply to “the civil service.” Ante, at 26. The
“civil service” is defined by statute to include “all appoint
ive positions in . . . the Government of the United States,”
excluding the military, but including all civil “officer[s]” up
to and including those who are subject to Senate confirma
tion. 5 U. S. C. §§2101, 2102(a)(1)(B), 2104. The civil
service thus includes many officers indistinguishable from
the members of both the Commission and the Accounting
Board. Indeed, as this Court recognized in Myers, the
“competitive service”—the class within the broader civil
service that enjoys the most robust career protection—
“includes a vast majority of all the civil officers” in the
United States. 272 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added); 5
U. S. C. §2102(c).
   But even if I assume that the majority categorically
excludes the competitive service from the scope of its new
rule, cf. ante, at 26 (leaving this question open), the exclu
sion would be insufficient. This is because the Court’s
26      FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY
              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD.
                  BREYER, J., dissenting

“double for-cause” rule applies to appointees who are
“inferior officer[s].” Ante, at 2. And who are they? Courts
and scholars have struggled for more than a century to
define the constitutional term “inferior officers,” without
much success. See 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Con
stitution §1536, pp. 397–398 (3d ed. 1858) (“[T]here does
not seem to have been any exact line drawn, who are and
who are not to be deemed inferior officers, in the sense of
the constitution”); Edmond v. United States, 520 U. S. 651,
661 (1997) (“Our cases have not set forth an exclusive
criterion for [defining] inferior officers”); Memorandum
from Steven G. Bradbury, Acting Assistant Attorney
General, Office of Legal Counsel, to the General Counsels
of the Executive Branch: Officers of the United States
Within the Meaning of the Appointments Clause, p. 3
(Apr. 16, 2007) (hereinafter OLC Memo), online at
http://www.justice.gov/olc/2007/appointmentsclausev10.pdf
(“[T]he Supreme Court has not articulated the precise
scope and application of the [Inferior Officer] Clause’s
requirements”); Konecke, The Appointments Clause and
Military Judges: Inferior Appointment to a Principal
Office, 5 Seton Hall Const. L. J. 489, 492 (1995) (same);
Burkoff, Appointment and Removal Under the Federal
Constitution: The Impact of Buckley v. Valeo, 22 Wayne
L. Rev. 1335, 1347, 1364 (1976) (describing our early
precedent as “circular” and our later law as “not particu
larly useful”). The Court does not clarify the concept. But
without defining who is an inferior officer, to whom the
majority’s new rule applies, we cannot know the scope or
the coherence of the legal rule that the Court creates. I
understand the virtues of a common-law case-by-case
approach. But here that kind of approach (when applied
without more specificity than I can find in the Court’s
opinion) threatens serious harm.
   The problem is not simply that the term “inferior officer”
is indefinite but also that efforts to define it inevitably
                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            27

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

conclude that the term’s sweep is unusually broad. Con
sider the Court’s definitions: Inferior officers are, inter
alia, (1) those charged with “the administration and en
forcement of the public law,” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 139;
ante, at 2; (2) those granted “significant authority,” 424
U. S., at 126; ante, at 25; (3) those with “responsibility for
conducting civil litigation in the courts of the United
States,” 424 U. S., at 140; and (4) those “who can be said to
hold an office,” United States v. Germaine, 99 U. S. 508,
510 (1879), that has been created either by “regulations”
or by “statute,” United States v. Mouat, 124 U. S. 303,
307–308 (1888).
   Consider the definitional conclusion that the Depart
ment of Justice more recently reached: An “inferior officer”
is anyone who holds a “continuing” position and who is
“invested by legal authority with a portion of the sovereign
powers of the federal Government,” including, inter alia,
the power to “arrest criminals,” “seize persons or property,”
“issue regulations,” “issue . . . authoritative legal opin
ions,” “conduc[t] civil litigation,” “collec[t] revenue,” repre
sent “the United States to foreign nations,” “command”
military force, or enter into “contracts” on behalf “of the
nation.” OLC Memo 1, 4, 12–13, 15–16 (internal quotation
marks omitted; emphasis added).
   And consider the fact that those whom this Court has
held to be “officers” include: (1) a district court clerk,
Hennen, 13 Pet., at 258; (2) “thousands of clerks in the
Departments of the Treasury, Interior and the othe[r]”
departments, Germaine, supra, at 511, who are responsi
ble for “the records, books, and papers appertaining to the
office,” Hennen, supra, at 259; (3) a clerk to “the assistant
treasurer” stationed “at Boston,” United States v. Hart

parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371, 397–399 (1880); (7) United
States attorneys, Myers, supra, at 159; (8) federal mar
shals, Sieblod, supra, at 397; Morrison, 487 U. S., at 676;
(9) military judges, Weiss v. United States, 510 U. S., 163,
170 (1994); (10) judges in Article I courts, Freytag, 501
U. S., at 880–881; and (11) the general counsel of the
Department of Transportation, Edmond v. United States,
520 U. S. 651 (1997). Individual Members of the Court
would add to the list the Federal Communication Commis
sion’s managing director, the Federal Trade Commission’s
“secretary,” the general counsel of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, and more generally, bureau chiefs,
general counsels, and administrative law judges, see
Freytag, supra, at 918–920 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment), as well as “ordinary commis
sioned military officers,” Weiss, supra, at 182 (Souter, J.,
concurring).
   Reading the criteria above as stringently as possible, I
still see no way to avoid sweeping hundreds, perhaps
thousands of high level government officials within the
scope of the Court’s holding, putting their job security and
their administrative actions and decisions constitutionally
at risk. To make even a conservative estimate, one would
have to begin by listing federal departments, offices, bu
reaus and other agencies whose heads are by statute
removable only “for cause.” I have found 48 such agencies,
which I have listed in Appendix A, infra. Then it would be
necessary to identify the senior officials in those agencies
(just below the top) who themselves are removable only
“for cause.” I have identified 573 such high-ranking offi
cials, whom I have listed in Appendix B, infra. They
include most of the leadership of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (including that agency’s executive director as
well as the directors of its Office of Nuclear Reactor Regu
lation and Office of Enforcement), virtually all of the
leadership of the Social Security Administration, the
                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           29

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

executive directors of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, as well
as the general counsels of the Chemical Safety Board, the
Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, and
the National Mediation Board.
   This list is a conservative estimate because it consists
only of career appointees in the Senior Executive Service
(SES), see 5 U. S. C. §§2101a, 3132(a)(2), a group of high
ranking officials distinct from the “competitive service,” see
§2101(a)(1)(C), who “serve in the key positions just below
the top Presidential appointees,” Office of Personnel Man
agement, About the Senior Executive Service, online at
http://www.opm.gov/ses/about_ses/index.asp; §2102(a)(1)(C),
and who are, without exception, subject to “removal” only for
cause. §§7542–7543; see also §2302(a)(2) (substantially
limiting conditions under which “a career appointee in the
Senior Executive Service” may be “transfer[red], or reas
sign[ed]”). SES officials include, for example, the Director
of the Bureau of Prisons, the Director of the National Drug
Intelligence Center, and the Director of the Office of In
ternational Monetary Policy in the Treasury Department.
See Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Gov
ernment Affairs, United States Government Policy and
Supporting Positions (2008), pp. 99, 103, 129 (hereinafter
Plum Book). And by virtually any definition, essentially
all SES officials qualify as “inferior officers,” for their
duties, as defined by statute, require them to “direc[t] the
work of an organizational unit,” carry out high-level
managerial functions, or “otherwise exercis[e] important
policy-making, policy-determining, or other executive func
tions.” §3132(a)(2) (emphasis added). Cf. ante, at 2 (de
scribing an “inferior officer” as someone who “determines
the policy and enforces the laws of the United States”);
ante, at 26 (acknowledging that career SES appointees in
independent agencies may be rendered unconstitutional in
future cases). Is the SES exempt from today’s rule or is it

              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

                  BREYER, J., dissenting 


not? The Court, after listing reasons why the SES may be
different, simply says that it will not “addres[s]” the mat
ter. Ante, at 27. Perhaps it does not do so because it cannot
do so without revealing the difficulty of distinguishing the
SES from the Accounting Board and thereby also revealing
the inherent instability of the legal rule it creates.
   The potential list of those whom today’s decision affects
is yet larger. As JUSTICE SCALIA has observed, adminis
trative law judges (ALJs) “are all executive officers.”
Freytag, 501 U. S., at 910 (opinion concurring in part and
concurring in judgment) (emphasis deleted); see also, e.g.,
id., at 881 (majority opinion) (“[A] [tax-court] special trial
judge is an ‘inferior Officer’ ”); Edmond, supra, at 654
(“[M]ilitary trial and appellate judges are [inferior] offi
cers”). But cf. ante, at 26, n. 10. And ALJs are each re
movable “only for good cause established and determined
by the Merit Systems Protection Board,” 5 U. S. C.
§§7521(a)–(b). But the members of the Merit Systems
Protection Board are themselves protected from removal
by the President absent good cause. §1202(d).
   My research reflects that the Federal Government relies
on 1,584 ALJs to adjudicate administrative matters in
over 25 agencies. See Appendix C, infra; see also Memo
randum of Juanita Love, Office of Personnel Manage
ment, to Supreme Court Library (May 28, 2010) (avail
able in Clerk of Court’s case file). These ALJs adjudicate
Social Security benefits, employment disputes, and other
matters highly important to individuals. Does every
losing party before an ALJ now have grounds to appeal on
the basis that the decision entered against him is uncon
stitutional? Cf. ante, at 26, n. 10 (“[O]ur holding also does
not address” this question).
   And what about the military? Commissioned military
officers “are ‘inferior officers.’ ” Weiss, 510 U. S., at 182
(Souter, J., concurring); id., at 169–170 (majority opinion).
There are over 210,000 active-duty commissioned officers
                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           31

currently serving in the armed forces. See Dept. of Defense,
Active Duty Military Personnel by Rank (Apr. 30, 2010),
online at http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/MILITARY/
rg1004.pdf. Numerous statutory provisions provide that
such officers may not be removed from office except for
cause (at least in peacetime). See, e.g., 10 U. S. C. §§629–
632, 804, 1161, 1181–1185. And such officers can gener
ally be so removed only by other commissioned officers, see
§§612, 825, 1187, who themselves enjoy the same career
protections.
  The majority might simply say that the military is
different. But it will have to explain how it is different. It
is difficult to see why the Constitution would provide a
President who is the military’s “commander-in-chief,”
Art. II, §2, cl. 1, with less authority to remove “inferior”
military “officers” than to remove comparable civil offi
cials. See Barron &amp; Lederman, The Commander in Chief
at the Lowest Ebb—A Constitutional History, 121 Harv.
L. Rev. 941, 1102–1106 (2008) (describing President’s
“superintendence prerogative” over the military). Cf. ante,
at 26–27 (not “expressing any view whatever” as to
whether military officers’ authority is now unconstitutional).
  The majority sees “no reason . . . to address whether”
any of “these positions,” “or any others,” might be deemed
unconstitutional under its new rule, preferring instead to
leave these matters for a future case. Ante, at 27. But
what is to happen in the meantime? Is the work of all
these various officials to be put on hold while the courts of
appeals determine whether today’s ruling applies to them?
Will Congress have to act to remove the “for cause” provi
sions? Cf. Buckley, 424 U. S., at 142–143. Can the Presi
dent then restore them via executive order? And, still,
what about the military? A clearer line would help avoid
these practical difficulties.
  The majority asserts that its opinion will not affect the
Government’s ability to function while these many ques

              ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. 

                  BREYER, J., dissenting 


tions are litigated in the lower courts because the Court’s
holding concerns only “the conditions under which th[e]se
officers might some day be removed.” Ante, at 27. But
this case was not brought by federal officials challenging
their potential removal. It was brought by private indi
viduals who were subject to regulation “ ‘here-and-now’ ”
and who “object to the” very “existence” of the regulators
themselves. Ante, at 33, 8 (emphasis added). And those
private individuals have prevailed. Thus, any person
similarly regulated by a federal official who is potentially
subject to the Court’s amorphous new rule will be able to
bring an “implied private right of action directly under the
Constitution” “seeking . . . a declaratory judgment that”
the official’s actions are “unconstitutional and an injunc
tion preventing the” official “from exercising [his] powers.”
Ante, at 10, n. 2, 6; cf., e.g., Legal Services Corporation v.
Velazquez, 531 U. S. 533, 546 (2001) (affirming grant of
preliminary injunction to cure, inter alia, a separation-of
powers violation); Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co., 343 U. S.
579 (same). Such a plaintiff need not even first exhaust
his administrative remedies. Ante, at 7–10.
   Nor is it clear that courts will always be able to cure
such a constitutional defect merely by severing an offend
ing removal provision. For a court’s “ability to devise
[such] a judicial remedy . . . often depends on how clearly”
the “background constitutional rules at issue” have been
“articulated”; severance will be unavailable “in a murky
constitutional context,” which is precisely the context that
the Court’s new rule creates. Ayotte v. Planned Parent
hood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 329, 330 (2006).
Moreover, “the touchstone” of the severability analysis “is
legislative intent,” id., at 330, and Congress has repeat
edly expressed its judgment “over the last century that it
is in the best interest of the country, indeed essential, that
federal service should depend upon meritorious perform
ance rather than political service,” Civil Service Comm’n,

413 U. S., at 557; see also Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367,
380–388 (1983) (describing the history of “Congressional
attention to the problem of politically-motivated removals”).
And so it may well be that courts called upon to resolve the
many questions the majority’s opinion raises will not only
apply the Court’s new rule to its logical conclusion, but will
also determine that the only available remedy to certain
double for-cause problems is to invalidate entire agencies.
   Thus, notwithstanding the majority’s assertions to the
contrary, the potential consequences of today’s holding are
worrying. The upshot, I believe, is a legal dilemma. To
interpret the Court’s decision as applicable only in a few
circumstances will make the rule less harmful but arbi-
trary. To interpret the rule more broadly will make the
rule more rational, but destructive.
                                III
  One last question: How can the Court simply assume
without deciding that the SEC Commissioners themselves
are removable only “for cause”? See ante, at 5 (“[W]e
decide the case with th[e] understanding” “that the Com-
missioners cannot themselves be removed by the Presi-
dent except” for cause (emphasis added)). Unless the
Commissioners themselves are in fact protected by a “for
cause” requirement, the Accounting Board statute, on the
Court’s own reasoning, is not constitutionally defective. I
am not aware of any other instance in which the Court has
similarly (on its own or through stipulation) created a
constitutional defect in a statute and then relied on that
defect to strike a statute down as unconstitutional. Cf.
Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)
(opinion for the Court by SCALIA, J.) (slip op., at 20) (“We
do not—we cannot—add provisions to a federal statute . . .
especially [if] . . . separation-of-powers concerns . . . would
[thereby] arise”); The Anaconda v. American Sugar Refin-
ing Co., 322 U. S. 42, 46 (1944) (describing parties’ inabil-

ity to “stipulate away” what “the legislation declares”).
   It is certainly not obvious that the SEC Commissioners
enjoy “for cause” protection. Unlike the statutes establish-
ing the 48 federal agencies listed in Appendix A, infra, the
statute that established the Commission says nothing
about removal. It is silent on the question. As far as its
text is concerned, the President’s authority to remove the
Commissioners is no different from his authority to re-
move the Secretary of State or the Attorney General. See
Shurtleff, 189 U. S., at 315 (“To take away th[e] power of
removal . . . would require very clear and explicit lan-
guage. It should not be held to be taken away by mere
inference or implication”); see also Memorandum from
David J. Barron, Acting Assistant Attorney General,
Office of Legal Counsel, to the Principal Deputy Counsel
to the President: Removability of the Federal Coordinator
for Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects, p. 2 (Oct.
23, 2009), online at http://justice.gov/olc/2009/gas-transport-
project.pdf (“[Where] Congress did not explicitly provide
tenure protection . . . the President, consistent with . . .
settled principles, may remove . . . without cause”); The
Constitutional Separation of Powers Between the Presi-
dent and Congress, 20 Op. Legal Counsel 124, 170 (1996)
(same).
   Nor is the absence of a “for cause” provision in the stat-
ute that created the Commission likely to have been inad-
vertent. Congress created the Commission during the 9-
year period after this Court decided Myers, and thereby
cast serious doubt on the constitutionality of all “for cause”
removal provisions, but before it decided Humphrey’s
Executor, which removed any doubt in respect to the con-
stitutionality of making commissioners of independent
agencies removable only for cause. In other words, Con-
gress created the SEC at a time when, under this Court’s
precedents, it would have been unconstitutional to make
the Commissioners removable only for cause. And, during
                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            35

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

that 9-year period, Congress created at least three major
federal agencies without making any of their officers
removable for cause. See 48 Stat. 885, 15 U. S. C. §78d
(Securities and Exchange Commission), 48 Stat. 1066, 47
U. S. C. §154 (Federal Communications Commission); 46
Stat. 797 (Federal Power Commission) (reformed post-
Humphrey’s Executor as the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission with “for cause” protection, 91 Stat. 582, 42
U. S. C. §7171). By way of contrast, only one month after
Humphrey’s Executor was decided, Congress returned to
its pre-Myers practice of including such provisions in
statutes creating independent commissions. See §3, 49
Stat. 451, 29 U. S. C. §153 (establishing National Labor
Relations Board with an explicit removal limitation).
   The fact that Congress did not make the SEC Commis
sioners removable “for cause” does not mean it intended to
create a dependent, rather than an independent agency.
Agency independence is a function of several different
factors, of which “for cause” protection is only one. Those
factors include, inter alia, an agency’s separate (rather
than presidentially dependent) budgeting authority, its
separate litigating authority, its composition as a multi
member bipartisan board, the use of the word “independ
ent” in its authorizing statute, and, above all, a political
environment, reflecting tradition and function, that would
impose a heavy political cost upon any President who tried
to remove a commissioner of the agency without cause.
See generally Breger &amp; Edles 1135–1155.
   The absence of a “for cause” provision is thus not fatal to
agency independence. Indeed, a “Congressional Research
Service official suggests that there are at least 13 ‘inde
pendent’ agencies without a removal provision in their
statutes.” Id., at 1143, n. 161 (emphasis added) (citing
congressional testimony). But it does draw the majority’s
rule into further confusion. For not only are we left with
out a definition of an “inferior officer,” but we are also left

to guess which department heads will be deemed by the
majority to be subject to for-cause removal notwithstand
ing statutes containing no such provision. If any agency
deemed “independent” will be similarly treated, the scope
of the majority’s holding is even broader still. See Appen
dix D, infra (listing agencies potentially affected).
   The Court then, by assumption, reads into the statute
books a “for cause removal” phrase that does not appear in
the relevant statute and which Congress probably did not
intend to write. And it does so in order to strike down, not
to uphold, another statute. This is not a statutory con
struction that seeks to avoid a constitutional question, but
its opposite. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347
(1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (“It is not the habit of the
Court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless
absolutely necessary to a decision of the case” (internal
quotation marks omitted)); NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of
Chicago, 440 U. S. 490, 500 (1979) (“[A]n Act of Congress
ought not to be construed to violate the Constitution if any
other possible construction remains available”).
   I do not need to decide whether the Commissioners are
in fact removable only “for cause” because I would uphold
the Accounting Board’s removal provision as constitu
tional regardless. But were that not so, a determination
that the silent SEC statute means no more than it says
would properly avoid the determination of unconstitution
ality that the Court now makes.
                        *     *     *
  In my view the Court’s decision is wrong—very wrong.
As Parts II–A, II–B, and II–C of this opinion make clear, if
the Court were to look to the proper functional and contex
tual considerations, it would find the Accounting Board
provision constitutional. As Part II–D shows, insofar as
the Court instead tries to create a bright-line rule, it fails
to do so. Its rule of decision is both imprecise and overly
                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          37

                    BREYER, J., dissenting

broad. In light of the present imprecision, it must either
narrow its rule arbitrarily, leaving it to apply virtually
alone to the Accounting Board, or it will have to leave in
place a broader rule of decision applicable to many other
“inferior officers” as well. In doing the latter, it will un
dermine the President’s authority. And it will create an
obstacle, indeed pose a serious threat, to the proper func
tioning of that workable Government that the Constitu
tion seeks to create—in provisions this Court is sworn to
uphold.
   With respect I dissent.

  There are 24 stand-alone federal agencies (i.e., “depart
ments”) whose heads are, by statute, removable by the
President only “for cause.” Moreover, there are at least 24
additional offices, boards, or bureaus situated within
departments that are similarly subject, by statute, to for
cause removal provisions. The chart below first lists the
24 departments and then lists the 24 additional offices,
boards, and bureaus. I have highlighted those instances
in which a “for-cause” office is situated within a “for
cause” department—i.e., instances of “double for-cause”
removal that are essentially indistinguishable from this
case (with the notable exception that the Accounting
Board may not be statutorily subject to two layers of for
cause removal, cf. Part III, supra). This list does not
include instances of “double for-cause” removal that arise
in Article I courts, although such instances might also be
affected by the majority’s holding, cf. ante, at 26, n. 10.

                               B
   The table that follows lists the 573 career appointees in
the Senior Executive Service (SES) who constitute the
upper level management of the independent agencies
listed in Appendix A, supra. Each of these officials is,
under any definition—including the Court’s—an inferior
officer, and is, by statute, subject to two layers of for-cause
removal. See supra, at 25–30.
   The data are organized into three columns: The first
column lists the “office” to which the corresponding official
is assigned within the respective agency and, where avail
able, the provision of law establishing that office. Cf.
supra, at 27 (citing Mouat, 124 U. S., at 307–308; Ger
maine, 99 U. S., at 510). The second and third columns
respectively list the career appointees in each agency who
occupy “general” and “reserved” SES positions. A “gen
eral” position is one that could be filled by either a career
appointee or by a noncareer appointee were the current
(career) occupant to be replaced.           See 5       U. S. C.
§3132(b)(1). Because 90% of all SES positions must be
filled by career appointees, §3134(b), “most General posi
tions are filled by career appointees,” Plum Book 200. A
“reserved” position, by contrast, must always be filled by a
career appointee. §3132(b)(1). The data for the “general
position” column come from the 2008 Plum Book, a quad
rennial manual prepared by the congressional committees
responsible for government oversight. See supra, at 29.
Positions listed as vacant in that source are not included.
The data for the “reserved position” column come from a
list periodically published by the Office of Personnel Man
agement and last published in 2006. See 72 Fed. Reg.
16154–16251 (2007); §3132(b)(4). Given the Federal Gov
ernment’s size and the temporal lag between the underly
ing sources, the list that follows is intended to be illustra
tive, not exact.

   According to data provided by the Office of Personnel
Management, reprinted below, there are 1,584 adminis
trative law judges (ALJs) in the Federal Government.
Each of these ALJs is an inferior officer and each is sub
ject, by statute, to two layers of for-cause removal. See
supra, at 30. The table below lists the 28 federal agencies
that rely on ALJs to adjudicate individual administrative
cases. The source is available in the Clerk of Court’s case
file. See ibid.

  The table below lists 29 departments and other agencies
the heads of which are not subject to any statutory for
cause removal provision, but that do bear certain other
indicia of independence.
  The table identifies six criteria that may suggest inde
pendence: (1) whether the agency consists of a multi
member commission; (2) whether its members are re
quired, by statute, to be bipartisan (or nonpartisan); (3)
whether eligibility to serve as the agency’s head depends
on statutorily defined qualifications; (4) whether the
agency has independence in submitting budgetary and
other proposals to Congress (thereby bypassing the Office
of Management and Budget); (5) whether the agency has
authority to appear in court independent of the Depart
ment of Justice, cf. 28 U. S. C. §§516–519; and (6) whether
the agency is explicitly classified as “independent” by
statute. See generally Breger &amp; Edles 1135–1155; supra,
at 35–36. Unless otherwise noted, all information refers
to the relevant agency’s organic statute, which is cited in
the first column. The list of agencies is nonexhaustive.

he constitu
tionally enumerated rights protected by the Privileges or Immunities
Clause should consist of all the rights recognized in the Bill of Rights
and no others. Constitutional provisions outside the Bill of Rights
protect individual rights, see, e.g., Art. I, §9, cl. 2 (granting the “Privi
lege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus”), and there is no obvious evidence
that the Framers of the Privileges or Immunities Clause meant to
exclude them. In addition, certain Bill of Rights provisions prevent
federal interference in state affairs and are not readily construed as
protecting rights that belong to individuals. The Ninth and Tenth
Amendments are obvious examples, as is the First Amendment’s
Establishment Clause, which “does not purport to protect individual
rights.” Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 50
(2004) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment); see Amar 179–180.

privilege or immunity of American citizenship, but one
governed by the States alone. The Court held that the
Privileges or Immunities Clause protected only rights of
federal citizenship—those “which owe their existence to
the Federal government, its National character, its Con
stitution, or its laws,” id., at 79—and did not protect any
of the rights of state citizenship, id., at 74. In other
words, the Court defined the two sets of rights as mutually
exclusive.
   After separating these two sets of rights, the Court
defined the rights of state citizenship as “embrac[ing]
nearly every civil right for the establishment and protec
tion of which organized government is instituted”—that is,
all those rights listed in Corfield. 16 Wall., at 76 (refer
ring to “those rights” that “Judge Washington” described).
That left very few rights of federal citizenship for the
Privileges or Immunities Clause to protect. The Court
suggested a handful of possibilities, such as the “right of
free access to [federal] seaports,” protection of the Federal
Government while traveling “on the high seas,” and even
two rights listed in the Constitution. Id., at 79 (noting
“[t]he right to peaceably assemble” and “the privilege of
the writ of habeas corpus”); see supra, at 4. But its deci
sion to interpret the rights of state and federal citizenship
as mutually exclusive led the Court in future cases to
conclude that constitutionally enumerated rights were
excluded from the Privileges or Immunities Clause’s scope.
See Cruikshank, supra.
   I reject that understanding. There was no reason to
interpret the Privileges or Immunities Clause as putting
the Court to the extreme choice of interpreting the “privi
leges and immunities” of federal citizenship to mean ei
ther all those rights listed in Corfield, or almost no rights
at all. 16 Wall., at 76. The record is scant that the public
understood the Clause to make the Federal Government
“a perpetual censor upon all legislation of the States” as
50                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.

the Slaughter-House majority feared. Id., at 78. For one
thing, Corfield listed the “elective franchise” as one of the
privileges and immunities of “citizens of the several
states,” 6 F. Cas., at 552, yet Congress and the States still
found it necessary to adopt the Fifteenth Amendment—
which protects “[t]he right of citizens of the United States
to vote”—two years after the Fourteenth Amendment’s
passage. If the Privileges or Immunities Clause were
understood to protect every conceivable civil right from
state abridgment, the Fifteenth Amendment would have
been redundant.
   The better view, in light of the States and Federal Gov
ernment’s shared history of recognizing certain inalienable
rights in their citizens, is that the privileges and immuni
ties of state and federal citizenship overlap. This is not to
say that the privileges and immunities of state and federal
citizenship are the same. At the time of the Fourteenth
Amendment’s ratification, States performed many more
functions than the Federal Government, and it is unlikely
that, simply by referring to “privileges or immunities,” the
Framers of §1 meant to transfer every right mentioned in
Corfield to congressional oversight. As discussed, “privi
leges” and “immunities” were understood only as syno
nyms for “rights.” See supra, at 9–11. It was their at
tachment to a particular group that gave them content,
and the text and history recounted here indicate that the
rights of United States citizens were not perfectly identi
cal to the rights of citizens “in the several States.” Justice
Swayne, one of the dissenters in Slaughter-House, made
the point clear:
     “The citizen of a State has the same fundamental
     rights as a citizen of the United States, and also cer
     tain others, local in their character, arising from his
     relation to the State, and in addition, those which be
     long to the citizen of the United States, he being in
                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   51

                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.

     that relation also. There may thus be a double citi
     zenship, each having some rights peculiar to itself. It
     is only over those which belong to the citizen of the
     United States that the category here in question
     throws the shield of its protection.” 16 Wall., at 126
     (emphasis added).
Because the privileges and immunities of American citi
zenship include rights enumerated in the Constitution,
they overlap to at least some extent with the privileges
and immunities traditionally recognized in citizens in the
several States.
  A separate question is whether the privileges and im
munities of American citizenship include any rights be
sides those enumerated in the Constitution. The four
dissenting Justices in Slaughter-House would have held
that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected the
unenumerated right that the butchers in that case as
serted. See id., at 83 (Field, J., dissenting); id., at 111
(Bradley, J., dissenting); id., at 124 (Swayne, J., dissent
ing). Because this case does not involve an unenumerated
right, it is not necessary to resolve the question whether
the Clause protects such rights, or whether the Court’s
judgment in Slaughter-House was correct.
  Still, it is argued that the mere possibility that the
Privileges or Immunities Clause may enforce unenumer
ated rights against the States creates “ ‘special hazards’ ”
that should prevent this Court from returning to the
original meaning of the Clause.21 Post, at 3 (STEVENS, J.,
dissenting). Ironically, the same objection applies to the

Court’s substantive due process jurisprudence, which
illustrates the risks of granting judges broad discretion to
recognize individual constitutional rights in the absence of
textual or historical guideposts. But I see no reason to
assume that such hazards apply to the Privileges or Im
munities Clause. The mere fact that the Clause does not
expressly list the rights it protects does not render it
incapable of principled judicial application. The Constitu
tion contains many provisions that require an examination
of more than just constitutional text to determine whether
a particular act is within Congress’ power or is otherwise
prohibited. See, e.g., Art. I, §8, cl. 18 (Necessary and
Proper Clause); Amdt. 8 (Cruel and Unusual Punishments
Clause). When the inquiry focuses on what the ratifying
era understood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to
mean, interpreting it should be no more “hazardous” than
interpreting these other constitutional provisions by using
the same approach. To be sure, interpreting the Privileges
or Immunities Clause may produce hard questions. But
they will have the advantage of being questions the Con
stitution asks us to answer. I believe those questions are
more worthy of this Court’s attention—and far more likely
to yield discernable answers—than the substantive due
process questions the Court has for years created on its
own, with neither textual nor historical support.
   Finding these impediments to returning to the original
meaning overstated, I reject Slaughter-House insofar as it
precludes any overlap between the privileges and immuni
ties of state and federal citizenship. I next proceed to the
stare decisis considerations surrounding the precedent
that expressly controls the question presented here.
                            B
  Three years after Slaughter-House, the Court in Cruik
shank squarely held that the right to keep and bear arms
was not a privilege of American citizenship, thereby over

turning the convictions of militia members responsible for
the brutal Colfax Massacre. See supra, at 4–5. Cruik
shank is not a precedent entitled to any respect. The flaws
in its interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities
Clause are made evident by the preceding evidence of its
original meaning, and I would reject the holding on that
basis alone. But, the consequences of Cruikshank warrant
mention as well.
   Cruikshank’s holding that blacks could look only to state
governments for protection of their right to keep and bear
arms enabled private forces, often with the assistance of
local governments, to subjugate the newly freed slaves and
their descendants through a wave of private violence
designed to drive blacks from the voting booth and force
them into peonage, an effective return to slavery. Without
federal enforcement of the inalienable right to keep and
bear arms, these militias and mobs were tragically suc
cessful in waging a campaign of terror against the very
people the Fourteenth Amendment had just made citizens.
   Take, for example, the Hamburg Massacre of 1876.
There, a white citizen militia sought out and murdered a
troop of black militiamen for no other reason than that
they had dared to conduct a celebratory Fourth of July
parade through their mostly black town. The white mili
tia commander, “Pitchfork” Ben Tillman, later described
this massacre with pride: “[T]he leading white men of
Edgefield” had decided “to seize the first opportunity that
the negroes might offer them to provoke a riot and teach
the negroes a lesson by having the whites demonstrate
their superiority by killing as many of them as was justifi
able.” S. Kantrowitz, Ben Tillman &amp; the Reconstruction of
White Supremacy 67 (2000) (ellipsis, brackets, and inter
nal quotation marks omitted). None of the perpetrators of
the Hamburg murders was ever brought to justice.22
——————
 22 Tillman   went on to a long career as South Carolina’s Governor and,
54                      MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                          Opinion of THOMAS, J.

   Organized terrorism like that perpetuated by Tillman
and his cohorts proliferated in the absence of federal
enforcement of constitutional rights. Militias such as the
Ku Klux Klan, the Knights of the White Camellia, the
White Brotherhood, the Pale Faces, and the ’76 Associa
tion spread terror among blacks and white Republicans by
breaking up Republican meetings, threatening political
leaders, and whipping black militiamen. Era of Recon
struction, 199–200; Curtis 156. These groups raped,
murdered, lynched, and robbed as a means of intimidat
ing, and instilling pervasive fear in, those whom they
despised. A. Trelease, White Terror: The Ku Klux Klan
Conspiracy and Southern Reconstruction 28–46 (1995).
   Although Congress enacted legislation to suppress these
activities,23 Klan tactics remained a constant presence in
the lives of Southern blacks for decades. Between 1882
and 1968, there were at least 3,446 reported lynchings of
blacks in the South. Cottrol 351–352. They were tortured
and killed for a wide array of alleged crimes, without even
the slightest hint of due process. Emmit Till, for example,
was killed in 1955 for allegedly whistling at a white
woman. S. Whitfield, A Death in the Delta: The Story of
Emmett Till 15–31 (1988). The fates of other targets of
mob violence were equally depraved. See, e.g., Lynched
Negro and Wife Were First Mutilated, Vicksburg (Miss.)

finance law have been discussed in our recent cases on that subject.

length the Tillman Act of 1907, 34 Stat. 864). His contributions to the
culture of terrorism that grew in the wake of Cruikshank had an even
more dramatic and tragic effect.
   23 In an effort to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment and halt this

violence, Congress enacted a series of civil rights statutes, including the
Force Acts, see Act of May 31, 1870, 16 Stat. 140; Act of Feb. 28, 1871,

13, 1914, in id., at 93 (reporting incident in Louisiana).
  The use of firearms for self-defense was often the only
way black citizens could protect themselves from mob
violence. As Eli Cooper, one target of such violence, is said
to have explained, “ ‘[t]he Negro has been run over for fifty
years, but it must stop now, and pistols and shotguns are
the only weapons to stop a mob.’ ” Church Burnings Fol
low Negro Agitator’s Lynching, Chicago Defender, Sept. 6,
1919, in id., at 124. Sometimes, as in Cooper’s case, self
defense did not succeed. He was dragged from his home
by a mob and killed as his wife looked on. Ibid. But at
other times, the use of firearms allowed targets of mob
violence to survive. One man recalled the night during his
childhood when his father stood armed at a jail until
morning to ward off lynchers. See Cottrol, 354. The ex
perience left him with a sense, “not ‘of powerlessness, but
of the “possibilities of salvation” ’ ” that came from stand
ing up to intimidation. Ibid.
  In my view, the record makes plain that the Framers of
the Privileges or Immunities Clause and the ratifying-era
public understood—just as the Framers of the Second
Amendment did—that the right to keep and bear arms
was essential to the preservation of liberty. The record
makes equally plain that they deemed this right necessary
to include in the minimum baseline of federal rights that
the Privileges or Immunities Clause established in the
wake of the War over slavery. There is nothing about
Cruikshank’s contrary holding that warrants its retention.

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

                            [June 28, 2010] 


   JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.
   In District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, ___
(2008) (slip op., at 1), the Court answered the question
whether a federal enclave’s “prohibition on the possession
of usable handguns in the home violates the Second
Amendment to the Constitution.” The question we should
be answering in this case is whether the Constitution
“guarantees individuals a fundamental right,” enforceable
against the States, “to possess a functional, personal
firearm, including a handgun, within the home.” Com­
plaint ¶34, App. 23. That is a different—and more diffi­
cult—inquiry than asking if the Fourteenth Amendment
“incorporates” the Second Amendment. The so-called
incorporation question was squarely and, in my view,
correctly resolved in the late 19th century.1
   Before the District Court, petitioners focused their
pleadings on the special considerations raised by domestic
possession, which they identified as the core of their as­
serted right. In support of their claim that the city of
Chicago’s handgun ban violates the Constitution, they now
rely primarily on the Privileges or Immunities Clause of

decisions.

the Fourteenth Amendment. See Brief for Petitioners 9–
65. They rely secondarily on the Due Process Clause of
that Amendment. See id., at 66–72. Neither submission
requires the Court to express an opinion on whether the
Fourteenth Amendment places any limit on the power of
States to regulate possession, use, or carriage of firearms
outside the home.
   I agree with the plurality’s refusal to accept petitioners’
primary submission. Ante, at 10. Their briefs marshal an
impressive amount of historical evidence for their argu­
ment that the Court interpreted the Privileges or Immuni­
ties Clause too narrowly in the Slaughter-House Cases, <span class="citation">

original meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause, “[l]egal

burden is severe for those who seek radical change in such
an established body of constitutional doctrine.3 Moreover,
the suggestion that invigorating the Privileges or Immuni­
ties Clause will reduce judicial discretion, see Reply Brief
for Petitioners 22, n. 8, 26; Tr. of Oral Arg. 64–65, strikes
me as implausible, if not exactly backwards. “For the very
reason that it has so long remained a clean slate, a revital­
ized Privileges or Immunities Clause holds special hazards
for judges who are mindful that their proper task is not to
write their personal views of appropriate public policy into
the Constitution.”4
   I further agree with the plurality that there are weighty
arguments supporting petitioners’ second submission,
insofar as it concerns the possession of firearms for lawful
self-defense in the home. But these arguments are less
compelling than the plurality suggests; they are much less
compelling when applied outside the home; and their
validity does not depend on the Court’s holding in Heller.
For that holding sheds no light on the meaning of the Due

Clause, 12 Harv. J. L. &amp; Pub. Pol’y 43, 52 (1989). Judge Wilkinson’s
point is broader than the privileges or immunities debate. As he
observes, “there may be more structure imposed by provisions subject
to generations of elaboration and refinement than by a provision in its
pristine state. The fortuities of uneven constitutional development
must be respected, not cast aside in the illusion of reordering the
landscape anew.” Id., at 51–52; see also Washington v. Glucksberg, 521

substantive rights”).

States likewise tell us little about the meaning of the word
“liberty” in the Clause or about the scope of its protection
of nonprocedural rights.
   This is a substantive due process case.
                               I
  Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment decrees that no
State shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law.” The Court has filled thou­
sands of pages expounding that spare text. As I read the
vast corpus of substantive due process opinions, they
confirm several important principles that ought to guide
our resolution of this case. The principal opinion’s lengthy
summary of our “incorporation” doctrine, see ante, at 5–9,
11–19 (majority opinion), 10–11 (plurality opinion), and its
implicit (and untenable) effort to wall off that doctrine
from the rest of our substantive due process jurisprudence,
invite a fresh survey of this old terrain.
Substantive Content
  The first, and most basic, principle established by our
cases is that the rights protected by the Due Process
Clause are not merely procedural in nature. At first
glance, this proposition might seem surprising, given that
the Clause refers to “process.” But substance and proce­
dure are often deeply entwined. Upon closer inspection,
the text can be read to “impos[e] nothing less than an
obligation to give substantive content to the words ‘liberty’
and ‘due process of law,’ ” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521
U. S. 702, 764 (1997) (Souter, J., concurring in judgment),
lest superficially fair procedures be permitted to “destroy
the enjoyment” of life, liberty, and property, Poe v. Ull­
man, 367 U. S. 497, 541 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting),
and the Clause’s prepositional modifier be permitted to
swallow its primary command. Procedural guarantees are
hollow unless linked to substantive interests; and no

amount of process can legitimize some deprivations.
  I have yet to see a persuasive argument that the Fram­
ers of the Fourteenth Amendment thought otherwise. To
the contrary, the historical evidence suggests that, at least
by the time of the Civil War if not much earlier, the
phrase “due process of law” had acquired substantive
content as a term of art within the legal community.5 This
understanding is consonant with the venerable “notion
that governmental authority has implied limits which

preserve private autonomy,”6 a notion which predates the
founding and which finds reinforcement in the Constitu­
tion’s Ninth Amendment, see Griswold v. Connecticut, 381
U. S. 479, 486–493 (1965) (Goldberg, J., concurring).7 The
Due Process Clause cannot claim to be the source of our
basic freedoms—no legal document ever could, see
Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215, 230 (1976) (STEVENS, J.,
dissenting)—but it stands as one of their foundational
guarantors in our law.
   If text and history are inconclusive on this point, our
precedent leaves no doubt: It has been “settled” for well
over a century that the Due Process Clause “applies to
matters of substantive law as well as to matters of proce­
dure.” Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 373 (1927)
(Brandeis, J., concurring). Time and again, we have rec­
ognized that in the Fourteenth Amendment as well as the
Fifth, the “Due Process Clause guarantees more than fair
process, and the ‘liberty’ it protects includes more than the
absence of physical restraint.” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at
719. “The Clause also includes a substantive component
that ‘provides heightened protection against government
interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty
interests.’ ” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U. S. 57, 65 (2000)
(opinion of O’Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and
GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ.) (quoting Glucksberg, 521
U. S., at 720). Some of our most enduring precedents,
accepted today by virtually everyone, were substantive
due process decisions. See, e.g., Loving v. Virginia, 388
U. S. 1, 12 (1967) (recognizing due-process- as well as
equal-protection-based right to marry person of another
race); Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497, 499–500 (1954)

Liberty
   The second principle woven through our cases is that
substantive due process is fundamentally a matter of
personal liberty. For it is the liberty clause of the Four­
teenth Amendment that grounds our most important
holdings in this field. It is the liberty clause that enacts
the Constitution’s “promise” that a measure of dignity and
self-rule will be afforded to all persons. Planned Parent­
hood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 847
(1992). It is the liberty clause that reflects and renews
“the origins of the American heritage of freedom [and] the
abiding interest in individual liberty that makes certain
state intrusions on the citizen’s right to decide how he will
live his own life intolerable.” Fitzgerald v. Porter Memo­
rial Hospital, 523 F. 2d 716, 720 (CA7 1975) (Stevens, J.).
Our substantive due process cases have episodically in­
voked values such as privacy and equality as well, values
that in certain contexts may intersect with or complement
a subject’s liberty interests in profound ways. But as I
have observed on numerous occasions, “most of the signifi­
cant [20th-century] cases raising Bill of Rights issues
have, in the final analysis, actually interpreted the word
‘liberty’ in the Fourteenth Amendment.”8
   It follows that the term “incorporation,” like the term
“unenumerated rights,” is something of a misnomer.

Whether an asserted substantive due process interest is
explicitly named in one of the first eight Amendments to
the Constitution or is not mentioned, the underlying in­
quiry is the same: We must ask whether the interest is
“comprised within the term liberty.” Whitney, 274 U. S.,
at 373 (Brandeis, J., concurring). As the second Justice
Harlan has shown, ever since the Court began considering
the applicability of the Bill of Rights to the States, “the
Court’s usual approach has been to ground the prohibi­
tions against state action squarely on due process, without
intermediate reliance on any of the first eight Amend­
ments.” Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 24 (1964) (dissent­
ing opinion); see also Frankfurter, Memorandum on “In­
corporation” of the Bill of Rights into the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, 78 Harv. L. Rev.
746, 747–750 (1965). In the pathmarking case of Gitlow v.
New York, 268 U. S. 652, 666 (1925), for example, both the
majority and dissent evaluated petitioner’s free speech
claim not under the First Amendment but as an aspect of
“the fundamental personal rights and ‘liberties’ protected
by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
from impairment by the States.”9
——————
  9 See also Gitlow, 268 U. S., at 672 (Holmes, J., dissenting) (“The

general principle of free speech, it seems to me, must be taken to be
included in the Fourteenth Amendment, in view of the scope that has
been given to the word ‘liberty’ as there used, although perhaps it may
be accepted with a somewhat larger latitude of interpretation than is
allowed to Congress by the sweeping language that governs or ought to
govern the laws of the United States”). Subsequent decisions repeat­
edly reaffirmed that persons hold free speech rights against the States
on account of the Fourteenth Amendment’s liberty clause, not the First
Amendment per se. See, e.g., NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357
U. S. 449, 460, 466 (1958); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 303

  In his own classic opinion in Griswold, 381 U. S., at 500
(concurring in judgment), Justice Harlan memorably
distilled these precedents’ lesson: “While the relevant
inquiry may be aided by resort to one or more of the provi­
sions of the Bill of Rights, it is not dependent on them or
any of their radiations. The Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment stands . . . on its own bottom.”10
Inclusion in the Bill of Rights is neither necessary nor
sufficient for an interest to be judicially enforceable under
the Fourteenth Amendment. This Court’s “ ‘selective
incorporation’ ” doctrine, ante, at 15, is not simply “related”
to substantive due process, ante, at 19; it is a subset
thereof.
Federal/State Divergence
  The third precept to emerge from our case law flows from
the second: The rights protected against state infringement
by the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause need
not be identical in shape or scope to the rights protected
against Federal Government infringement by the various
provisions of the Bill of Rights. As drafted, the Bill of

same basic approach to “incorporation,” with the Fourteenth Amend­
ment taken as a distinct source of rights independent from the first
eight Amendments. Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 322–328
(1937) (opinion for the Court by Cardozo, J.); Adamson v. California,
332 U. S. 46, 59–68 (1947) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).
   10 See also Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25, 26 (1949) (“The notion that

the ‘due process of law’ guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment is
shorthand for the first eight amendments of the Constitution . . . has
been rejected by this Court again and again, after impressive consid­
eration. . . . The issue is closed”). Wolf’s holding on the exclusionary
rule was overruled by Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961), but the
principle just quoted has never been disturbed. It is notable that
Mapp, the case that launched the modern “doctrine of ad hoc,” “ ‘jot-for­
jot’ ” incorporation, Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78, 130–131 (1970)
(Harlan, J., concurring in result), expressly held “that the exclusionary
rule is an essential part of both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amend­
ments.” 367 U. S., at 657 (emphasis added).

Amendment profoundly altered our legal order, it “did not
unstitch the basic federalist pattern woven into our consti­
tutional fabric.” Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78, 133
(1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in result). Nor, for that
matter, did it expressly alter the Bill of Rights. The Con­
stitution still envisions a system of divided sovereignty,
still “establishes a federal republic where local differences
are to be cherished as elements of liberty” in the vast run
of cases, National Rifle Assn. of Am. Inc. v. Chicago, 567
F. 3d 856, 860 (CA7 2009) (Easterbrook, C. J.), still allo­
cates a general “police power . . . to the States and the
States alone,” United States v. Comstock, 560 U. S. ___, ___
(2010) (slip op., at 4) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judg­
ment). Elementary considerations of constitutional text
and structure suggest there may be legitimate reasons to
hold state governments to different standards than the
Federal Government in certain areas.11
   It is true, as the Court emphasizes, ante, at 15–19, that
we have made numerous provisions of the Bill of Rights
fully applicable to the States. It is settled, for instance,
that the Governor of Alabama has no more power than the
President of the United States to authorize unreasonable
searches and seizures. Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23
(1963). But we have never accepted a “total incorporation”
theory of the Fourteenth Amendment, whereby the
Amendment is deemed to subsume the provisions of the
Bill of Rights en masse. See ante, at 15. And we have
declined to apply several provisions to the States in any

measure. See, e.g., Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis R. Co. v.
Bombolis, 241 U. S. 211 (1916) (Seventh Amendment);
Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884) (Grand Jury
Clause). We have, moreover, resisted a uniform approach
to the Sixth Amendment’s criminal jury guarantee, de­
manding 12-member panels and unanimous verdicts in
federal trials, yet not in state trials. See Apodaca v. Ore­
gon, 406 U. S. 404 (1972) (plurality opinion); Williams, 399
U. S. 78. In recent years, the Court has repeatedly de­
clined to grant certiorari to review that disparity.12 While
those denials have no precedential significance, they
confirm the proposition that the “incorporation” of a provi­
sion of the Bill of Rights into the Fourteenth Amendment
does not, in itself, mean the provision must have precisely
the same meaning in both contexts.
   It is true, as well, that during the 1960’s the Court
decided a number of cases involving procedural rights in
which it treated the Due Process Clause as if it trans­
planted language from the Bill of Rights into the Four­
teenth Amendment. See, e.g., Benton v. Maryland, 395
U. S. 784, 795 (1969) (Double Jeopardy Clause); Pointer v.
Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 406 (1965) (Confrontation Clause).
“Jot-for-jot” incorporation was the norm in this expansion­
ary era. Yet at least one subsequent opinion suggests that
these precedents require perfect state/federal congruence
only on matters “ ‘at the core’ ” of the relevant constitutional
guarantee. Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S. 28, 37 (1978); see also
id., at 52–53 (Powell, J., dissenting). In my judgment, this
line of cases is best understood as having concluded that, to

fairness, some procedures should be the same in state and
federal courts: The need for certainty and uniformity is
more pressing, and the margin for error slimmer, when
criminal justice is at issue. That principle has little rele­
vance to the question whether a nonprocedural rule set
forth in the Bill of Rights qualifies as an aspect of the lib­
erty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.
   Notwithstanding some overheated dicta in Malloy, 378
U. S., at 10–11, it is therefore an overstatement to say
that the Court has “abandoned,” ante, at 16, 17 (majority
opinion), 39 (plurality opinion), a “two-track approach to
incorporation,” ante, at 37 (plurality opinion). The Court
moved away from that approach in the area of criminal
procedure. But the Second Amendment differs in funda­
mental respects from its neighboring provisions in the Bill
of Rights, as I shall explain in Part V, infra; and if some
1960’s opinions purported to establish a general method of
incorporation, that hardly binds us in this case. The Court
has not hesitated to cut back on perceived Warren Court
excesses in more areas than I can count.
   I do not mean to deny that there can be significant
practical, as well as esthetic, benefits from treating rights
symmetrically with regard to the State and Federal Gov­
ernments. Jot-for-jot incorporation of a provision may
entail greater protection of the right at issue and therefore
greater freedom for those who hold it; jot-for-jot incorpora­
tion may also yield greater clarity about the contours of
the legal rule. See Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U. S. 356,
384–388 (1972) (Douglas, J., dissenting); Pointer, 380
U. S., at 413–414 (Goldberg, J., concurring). In a federal­
ist system such as ours, however, this approach can carry
substantial costs. When a federal court insists that state
and local authorities follow its dictates on a matter not
critical to personal liberty or procedural justice, the latter
may be prevented from engaging in the kind of beneficent
“experimentation in things social and economic” that

ultimately redounds to the benefit of all Americans. New
State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932)
(Brandeis, J., dissenting). The costs of federal courts’
imposing a uniform national standard may be especially
high when the relevant regulatory interests vary signifi­
cantly across localities, and when the ruling implicates the
States’ core police powers.
  Furthermore, there is a real risk that, by demanding the
provisions of the Bill of Rights apply identically to the
States, federal courts will cause those provisions to “be
watered down in the needless pursuit of uniformity.”
Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 182, n. 21 (1968)
(Harlan, J., dissenting). When one legal standard must
prevail across dozens of jurisdictions with disparate needs
and customs, courts will often settle on a relaxed stan­
dard. This watering-down risk is particularly acute when
we move beyond the narrow realm of criminal procedure
and into the relatively vast domain of substantive rights.
So long as the requirements of fundamental fairness are
always and everywhere respected, it is not clear that
greater liberty results from the jot-for-jot application of a
provision of the Bill of Rights to the States. Indeed, it is
far from clear that proponents of an individual right to
keep and bear arms ought to celebrate today’s decision.13
——————
   13 The vast majority of States already recognize a right to keep and

bear arms in their own constitutions, see Volokh, State Constitutional
Rights to Keep and Bear Arms, 11 Tex. Rev. L. &amp; Pol. 191 (2006)
(cataloguing provisions); Brief for Petitioners 69 (observing that
“[t]hese Second Amendment analogs are effective and consequential”),
but the States vary widely in their regulatory schemes, their traditions
and cultures of firearm use, and their problems relating to gun vio­
lence. If federal and state courts must harmonize their review of gun­
control laws under the Second Amendment, the resulting jurisprudence
may prove significantly more deferential to those laws than the status
quo ante. Once it has been established that a single legal standard
must govern nationwide, federal courts will face a profound pressure to
reconcile that standard with the diverse interests of the States and

   So far, I have explained that substantive due process
analysis generally requires us to consider the term “lib­
erty” in the Fourteenth Amendment, and that this inquiry
may be informed by but does not depend upon the content
of the Bill of Rights. How should a court go about the
analysis, then? Our precedents have established, not an
exact methodology, but rather a framework for decision­
making. In this respect, too, the Court’s narrative fails to
capture the continuity and flexibility in our doctrine.
   The basic inquiry was described by Justice Cardozo
more than 70 years ago. When confronted with a substan­
tive due process claim, we must ask whether the allegedly
unlawful practice violates values “implicit in the concept
of ordered liberty.” Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319,
325 (1937).14 If the practice in question lacks any “oppres­
sive and arbitrary” character, if judicial enforcement of the
asserted right would not materially contribute to “a fair
and enlightened system of justice,” then the claim is un­

their long history of regulating in this sensitive area. Cf. Williams, 399 

U. S., at 129–130 (Harlan, J., concurring in result) (noting “ ‘backlash’ ”
potential of jot-for-jot incorporation); Grant, Felix Frankfurter: A
Dissenting Opinion, 12 UCLA L. Rev. 1013, 1038 (1965) (“If the Court
will not reduce the requirements of the fourteenth amendment below
the federal gloss that now overlays the Bill of Rights, then it will have
to reduce that gloss to the point where the states can live with it”).
Amici argue persuasively that, post-“incorporation,” federal courts will

   14 Justice Cardozo’s test itself built upon an older line of decisions.

See, e.g., Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226, 237 (1897)
(discussing “limitations on [state] power, which grow out of the essen­
tial nature of all free governments [and] implied reservations of indi­
vidual rights, . . . and which are respected by all governments entitled
to the name” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

suitable for substantive due process protection. Id., at
327, 325. Implicit in Justice Cardozo’s test is a recognition
that the postulates of liberty have a universal character.
Liberty claims that are inseparable from the customs that
prevail in a certain region, the idiosyncratic expectations
of a certain group, or the personal preferences of their
champions, may be valid claims in some sense; but they
are not of constitutional stature. Whether conceptualized
as a “rational continuum” of legal precepts, Poe, 367 U. S.,
at 543 (Harlan, J., dissenting), or a seamless web of moral
commitments, the rights embraced by the liberty clause
transcend the local and the particular.
   Justice Cardozo’s test undeniably requires judges to
apply their own reasoned judgment, but that does not
mean it involves an exercise in abstract philosophy. In
addition to other constraints I will soon discuss, see Part
III, infra, historical and empirical data of various kinds
ground the analysis. Textual commitments laid down
elsewhere in the Constitution, judicial precedents, English
common law, legislative and social facts, scientific and
professional developments, practices of other civilized
societies,15 and, above all else, the “ ‘traditions and con­
science of our people,’ ” Palko, 302 U. S., at 325 (quoting
Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934)), are
critical variables. They can provide evidence about which
rights really are vital to ordered liberty, as well as a spur
to judicial action.
   The Court errs both in its interpretation of Palko and in
its suggestion that later cases rendered Palko’s methodol­
ogy defunct. Echoing Duncan, the Court advises that
Justice Cardozo’s test will not be satisfied “ ‘if a civilized
system could be imagined that would not accord the par­

539 U. S. 558, 572–573, 576–577 (2003); Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 710–

ticular protection.’ ” Ante, at 12 (quoting 391 U. S., at 149,
n. 14). Palko does contain some language that could be
read to set an inordinate bar to substantive due process
recognition, reserving it for practices without which “nei­
ther liberty nor justice would exist.” 302 U. S., at 326.
But in view of Justice Cardozo’s broader analysis, as well
as the numerous cases that have upheld liberty claims
under the Palko standard, such readings are plainly over­
readings. We have never applied Palko in such a draco­
nian manner.
   Nor, as the Court intimates, see ante, at 16, did Duncan
mark an irreparable break from Palko, swapping out
liberty for history. Duncan limited its discussion to “par­
ticular procedural safeguard[s]” in the Bill of Rights relat­
ing to “criminal processes,” 391 U. S., at 149, n. 14; it did
not purport to set a standard for other types of liberty
interests. Even with regard to procedural safeguards,
Duncan did not jettison the Palko test so much as refine it:
The judge is still tasked with evaluating whether a prac­
tice “is fundamental . . . to ordered liberty,” within the
context of the “Anglo-American” system. Duncan, 391
U. S., at 149–150, n. 14. Several of our most important
recent decisions confirm the proposition that substantive
due process analysis—from which, once again, “incorpora­
tion” analysis derives—must not be wholly backward
looking. See, e.g., Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 572
(2003) (“[H]istory and tradition are the starting point but
not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due
process inquiry” (internal quotation marks omitted));

odology that “consult[s] the most specific tradition avail­
able”); see also post, at 6–7 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (ex­

to rely on more than history).16
   The Court’s flight from Palko leaves its analysis, careful
and scholarly though it is, much too narrow to provide a
satisfying answer to this case. The Court hinges its entire
decision on one mode of intellectual history, culling se­
lected pronouncements and enactments from the 18th and
19th centuries to ascertain what Americans thought about
firearms. Relying on Duncan and Glucksberg, the plural­
ity suggests that only interests that have proved “funda­
mental from an American perspective,” ante, at 37, 44, or
“ ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,’ ”
ante, at 19 (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721), to the
Court’s satisfaction, may qualify for incorporation into the
Fourteenth Amendment. To the extent the Court’s opin­
ion could be read to imply that the historical pedigree of a
right is the exclusive or dispositive determinant of its
status under the Due Process Clause, the opinion is seri­
ously mistaken.
   A rigid historical test is inappropriate in this case, most
basically, because our substantive due process doctrine
has never evaluated substantive rights in purely, or even
predominantly, historical terms. When the Court applied
many of the procedural guarantees in the Bill of Rights to
the States in the 1960’s, it often asked whether the guar­
antee in question was “fundamental in the context of the
criminal processes maintained by the American States.”17
——————
  16 I acknowledge that some have read the Court’s opinion in Glucks­
berg as an attempt to move substantive due process analysis, for all
purposes, toward an exclusively historical methodology—and thereby to
debilitate the doctrine. If that were ever Glucksberg’s aspiration,
Lawrence plainly renounced it. As between Glucksberg and Lawrence, I
have little doubt which will prove the more enduring precedent.
  17 The Court almost never asked whether the guarantee in question

was deeply rooted in founding-era practice. See Brief for Respondent
City of Chicago et al. 31, n. 17 (hereinafter Municipal Respondents’
Brief) (noting that only two opinions extensively discussed such his­
tory).

Duncan, 391 U. S., at 150, n. 14. That inquiry could ex­
tend back through time, but it was focused not so much on
historical conceptions of the guarantee as on its functional
significance within the States’ regimes. This contextual­
ized approach made sense, as the choice to employ any
given trial-type procedure means little in the abstract. It
is only by inquiring into how that procedure intermeshes
with other procedures and practices in a criminal justice
system that its relationship to “liberty” and “due process”
can be determined.
   Yet when the Court has used the Due Process Clause to
recognize rights distinct from the trial context—rights
relating to the primary conduct of free individuals—
Justice Cardozo’s test has been our guide. The right to
free speech, for instance, has been safeguarded from state
infringement not because the States have always honored
it, but because it is “essential to free government” and “to
the maintenance of democratic institutions”—that is,
because the right to free speech is implicit in the concept
of ordered liberty. Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 95,
96 (1940); see also, e.g., Loving, 388 U. S., at 12 (discuss­
ing right to marry person of another race); Mapp v. Ohio,
367 U. S. 643, 650, 655–657 (1961) (discussing right to be
free from arbitrary intrusion by police); Schneider v. State
(Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147, 161 (1939) (discussing
right to distribute printed matter).18 While the verbal
formula has varied, the Court has largely been consistent
in its liberty-based approach to substantive interests
outside of the adjudicatory system. As the question before

us indisputably concerns such an interest, the answer
cannot be found in a granular inspection of state constitu­
tions or congressional debates.
   More fundamentally, a rigid historical methodology is
unfaithful to the Constitution’s command. For if it were
really the case that the Fourteenth Amendment’s guaran­
tee of liberty embraces only those rights “so rooted in our
history, tradition, and practice as to require special protec­
tion,” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721, n. 17, then the guar­
antee would serve little function, save to ratify those
rights that state actors have already been according the
most extensive protection.19 Cf. Duncan, 391 U. S., at 183
(Harlan, J., dissenting) (critiquing “circular[ity]” of his­
toricized test for incorporation). That approach is unfaith­
ful to the expansive principle Americans laid down when
they ratified the Fourteenth Amendment and to the level
of generality they chose when they crafted its language; it
promises an objectivity it cannot deliver and masks the
value judgments that pervade any analysis of what cus­
toms, defined in what manner, are sufficiently “ ‘rooted’ ”;
it countenances the most revolting injustices in the name
of continuity,20 for we must never forget that not only
slavery but also the subjugation of women and other rank
forms of discrimination are part of our history; and it
effaces this Court’s distinctive role in saying what the law
is, leaving the development and safekeeping of liberty to
majoritarian political processes. It is judicial abdication in

  21 JUSTICE  KENNEDY has made the point movingly:
  “Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the
Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the compo­
nents of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have been more
specific. They did not presume to have this insight. They knew times
can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws
once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress. As the
Constitution endures, persons in every generation can invoke its
principles in their own search for greater freedom.” Lawrence, 539
U. S., at 578–579.
  22 Contrary to JUSTICE SCALIA’s suggestion, I emphatically do not

believe that “only we judges” can interpret the Fourteenth Amendment,
ante, at 4, or any other constitutional provision. All Americans can; all
Americans should. I emphatically do believe that we judges must
exercise—indeed, cannot help but exercise—our own reasoned judg­
ment in so doing. JUSTICE SCALIA and I are on common ground in
maintaining that courts should be “guided by what the American

                              III
   At this point a difficult question arises. In considering
such a majestic term as “liberty” and applying it to present
circumstances, how are we to do justice to its urgent call
and its open texture—and to the grant of interpretive
discretion the latter embodies—without injecting excessive
subjectivity or unduly restricting the States’ “broad lati­
tude in experimenting with possible solutions to problems
of vital local concern,” Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 597
(1977)? One part of the answer, already discussed, is that
we must ground the analysis in historical experience and
reasoned judgment, and never on “merely personal and
private notions.” Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 170
(1952). Our precedents place a number of additional
constraints on the decisional process. Although “guide­
posts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered
area are scarce and open-ended,” Collins v. Harker
Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125 (1992), significant guideposts
do exist.23
——————
people throughout our history have thought.” Ibid. Where we part
ways is in his view that courts should be guided only by historical
considerations.
  There is, moreover, a tension between JUSTICE SCALIA’s concern that
“courts have the last word” on constitutional questions, ante, at 3, n. 2,
on the one hand, and his touting of the Constitution’s Article V amend­
ment process, ante, at 3, on the other. The American people can of
course reverse this Court’s rulings through that same process.
  23 In assessing concerns about the “open-ended[ness]” of this area of

law, Collins, 503 U. S., at 125, one does well to keep in view the malle­
ability not only of the Court’s “deeply rooted”/fundamentality standard
but also of substantive due process’ constitutional cousin, “equal
protection” analysis. Substantive due process is sometimes accused of
entailing an insufficiently “restrained methodology.” Glucksberg, 521
U. S., at 721. Yet “the word ‘liberty’ in the Due Process Clause seems to
provide at least as much meaningful guidance as does the word ‘equal’
in the Equal Protection Clause.” Post, The Supreme Court 2002

and Law, 117 Harv. L. Rev. 4, 94, n. 440 (2003). And “[i]f the objection
22                    MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                        STEVENS, J., dissenting

   The most basic is that we have eschewed attempts to
provide any all-purpose, top-down, totalizing theory of
“liberty.”24 That project is bound to end in failure or
worse. The Framers did not express a clear understand­
ing of the term to guide us, and the now-repudiated
Lochner line of cases attests to the dangers of judicial
overconfidence in using substantive due process to ad­
vance a broad theory of the right or the good. See, e.g.,
Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905). In its most
durable precedents, the Court “has not attempted to define
with exactness the liberty . . . guaranteed” by the Four­
teenth Amendment. Meyer, 262 U. S., at 399; see also,
e.g., Bolling, 347 U. S, at 499. By its very nature, the
meaning of liberty cannot be “reduced to any formula; its
content cannot be determined by reference to any code.”
Poe, 367 U. S., at 542 (Harlan, J., dissenting).
   Yet while “the ‘liberty’ specially protected by the Four­
teenth Amendment” is “perhaps not capable of being fully
clarified,” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 722, it is capable of
being refined and delimited. We have insisted that only
certain types of especially significant personal interests
may qualify for especially heightened protection. Ever
since “the deviant economic due process cases [were]
repudiated,” id., at 761 (Souter, J., concurring in judg­
——————
is that the text of the [Due Process] Clause warrants providing only
protections of process rather than protections of substance,” “it is
striking that even those Justices who are most theoretically opposed to
substantive due process, like Scalia and Rehnquist, are also nonethe­
less enthusiastic about applying the equal protection component of the
Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the federal govern­
ment.” Ibid. (citing Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200,
213–231 (1995)).
  24 That one eschews a comprehensive theory of liberty does not, pace

JUSTICE SCALIA, mean that one lacks “a coherent theory of the Due
Process Clause,” ante, at 5. It means that one lacks the hubris to adopt
a rigid, context-independent definition of a constitutional guarantee
that was deliberately framed in open-ended terms.

ment), our doctrine has steered away from “laws that
touch economic problems, business affairs, or social condi­
tions,” Griswold, 381 U. S., at 482, and has instead cen­
tered on “matters relating to marriage, procreation, con­
traception, family relationships, and child rearing and
education,” Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S. 693, 713 (1976).
These categories are not exclusive. Government action
that shocks the conscience, pointlessly infringes settled
expectations, trespasses into sensitive private realms or
life choices without adequate justification, perpetrates
gross injustice, or simply lacks a rational basis will always
be vulnerable to judicial invalidation. Nor does the fact
that an asserted right falls within one of these categories
end the inquiry. More fundamental rights may receive
more robust judicial protection, but the strength of the
individual’s liberty interests and the State’s regulatory
interests must always be assessed and compared. No
right is absolute.
   Rather than seek a categorical understanding of the
liberty clause, our precedents have thus elucidated a
conceptual core. The clause safeguards, most basically,
“the ability independently to define one’s identity,” Roberts
v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 619 (1984), “the
individual’s right to make certain unusually important
decisions that will affect his own, or his family’s, destiny,”
Fitzgerald, 523 F. 2d, at 719, and the right to be respected
as a human being. Self-determination, bodily integrity,
freedom of conscience, intimate relationships, political
equality, dignity and respect—these are the central values
we have found implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.
   Another key constraint on substantive due process
analysis is respect for the democratic process. If a particu­
lar liberty interest is already being given careful consid­
eration in, and subjected to ongoing calibration by, the
States, judicial enforcement may not be appropriate.
When the Court declined to establish a general right to
24                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                    STEVENS, J., dissenting

physician-assisted suicide, for example, it did so in part
because “the States [were] currently engaged in serious,
thoughtful examinations of physician-assisted suicide and
other similar issues,” rendering judicial intervention both
less necessary and potentially more disruptive. Glucks­
berg, 521 U. S., at 719, 735. Conversely, we have long
appreciated that more “searching” judicial review may be
justified when the rights of “discrete and insular minori­
ties”—groups that may face systematic barriers in the
political system—are at stake. United States v. Carolene
Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 153, n. 4 (1938). Courts have
a “comparative . . . advantage” over the elected branches
on a limited, but significant, range of legal matters. Post,
at 8.
   Recognizing a new liberty right is a momentous step. It
takes that right, to a considerable extent, “outside the
arena of public debate and legislative action.” Glucksberg,
521 U. S., at 720. Sometimes that momentous step must
be taken; some fundamental aspects of personhood, dig­
nity, and the like do not vary from State to State, and
demand a baseline level of protection. But sensitivity to
the interaction between the intrinsic aspects of liberty and
the practical realities of contemporary society provides an
important tool for guiding judicial discretion.
   This sensitivity is an aspect of a deeper principle: the
need to approach our work with humility and caution.
Because the relevant constitutional language is so “spa­
cious,” Duncan, 391 U. S., at 148, I have emphasized that
“[t]he doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to
exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break
new ground in this field.” Collins, 503 U. S., at 125. Many
of my colleagues and predecessors have stressed the same
point, some with great eloquence. See, e.g., Casey, 505
U. S., at 849; Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 502–
503 (1977) (plurality opinion); Poe, 367 U. S., at 542–545
(Harlan, J., dissenting); Adamson v. California, 332 U. S.

                    STEVENS, J., dissenting

46, 68 (1947) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). Historical
study may discipline as well as enrich the analysis. But
the inescapable reality is that no serious theory of Section
1 of the Fourteenth Amendment yields clear answers in
every case, and “[n]o formula could serve as a substitute,
in this area, for judgment and restraint.” Poe, 367 U. S.,
at 542 (Harlan, J., dissenting).
   Several rules of the judicial process help enforce such
restraint. In the substantive due process field as in oth­
ers, the Court has applied both the doctrine of stare de­
cisis—adhering to precedents, respecting reliance inter­
ests, prizing stability and order in the law—and the
common-law method—taking cases and controversies as
they present themselves, proceeding slowly and incremen­
tally, building on what came before. This restrained
methodology was evident even in the heyday of “incorpora­
tion” during the 1960’s. Although it would have been
much easier for the Court simply to declare certain
Amendments in the Bill of Rights applicable to the States
in toto, the Court took care to parse each Amendment into
its component guarantees, evaluating them one by one.
This piecemeal approach allowed the Court to scrutinize
more closely the right at issue in any given dispute, reduc­
ing both the risk and the cost of error.
   Relatedly, rather than evaluate liberty claims on an
abstract plane, the Court has “required in substantive­
due-process cases a ‘careful description’ of the asserted
fundamental liberty interest.” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at
721 (quoting Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993);
Collins, 503 U. S., at 125; Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of
Health, 497 U. S. 261, 277–278 (1990)). And just as we
have required such careful description from the litigants,
we have required of ourselves that we “focus on the allega­
tions in the complaint to determine how petitioner de­
scribes the constitutional right at stake.” Collins, 503
U. S., at 125; see also Stevens, Judicial Restraint, 22 San
26                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                         STEVENS, J., dissenting

Diego L. Rev. 437, 446–448 (1985). This does not mean
that we must define the asserted right at the most specific
level, thereby sapping it of a universal valence and a
moral force it might otherwise have.25 It means, simply,
that we must pay close attention to the precise liberty
interest the litigants have asked us to vindicate.
   Our holdings should be similarly tailored. Even if the
most expansive formulation of a claim does not qualify for
substantive due process recognition, particular compo­
nents of the claim might. Just because there may not be a
categorical right to physician-assisted suicide, for exam­
ple, does not “ ‘foreclose the possibility that an individual
plaintiff seeking to hasten her death, or a doctor whose
assistance was sought, could prevail in a more particular­
ized challenge.’ ” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 735, n. 24

  25 The notion that we should define liberty claims at the most specific
level available is one of JUSTICE SCALIA’s signal contributions to the
theory of substantive due process. See, e.g., Michael H. v. Gerald D.,

Lawrence as the freedom to perform specific sex acts, ante, at 2, the
interest starts to look less compelling. The Court today does not follow
JUSTICE SCALIA’s “particularizing” method, Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384
U. S. 641, 649 (1966), as it relies on general historical references to
keeping and bearing arms, without any close study of the States’
practice of regulating especially dangerous weapons.

   As this discussion reflects, to acknowledge that the task
of construing the liberty clause requires judgment is not to
say that it is a license for unbridled judicial lawmaking.
To the contrary, only an honest reckoning with our discre­
tion allows for honest argumentation and meaningful
accountability.

   The question in this case, then, is not whether the Sec­
ond Amendment right to keep and bear arms (whatever
that right’s precise contours) applies to the States because
the Amendment has been incorporated into the Four­
teenth Amendment. It has not been. The question,
rather, is whether the particular right asserted by peti­
tioners applies to the States because of the Fourteenth
Amendment itself, standing on its own bottom. And to
answer that question, we need to determine, first, the
nature of the right that has been asserted and, second,
whether that right is an aspect of Fourteenth Amendment
“liberty.” Even accepting the Court’s holding in Heller, it
remains entirely possible that the right to keep and bear
arms identified in that opinion is not judicially enforceable
against the States, or that only part of the right is so
enforceable.26 It is likewise possible for the Court to find

  26 In District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (slip op., at 22),

the Court concluded, over my dissent, that the Second Amendment
confers “an individual right to keep and bear arms” disconnected from
militia service. If that conclusion were wrong, then petitioners’ “incor­
poration” claim clearly would fail, as they would hold no right against
the Federal Government to be free from regulations such as the ones
they challenge. Cf. post, at 8. I do not understand petitioners or any of
their amici to dispute this point. Yet even if Heller had never been
decided—indeed, even if the Second Amendment did not exist—we
would still have an obligation to address petitioners’ Fourteenth

in this case that some part of the Heller right applies to
the States, and then to find in later cases that other parts
of the right also apply, or apply on different terms.
   As noted at the outset, the liberty interest petitioners
have asserted is the “right to possess a functional, per­
sonal firearm, including a handgun, within the home.”
Complaint ¶34, App. 23. The city of Chicago allows resi­
dents to keep functional firearms, so long as they are
registered, but it generally prohibits the possession of
handguns, sawed-off shotguns, machine guns, and short­
barreled rifles. See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code §8–20–
050 (2009).27 Petitioners’ complaint centered on their
desire to keep a handgun at their domicile—it references
the “home” in nearly every paragraph, see Complaint ¶¶3–
4, 11–30, 32, 34, 37, 42, 44, 46, App. 17, 19–26—as did
their supporting declarations, see, e.g., App. 34, 36, 40, 43,
49–52, 54–56. Petitioners now frame the question that
confronts us as “[w]hether the Second Amendment right to
keep and bear arms is incorporated as against the States
by the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities
or Due Process Clauses.” Brief for Petitioners, p. i. But it
is our duty “to focus on the allegations in the complaint to
determine how petitioner describes the constitutional
right at stake,” Collins, 503 U. S., at 125, and the
gravamen of this complaint is plainly an appeal to keep a
handgun or other firearm of one’s choosing in the home.
   Petitioners’ framing of their complaint tracks the
Court’s ruling in Heller. The majority opinion contained
some dicta suggesting the possibility of a more expansive

arms-bearing right, one that would travel with the indi­
vidual to an extent into public places, as “in case of con­
frontation.” 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). But the
Heller plaintiff sought only dispensation to keep an oper­
able firearm in his home for lawful self-defense, see id., at
___ (slip op., at 2, and n. 2), and the Court’s opinion was
bookended by reminders that its holding was limited to
that one issue, id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 1, 64); accord,
ante, at 44 (plurality opinion). The distinction between
the liberty right these petitioners have asserted and the
Second Amendment right identified in Heller is therefore
evanescent. Both are rooted to the home. Moreover, even
if both rights have the logical potential to extend further,
upon “future evaluation,” Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,
at 63), it is incumbent upon us, as federal judges contem­
plating a novel rule that would bind all 50 States, to pro­
ceed cautiously and to decide only what must be decided.
   Understood as a plea to keep their preferred type of
firearm in the home, petitioners’ argument has real
force.28 The decision to keep a loaded handgun in the
house is often motivated by the desire to protect life, lib­
erty, and property. It is comparable, in some ways, to
decisions about the education and upbringing of one’s
children. For it is the kind of decision that may have
profound consequences for every member of the family,
and for the world beyond. In considering whether to keep
a handgun, heads of households must ask themselves
whether the desired safety benefits outweigh the risks of
deliberate or accidental misuse that may result in death or
serious injury, not only to residents of the home but to
——————
   28 To the extent that petitioners contend the city of Chicago’s registra­

tion requirements for firearm possessors also, and separately, violate
the Constitution, that claim borders on the frivolous. Petitioners make
no effort to demonstrate that the requirements are unreasonable or
that they impose a severe burden on the underlying right they have
asserted.

others as well. Millions of Americans have answered this
question in the affirmative, not infrequently because they
believe they have an inalienable right to do so—because
they consider it an aspect of “the supreme human dignity
of being master of one’s fate rather than a ward of the
State,” Indiana v. Edwards, 554 U. S. 164, 186 (2008)
(SCALIA, J., dissenting). Many such decisions have been
based, in part, on family traditions and deeply held beliefs
that are an aspect of individual autonomy the government
may not control.29
  Bolstering petitioners’ claim, our law has long recog­
nized that the home provides a kind of special sanctuary
in modern life. See, e.g., U. S. Const., Amdts. 3, 4; Law­
rence, 539 U. S., at 562, 567; Payton v. New York, 445
U. S. 573, 585–590 (1980); Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S.
557, 565–568 (1969); Griswold, 381 U. S., at 484–485.
Consequently, we have long accorded special deference to
the privacy of the home, whether a humble cottage or a
magnificent manse. This veneration of the domestic hark­
ens back to the common law. William Blackstone recog­
nized a “right of habitation,” 4 Commentaries *223, and
opined that “every man’s house is looked upon by the law
to be his castle of defence and asylum,” 3 id., at *288.
Heller carried forward this legacy, observing that “the
need for defense of self, family, and property is most
acute” in one’s abode, and celebrating “the right of law­
abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of
hearth and home.” 554 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 56,
63).
  While the individual’s interest in firearm possession is
thus heightened in the home, the State’s corresponding
interest in regulation is somewhat weaker. The State

generally has a lesser basis for regulating private as com­
pared to public acts, and firearms kept inside the home
generally pose a lesser threat to public welfare as com­
pared to firearms taken outside. The historical case for
regulation is likewise stronger outside the home, as many
States have for many years imposed stricter, and less
controversial, restrictions on the carriage of arms than on
their domestic possession. See, e.g., id., at ___ (slip op., at
54) (noting that “the majority of the 19th-century courts to
consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying
concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amend­
ment or state analogues”); English v. State, <span class="citation no-link">

ing the Home-Bound Second Amendment, 109 Colum.

   It is significant, as well, that a rule limiting the federal
constitutional right to keep and bear arms to the home
would be less intrusive on state prerogatives and easier to
administer. Having unleashed in Heller a tsunami of legal
uncertainty, and thus litigation,30 and now on the cusp of
imposing a national rule on the States in this area for the
first time in United States history, the Court could at least
moderate the confusion, upheaval, and burden on the

bounded in scope.
  In their briefs to this Court, several amici have sought
to bolster petitioners’ claim still further by invoking a
right to individual self-defense.31 As petitioners note, the
Heller majority discussed this subject extensively and
remarked that “[t]he inherent right of self-defense has
been central to the Second Amendment right.” 554 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 56). And it is true that if a State were
to try to deprive its residents of any reasonable means of
defending themselves from imminent physical threats, or
to deny persons any ability to assert self-defense in re­
sponse to criminal prosecution, that might pose a signifi­
cant constitutional problem. The argument that there is a
substantive due process right to be spared such untenable
dilemmas is a serious one.32

Other Fields as Amici Curiae; Brief for International Law Enforcement
Educators and Trainers Association et al. as Amici Curiae 29–45; Brief
for 34 California District Attorneys et al. as Amici Curiae 12–31.
  32 The argument that this Court should establish any such right,

however, faces steep hurdles. All 50 States already recognize self­
defense as a defense to criminal prosecution, see 2 P. Robinson, Crimi­
nal Law Defenses §132, p. 96 (1984 and Supp. 2009), so this is hardly
an interest to which the democratic process has been insensitive. And
the States have always diverged on how exactly to implement this
interest, so there is wide variety across the Nation in the types and
amounts of force that may be used, the necessity of retreat, the rights of
aggressors, the availability of the “castle doctrine,” and so forth. See
Brief for Oak Park Citizens Committee for Handgun Control as Amicus
Curiae 9–21; Brief for American Cities et al. as Amici Curiae 17–19; 2
W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law §10.4, pp. 142–160 (2d ed. 2003).
Such variation is presumed to be a healthy part of our federalist
system, as the States and localities select different rules in light of
different priorities, customs, and conditions.
  As a historical and theoretical matter, moreover, the legal status of
self-defense is far more complicated than it might first appear. We
have generally understood Fourteenth Amendment “liberty” as some­
thing one holds against direct state interference, whereas a personal
right of self-defense runs primarily against other individuals; absent

  But that is not the case before us. Petitioners have not
asked that we establish a constitutional right to individual
self-defense; neither their pleadings in the District Court
nor their filings in this Court make any such request. Nor
do petitioners contend that the city of Chicago—which,
recall, allows its residents to keep most rifles and shot­
guns, and to keep them loaded—has unduly burdened any
such right. What petitioners have asked is that we “incor­
porate” the Second Amendment and thereby establish a
constitutional entitlement, enforceable against the States,
to keep a handgun in the home.
  Of course, owning a handgun may be useful for practic­
ing self-defense. But the right to take a certain type of
action is analytically distinct from the right to acquire and
utilize specific instrumentalities in furtherance of that
action. And while some might favor handguns, it is not
——————
government tyranny, it is only when the state has failed to interfere
with (violent) private conduct that self-help becomes potentially neces­
sary. Moreover, it was a basic tenet of founding-era political philosophy
that, in entering civil society and gaining “the advantages of mutual
commerce” and the protections of the rule of law, one had to relinquish,
to a significant degree, “that wild and savage liberty” one possessed in
the state of nature. 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *125; see also, e.g.,
J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government §128, pp. 63–64 (J.
Gough ed. 1947) (in state of nature man has power “to do whatever he
thinks fit for the preservation of himself and others,” but this “he gives
up when he joins in a . . . particular political society”); Green v. Biddle,

      </span>, 63 (1823) (“It is a trite maxim, that man gives up a part of
his natural liberty when he enters into civil society, as the price of the
blessings of that state: and it may be said, with truth, that this liberty
is well exchanged for the advantages which flow from law and justice”).
Some strains of founding-era thought took a very narrow view of the
right to armed self-defense. See, e.g., Brief of Historians on Early
American Legal, Constitutional, and Pennsylvania History as Amici
Curiae 6–13 (discussing Whig and Quaker theories). Just because
there may be a natural or common-law right to some measure of self­
defense, it hardly follows that States may not place substantial restric­
tions on its exercise or that this Court should recognize a constitutional
right to the same.

                         STEVENS, J., dissenting

clear that they are a superior weapon for lawful self­
defense, and nothing in petitioners’ argument turns on
that being the case. The notion that a right of self-defense
implies an auxiliary right to own a certain type of firearm
presupposes not only controversial judgments about the
strength and scope of the (posited) self-defense right, but
also controversial assumptions about the likely effects
of making that type of firearm more broadly available. It
is a very long way from the proposition that the Four­
teenth Amendment protects a basic individual right of
self-defense to the conclusion that a city may not ban
handguns.33
  In short, while the utility of firearms, and handguns in
particular, to the defense of hearth and home is certainly
relevant to an assessment of petitioners’ asserted right,
there is no freestanding self-defense claim in this case.
The question we must decide is whether the interest in
keeping in the home a firearm of one’s choosing—a hand­
gun, for petitioners—is one that is “comprised within the
term liberty” in the Fourteenth Amendment. Whitney, 274
U. S., at 373 (Brandeis, J., concurring).


——————
  33 The Second Amendment right identified in Heller is likewise clearly

distinct from a right to protect oneself. In my view, the Court badly
misconstrued the Second Amendment in linking it to the value of
personal self-defense above and beyond the functioning of the state
militias; as enacted, the Second Amendment was concerned with
tyrants and invaders, and paradigmatically with the federal military,
not with criminals and intruders. But even still, the Court made clear
that self-defense plays a limited role in determining the scope and
substance of the Amendment’s guarantee. The Court struck down the
District of Columbia’s handgun ban not because of the utility of hand­
guns for lawful self-defense, but rather because of their popularity for
that purpose. See 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 57–58). And the Court’s
common-use gloss on the Second Amendment right, see id., at ___ (slip
op., at 55), as well as its discussion of permissible limitations on the
right, id., at ___ (slip op., at 54–55), had little to do with self-defense.

   While I agree with the Court that our substantive due
process cases offer a principled basis for holding that
petitioners have a constitutional right to possess a usable
fiream in the home, I am ultimately persuaded that a
better reading of our case law supports the city of Chicago.
I would not foreclose the possibility that a particular
plaintiff—say, an elderly widow who lives in a dangerous
neighborhood and does not have the strength to operate a
long gun—may have a cognizable liberty interest in pos­
sessing a handgun. But I cannot accept petitioners’
broader submission. A number of factors, taken together,
lead me to this conclusion.
   First, firearms have a fundamentally ambivalent rela­
tionship to liberty. Just as they can help homeowners
defend their families and property from intruders, they
can help thugs and insurrectionists murder innocent
victims. The threat that firearms will be misused is far
from hypothetical, for gun crime has devastated many of
our communities. Amici calculate that approximately one
million Americans have been wounded or killed by gunfire
in the last decade.34 Urban areas such as Chicago suffer
disproportionately from this epidemic of violence. Hand­
guns contribute disproportionately to it. Just as some
homeowners may prefer handguns because of their small
size, light weight, and ease of operation, some criminals
will value them for the same reasons. See Heller, 554
U. S., at ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 32–33).
In recent years, handguns were reportedly used in more
than four-fifths of firearm murders and more than half of

                         STEVENS, J., dissenting

all murders nationwide.35
   Hence, in evaluating an asserted right to be free from
particular gun-control regulations, liberty is on both sides
of the equation. Guns may be useful for self-defense, as
well as for hunting and sport, but they also have a unique
potential to facilitate death and destruction and thereby to
destabilize ordered liberty. Your interest in keeping and
bearing a certain firearm may diminish my interest in
being and feeling safe from armed violence. And while
granting you the right to own a handgun might make you
safer on any given day—assuming the handgun’s marginal
contribution to self-defense outweighs its marginal contri­
bution to the risk of accident, suicide, and criminal mis­
chief—it may make you and the community you live in
less safe overall, owing to the increased number of hand­
guns in circulation. It is at least reasonable for a democ­
ratically elected legislature to take such concerns into
account in considering what sorts of regulations would
best serve the public welfare.
   The practical impact of various gun-control measures
may be highly controversial, but this basic insight should
not be. The idea that deadly weapons pose a distinctive
threat to the social order—and that reasonable restric­
tions on their usage therefore impose an acceptable bur­
den on one’s personal liberty—is as old as the Republic.
As THE CHIEF JUSTICE observed just the other day, it is a
foundational premise of modern government that the
State holds a monopoly on legitimate violence: “A basic
step in organizing a civilized society is to take [the] sword
out of private hands and turn it over to an organized
government, acting on behalf of all the people.” Robertson

v. United States ex rel. Watson, ante, at ___ (slip op., at 11)
(dissenting opinion). The same holds true for the hand­
gun. The power a man has in the state of nature “of doing
whatsoever he thought fit for the preservation of himself
and the rest of mankind, he gives up,” to a significant
extent, “to be regulated by laws made by the society.”
J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government §129, p. 64
(J. Gough ed. 1947).
   Limiting the federal constitutional right to keep and
bear arms to the home complicates the analysis but does
not dislodge this conclusion. Even though the Court has
long afforded special solicitude for the privacy of the home,
we have never understood that principle to “infring[e]
upon” the authority of the States to proscribe certain
inherently dangerous items, for “[i]n such cases, compel­
ling reasons may exist for overriding the right of the indi­
vidual to possess those materials.” Stanley, 394 U. S., at
568, n. 11. And, of course, guns that start out in the home
may not stay in the home. Even if the government has a
weaker basis for restricting domestic possession of fire­
arms as compared to public carriage—and even if a blan­
ket, statewide prohibition on domestic possession might
therefore be unconstitutional—the line between the two is
a porous one. A state or local legislature may determine
that a prophylactic ban on an especially portable weapon
is necessary to police that line.
   Second, the right to possess a firearm of one’s choosing
is different in kind from the liberty interests we have
recognized under the Due Process Clause. Despite the
plethora of substantive due process cases that have been
decided in the post-Lochner century, I have found none
that holds, states, or even suggests that the term “liberty”
encompasses either the common-law right of self-defense
or a right to keep and bear arms. I do not doubt for a
moment that many Americans feel deeply passionate
about firearms, and see them as critical to their way of life
38                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                         STEVENS, J., dissenting

as well as to their security. Nevertheless, it does not
appear to be the case that the ability to own a handgun, or
any particular type of firearm, is critical to leading a life of
autonomy, dignity, or political equality: The marketplace
offers many tools for self-defense, even if they are imper­
fect substitutes, and neither petitioners nor their amici
make such a contention. Petitioners’ claim is not the kind
of substantive interest, accordingly, on which a uniform,
judicially enforced national standard is presumptively
appropriate.36
   Indeed, in some respects the substantive right at issue
may be better viewed as a property right. Petitioners wish
to acquire certain types of firearms, or to keep certain
firearms they have previously acquired. Interests in the
possession of chattels have traditionally been viewed as
property interests subject to definition and regulation by
the States. Cf. Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. v.

ally speaking, state law defines property interests”).

such messy considerations as how an interest actually affects people’s
lives. Ante, at 10. Both the constitutional text and our cases use the
term “liberty,” however, and liberty is not a purely objective concept.
Substantive due process analysis does not require any “political”
judgment, ibid. It does require some amount of practical and norma­
tive judgment. The only way to assess what is essential to fulfilling the
Constitution’s guarantee of “liberty,” in the present day, is to provide
reasons that apply to the present day. I have provided many; JUSTICE
SCALIA and the Court have provided virtually none.
   JUSTICE SCALIA also misstates my argument when he refers to “the
right to keep and bear arms,” without qualification. Ante, at 9. That is
what the Second Amendment protects against Federal Government
infringement. I have taken pains to show why the Fourteenth Amend­
ment liberty interest asserted by petitioners—the interest in keeping a
firearm of one’s choosing in the home—is not necessarily coextensive
with the Second Amendment right.

Under that tradition, Chicago’s ordinance is unexcep­
tional.37
   The liberty interest asserted by petitioners is also dis­
similar from those we have recognized in its capacity to
undermine the security of others. To be sure, some of the
Bill of Rights’ procedural guarantees may place “restric­
tions on law enforcement” that have “controversial public
safety implications.” Ante, at 36 (plurality opinion); see
also ante, at 9 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). But those implica­
tions are generally quite attenuated. A defendant’s invo­
cation of his right to remain silent, to confront a witness,
or to exclude certain evidence cannot directly cause any
threat. The defendant’s liberty interest is constrained by
(and is itself a constraint on) the adjudicatory process.
The link between handgun ownership and public safety is
much tighter. The handgun is itself a tool for crime; the
handgun’s bullets are the violence.
   Similarly, it is undeniable that some may take profound
offense at a remark made by the soapbox speaker, the
practices of another religion, or a gay couple’s choice to
have intimate relations. But that offense is moral, psycho­
logical, or theological in nature; the actions taken by the

   37 It has not escaped my attention that the Due Process Clause refers

to “property” as well as “liberty.” Cf. ante, at 2, n. 1, 9–10, n. 6 (opinion
of SCALIA, J.). Indeed, in Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977)
(plurality opinion), I alone viewed “the critical question” as “whether
East Cleveland’s housing ordinance [was] a permissible restriction on
appellant’s right to use her own property as she sees fit,” id., at 513
(opinion concurring in judgment). In that case, unlike in this case, the
asserted property right was coextensive with a right to organize one’s
family life, and I could find “no precedent” for the ordinance at issue,
which “exclude[d] any of an owner’s relatives from the group of persons
who may occupy his residence on a permanent basis.” Id., at 520. I am
open to property claims under the Fourteenth Amendment. This case
just involves a weak one. And ever since the Court “incorporated” the
more specific property protections of the Takings Clause in 1897, see
Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co., 166 U. S. 226, substantive due process doctrine
has focused on liberty.

rights-bearers do not actually threaten the physical safety
of any other person.38 Firearms may be used to kill an­
other person. If a legislature’s response to dangerous
weapons ends up impinging upon the liberty of any indi­
viduals in pursuit of the greater good, it invariably does so
on the basis of more than the majority’s “ ‘own moral
code,’ ” Lawrence, 539 U. S., at 571 (quoting Casey, 505
U. S., at 850). While specific policies may of course be
misguided, gun control is an area in which it “is quite
wrong . . . to assume that regulation and liberty occupy
mutually exclusive zones—that as one expands, the other
must contract.” Stevens, 41 U. Miami L. Rev., at 280.
   Third, the experience of other advanced democracies,
including those that share our British heritage, undercuts
the notion that an expansive right to keep and bear arms
is intrinsic to ordered liberty. Many of these countries
place restrictions on the possession, use, and carriage of
firearms far more onerous than the restrictions found in
this Nation. See Municipal Respondents’ Brief 21–23
(discussing laws of England, Canada, Australia, Japan,
Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, and New Zealand). That
the United States is an international outlier in the per­
missiveness of its approach to guns does not suggest that
our laws are bad laws. It does suggest that this Court
may not need to assume responsibility for making our
laws still more permissive.
   Admittedly, these other countries differ from ours in
many relevant respects, including their problems with
violent crime and the traditional role that firearms have
played in their societies. But they are not so different
from the United States that we ought to dismiss their
experience entirely. Cf. ante, at 34–35 (plurality opinion);
ante, at 10–11 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The fact that our

oldest allies have almost uniformly found it appropriate to
regulate firearms extensively tends to weaken petitioners’
submission that the right to possess a gun of one’s choos­
ing is fundamental to a life of liberty. While the “Ameri­
can perspective” must always be our focus, ante, at 37, 44
(plurality opinion), it is silly—indeed, arrogant—to think
we have nothing to learn about liberty from the billions of
people beyond our borders.
   Fourth, the Second Amendment differs in kind from the
Amendments that surround it, with the consequence that
its inclusion in the Bill of Rights is not merely unhelpful
but positively harmful to petitioners’ claim. Generally, the
inclusion of a liberty interest in the Bill of Rights points
toward the conclusion that it is of fundamental significance
and ought to be enforceable against the States. But the
Second Amendment plays a peculiar role within the Bill, as
announced by its peculiar opening clause.39 Even accept­
ing the Heller Court’s view that the Amendment protects
an individual right to keep and bear arms disconnected
from militia service, it remains undeniable that “the pur­
pose for which the right was codified” was “to prevent
elimination of the militia.” Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 26); see also United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174,
178 (1939) (Second Amendment was enacted “[w]ith obvi­
ous purpose to assure the continuation and render possible
the effectiveness of [militia] forces”). It was the States, not
private persons, on whose immediate behalf the Second
Amendment was adopted. Notwithstanding the Heller
Court’s efforts to write the Second Amendment’s preamble
out of the Constitution, the Amendment still serves the
structural function of protecting the States from en­
croachment by an overreaching Federal Government.
——————
  39 The Second Amendment provides: “A well regulated Militia, being

necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep
and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”
42                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                         STEVENS, J., dissenting

   The Second Amendment, in other words, “is a federal­
ism provision,” Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow,
542 U. S. 1, 45 (2004) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judg­
ment). It is directed at preserving the autonomy of the
sovereign States, and its logic therefore “resists” incorpo­
ration by a federal court against the States. Ibid. No one
suggests that the Tenth Amendment, which provides that
powers not given to the Federal Government remain with
“the States,” applies to the States; such a reading would
border on incoherent, given that the Tenth Amendment
exists (in significant part) to safeguard the vitality of state
governance. The Second Amendment is no different.40
   The Court is surely correct that Americans’ conceptions
of the Second Amendment right evolved over time in a
more individualistic direction; that Members of the Recon­
struction Congress were urgently concerned about the
safety of the newly freed slaves; and that some Members
believed that, following ratification of the Fourteenth
Amendment, the Second Amendment would apply to the
States. But it is a giant leap from these data points to the
conclusion that the Fourteenth Amendment “incorporated”
the Second Amendment as a matter of original meaning or
postenactment interpretation. Consider, for example, that
the text of the Fourteenth Amendment says nothing about
the Second Amendment or firearms; that there is substan­
tial evidence to suggest that, when the Reconstruction
Congress enacted measures to ensure newly freed slaves

   40 Contrary to JUSTICE SCALIA’s suggestion, this point is perfectly

compatible with my opinion for the Court in Elk Grove Unified School
Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1 (2004). Cf. ante, at 11. Like the Court
itself, I have never agreed with JUSTICE THOMAS’ view that the Estab­
lishment Clause is a federalism provision. But I agree with his under­
lying logic: If a clause in the Bill of Rights exists to safeguard federal­
ism interests, then it makes little sense to “incorporate” it. JUSTICE
SCALIA’s further suggestion that I ought to have revisited the Estab­
lishment Clause debate in this opinion, ibid., is simply bizarre.

and Union sympathizers in the South enjoyed the right to
possess firearms, it was motivated by antidiscrimination
and equality concerns rather than arms-bearing concerns
per se;41 that many contemporaneous courts and commen­
tators did not understand the Fourteenth Amendment to
have had an “incorporating” effect; and that the States
heavily regulated the right to keep and bear arms both
before and after the Amendment’s passage. The Court’s
narrative largely elides these facts. The complications
they raise show why even the most dogged historical
inquiry into the “fundamentality” of the Second Amend­
ment right (or any other) necessarily entails judicial
judgment—and therefore judicial discretion—every step of
the way.
  I accept that the evolution in Americans’ understanding
of the Second Amendment may help shed light on the
question whether a right to keep and bear arms is com­
prised within Fourteenth Amendment “liberty.” But the
reasons that motivated the Framers to protect the ability
of militiamen to keep muskets available for military use
when our Nation was in its infancy, or that motivated the
Reconstruction Congress to extend full citizenship to the
freedmen in the wake of the Civil War, have only a limited
bearing on the question that confronts the homeowner in a
crime-infested metropolis today. The many episodes of

the Reconstruction-era evidence shows the right to bear arms was
regarded as “a substantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be
ignored so long as the States legislated in an evenhanded manner.”
Ante, at 33. That may be so, but it does not resolve the question
whether the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause was origi­
nally understood to encompass a right to keep and bear arms, or
whether it ought to be so construed now.

Nation’s history, see ante, at 23–29 (majority opinion);
ante, at 41–44, 53–55 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment), do not suggest that every Ameri­
can must be allowed to own whatever type of firearm he or
she desires—just that no group of Americans should be
systematically and discriminatorily disarmed and left to
the mercy of racial terrorists. And the fact that some
Americans may have thought or hoped that the Four­
teenth Amendment would nationalize the Second Amend­
ment hardly suffices to justify the conclusion that it did.
   Fifth, although it may be true that Americans’ interest
in firearm possession and state-law recognition of that
interest are “deeply rooted” in some important senses,
ante, at 19 (internal quotation marks omitted), it is
equally true that the States have a long and unbroken
history of regulating firearms. The idea that States may
place substantial restrictions on the right to keep and bear
arms short of complete disarmament is, in fact, far more
entrenched than the notion that the Federal Constitution
protects any such right. Federalism is a far “older and
more deeply rooted tradition than is a right to carry,” or to
own, “any particular kind of weapon.” 567 F. 3d 856, 860
(CA7 2009) (Easterbrook, C. J.).
   From the early days of the Republic, through the Recon­
struction era, to the present day, States and municipali­
ties have placed extensive licensing requirements on
firearm acquisition, restricted the public carriage of weap­
ons, and banned altogether the possession of especially
dangerous weapons, including handguns. See Heller, 554

almost uniformly upheld these measures: Apart from
making clear that all regulations had to be constructed
and applied in a nondiscriminatory manner, the Four­
teenth Amendment hardly made a dent. And let us not
forget that this Court did not recognize any non-militia­
related interests under the Second Amendment until two
Terms ago, in Heller. Petitioners do not dispute the city of
Chicago’s observation that “[n]o other substantive Bill of
Rights protection has been regulated nearly as intru­
sively” as the right to keep and bear arms. Municipal
Respondents’ Brief 25.43

out for regulation,44 and the ability to respond to the social

  42 I  am unclear what the plurality means when it refers to “the pau­
city of precedent sustaining bans comparable to those at issue here.”
Ante, at 39. There is only one ban at issue here—the city of Chicago’s
handgun prohibition—and the municipal respondents cite far more
than “one case,” ibid., from the post-Reconstruction period. See Mu­
nicipal Respondents’ Brief 24–30. The evidence adduced by respon­
dents and their amici easily establishes their contentions that the
“consensus in States that recognize a firearms right is that arms
possession, even in the home, is . . . subject to interest-balancing,” id.,
at 24; and that the practice of “[b]anning weapons routinely used for
self-defense,” when deemed “necessary for the public welfare,” “has
ample historical pedigree,” id., at 28. Petitioners do not even try to
challenge these contentions.
   43 I agree with JUSTICE SCALIA that a history of regulation hardly

proves a right is not “of fundamental character.” Ante, at 12. An
unbroken history of extremely intensive, carefully considered regula­
tion does, however, tend to suggest that it is not.
   44 The Heller majority asserted that “the adjective ‘well-regulated’ ” in

the Second Amendment’s preamble “implies nothing more than the
imposition of proper discipline and training.” 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,

ills associated with dangerous weapons goes to the very
core of the States’ police powers. Our precedent is crystal­
clear on this latter point. See, e.g., Gonzales v. Oregon,
546 U. S. 243, 270 (2006) (“[T]he structure and limitations
of federalism . . . allow the States great latitude under
their police powers to legislate as to the protection of the
lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons”
(internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v.
Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 618 (2000) (“[W]e can think of no
better example of the police power, which the Founders
denied the National Government and reposed in the
States, than the suppression of violent crime and vindica­
tion of its victims”); Kelley v. Johnson, 425 U. S. 238, 247

regulation”). But even if the assertion were correct, the point would
remain that the preamble envisions an active state role in overseeing
how the right to keep and bear arms is utilized, and in ensuring that it
is channeled toward productive ends.

so heavy a toll in terms of state sovereignty.
   Finally, even apart from the States’ long history of
firearms regulation and its location at the core of their
police powers, this is a quintessential area in which feder­
alism ought to be allowed to flourish without this Court’s
meddling. Whether or not we can assert a plausible con­
stitutional basis for intervening, there are powerful rea­
sons why we should not do so.
   Across the Nation, States and localities vary signifi­
cantly in the patterns and problems of gun violence they
face, as well as in the traditions and cultures of lawful gun
use they claim. Cf. post, at 16–17. The city of Chicago, for
example, faces a pressing challenge in combating criminal
street gangs. Most rural areas do not. The city of Chicago
has a high population density, which increases the poten­
tial for a gunman to inflict mass terror and casualties.
Most rural areas do not.45 The city of Chicago offers little
in the way of hunting opportunities. Residents of rural
communities are, one presumes, much more likely to stock
the dinner table with game they have personally felled.
   Given that relevant background conditions diverge so
much across jurisdictions, the Court ought to pay particu­
lar heed to state and local legislatures’ “right to experi­
ment.” New State Ice, 285 U. S., at 311 (Brandeis, J.,
dissenting). So long as the regulatory measures they have
chosen are not “arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable,” we
should be allowing them to “try novel social and economic”
policies. Ibid. It “is more in keeping . . . with our status
as a court in a federal system,” under these circumstances,
“to avoid imposing a single solution . . . from the top
down.” Smith v. Robbins, 528 U. S. 259, 275 (2000).

  45 Cf. Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19) (BREYER, J., dissenting)

and property crimes occur in urban areas, and urban criminals are
more likely than other offenders to use a firearm during the commis­
sion of a violent crime”).

   It is all the more unwise for this Court to limit experi­
mentation in an area “where the best solution is far from
clear.” United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 581 (1995)
(KENNEDY, J., concurring). Few issues of public policy are
subject to such intensive and rapidly developing empirical
controversy as gun control. See Heller, 554 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 20–25) (BREYER, J., dissenting). Chicago’s
handgun ban, in itself, has divided researchers. Compare
Brief for Professors of Criminal Justice as Amici Curiae
(arguing that ordinance has been effective at reducing gun
violence), with Brief for International Law Enforcement
Educators and Trainers Association et al. as Amici Curiae
17–26 (arguing that ordinance has been a failure).46 Of
course, on some matters the Constitution requires that we
ignore such pragmatic considerations. But the Constitu­
tion’s text, history, and structure are not so clear on the
matter before us—as evidenced by the groundbreaking
nature of today’s fractured decision—and this Court lacks
both the technical capacity and the localized expertise to
assess “the wisdom, need, and propriety” of most gun­
control measures. Griswold, 381 U. S., at 482.47
——————
  46 The fact that Chicago’s handgun murder rate may have “actually

increased since the ban was enacted,” ante, at 2 (majority opinion),
means virtually nothing in itself. Countless factors unrelated to the
policy may have contributed to that trend. Without a sophisticated
regression analysis, we cannot even begin to speculate as to the efficacy
or effects of the handgun ban. Even with such an analysis, we could
never be certain as to the determinants of the city’s murder rate.
  47 In some sense, it is no doubt true that the “best” solution is elusive

for many “serious social problems.” Ante, at 12 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).
Yet few social problems have raised such heated empirical controversy
as the problem of gun violence. And few, if any, of the liberty interests
we have recognized under the Due Process Clause have raised as many
complications for judicial oversight as the interest that is recognized
today. See post, at 11–16.
  I agree with the plurality that for a right to be eligible for substantive
due process recognition, there need not be “a ‘popular consensus’ that
the right is fundamental.” Ante, at 42. In our remarkably diverse,

  Nor will the Court’s intervention bring any clarity to
this enormously complex area of law. Quite to the con­
trary, today’s decision invites an avalanche of litigation
that could mire the federal courts in fine-grained determi­
nations about which state and local regulations comport
with the Heller right—the precise contours of which are
far from pellucid—under a standard of review we have not
even established. See post, at 12–15. The plurality’s
“assuranc[e]” that “incorporation does not imperil every
law regulating firearms,” ante, at 40, provides only modest
comfort. For it is also an admission of just how many
different types of regulations are potentially implicated by
today’s ruling, and of just how ad hoc the Court’s initial
attempt to draw distinctions among them was in Heller.
The practical significance of the proposition that “the
Second Amendment right is fully applicable to the States,”
ante, at 1 (majority opinion), remains to be worked out by
this Court over many, many years.
  Furthermore, and critically, the Court’s imposition of a
national standard is still more unwise because the elected
branches have shown themselves to be perfectly capable of
safeguarding the interest in keeping and bearing arms.
The strength of a liberty claim must be assessed in con­
nection with its status in the democratic process. And in
this case, no one disputes “that opponents of [gun] control
have considerable political power and do not seem to be at
a systematic disadvantage in the democratic process,” or
that “the widespread commitment to an individual right to
own guns . . . operates as a safeguard against excessive or

pluralistic society, there will almost never be such uniformity of opin­
ion. But to the extent that popular consensus is relevant, I do not agree
with the Court that the amicus brief filed in this case by numerous
state attorneys general constitutes evidence thereof. Ante, at 42–43. It
is puzzling that so many state lawmakers have asked us to limit their
option to regulate a dangerous item. Cf. post, at 9–10.

Amendment Minimalism: Heller as Griswold, 122 Harv.
L. Rev. 246, 260 (2008). Indeed, there is a good deal of
evidence to suggest that, if anything, American lawmakers
tend to underregulate guns, relative to the policy views
expressed by majorities in opinion polls. See K. Goss,
Disarmed: The Missing Movement for Gun Control in
America 6 (2006). If a particular State or locality has
enacted some “improvident” gun-control measures, as
petitioners believe Chicago has done, there is no apparent
reason to infer that the mistake will not “eventually be
rectified by the democratic process.” Vance v. Bradley, 440
U. S. 93, 97 (1979).
   This is not a case, then, that involves a “special condi­
tion” that “may call for a correspondingly more searching
judicial inquiry.” Carolene Products, 304 U. S., at 153,
n. 4. Neither petitioners nor those most zealously commit­
ted to their views represent a group or a claim that is
liable to receive unfair treatment at the hands of the
majority. On the contrary, petitioners’ views are sup­
ported by powerful participants in the legislative process.
Petitioners have given us no reason to believe that the
interest in keeping and bearing arms entails any special
need for judicial lawmaking, or that federal judges are
more qualified to craft appropriate rules than the people’s
elected representatives. Having failed to show why their
asserted interest is intrinsic to the concept of ordered
liberty or vulnerable to maltreatment in the political
arena, they have failed to show why “the word liberty in
the Fourteenth Amendment” should be “held to prevent
the natural outcome of a dominant opinion” about how to

  The preceding sections have already addressed many of
the points made by JUSTICE SCALIA in his concurrence.
But in light of that opinion’s fixation on this one, it is
appropriate to say a few words about JUSTICE SCALIA’s
broader claim: that his preferred method of substantive
due process analysis, a method “that makes the traditions
of our people paramount,” ante, at 1, is both more re­
strained and more facilitative of democracy than the
method I have outlined. Colorful as it is, JUSTICE SCALIA’s
critique does not have nearly as much force as does his
rhetoric. His theory of substantive due process, moreover,
comes with its own profound difficulties.
  Although JUSTICE SCALIA aspires to an “objective,”
“neutral” method of substantive due process analysis,
ante, at 10, his actual method is nothing of the sort. Un­
der the “historically focused” approach he advocates, ante,
at 13, numerous threshold questions arise before one ever
gets to the history. At what level of generality should one
frame the liberty interest in question? See n. 25, supra.
What does it mean for a right to be “ ‘deeply rooted in this
Nation’s history and tradition,’ ” ante, at 3 (quoting
Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721)? By what standard will
that proposition be tested? Which types of sources will
count, and how will those sources be weighed and aggre­
gated? There is no objective, neutral answer to these
questions. There is not even a theory—at least, JUSTICE
SCALIA provides none—of how to go about answering
them.
  Nor is there any escaping Palko, it seems. To qualify for
substantive due process protection, JUSTICE SCALIA has
stated, an asserted liberty right must be not only deeply
52                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                         STEVENS, J., dissenting

rooted in American tradition, “but it must also be implicit
in the concept of ordered liberty.” Lawrence, 539 U. S., at
593, n. 3 (dissenting opinion) (internal quotation marks
omitted). Applying the latter, Palko-derived half of that
test requires precisely the sort of reasoned judgment—the
same multifaceted evaluation of the right’s contours and
consequences—that JUSTICE SCALIA mocks in his concur­
rence today.
   So does applying the first half. It is hardly a novel
insight that history is not an objective science, and that its
use can therefore “point in any direction the judges favor,”
ante, at 14 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Yet 21 years after the
point was brought to his attention by Justice Brennan,
JUSTICE SCALIA remains “oblivious to the fact that [the
concept of ‘tradition’] can be as malleable and elusive as
‘liberty’ itself.” Michael H., 491 U. S., at 137 (dissenting
opinion). Even when historical analysis is focused on a
discrete proposition, such as the original public meaning of
the Second Amendment, the evidence often points in
different directions. The historian must choose which
pieces to credit and which to discount, and then must try
to assemble them into a coherent whole. In Heller,
JUSTICE SCALIA preferred to rely on sources created much
earlier and later in time than the Second Amendment
itself, see, e.g., 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4–5) (consult­
ing late 19th-century treatises to ascertain how Americans
would have read the Amendment’s preamble in 1791); I
focused more closely on sources contemporaneous with the
Amendment’s drafting and ratification.49 No mechanical

Amendment, the Court dwells at length on four other sources: the 17th­
century English Bill of Rights; Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws

and post-Civil War legislative history”); see also post, at 2–5 (discussing

yardstick can measure which of us was correct, either with
respect to the materials we chose to privilege or the in­
sights we gleaned from them.
   The malleability and elusiveness of history increase
exponentially when we move from a pure question of
original meaning, as in Heller, to JUSTICE SCALIA’s theory
of substantive due process. At least with the former sort
of question, the judge can focus on a single legal provision;
the temporal scope of the inquiry is (or should be) rela­
tively bounded; and there is substantial agreement on
what sorts of authorities merit consideration.          With
JUSTICE SCALIA’s approach to substantive due process,
these guideposts all fall away. The judge must canvas the
entire landscape of American law as it has evolved
through time, and perhaps older laws as well, see, e.g.,
Lawrence, 539 U. S., at 596 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (dis­
cussing “ ‘ancient roots’ ” of proscriptions against sodomy
(quoting Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186, 192 (1986)),
pursuant to a standard (deeply rootedness) that has never
been defined. In conducting this rudderless, panoramic
tour of American legal history, the judge has more than
ample opportunity to “look over the heads of the crowd
and pick out [his] friends,” Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S.
551, 617 (2005) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).
   My point is not to criticize judges’ use of history in
general or to suggest that it always generates indetermi­
nate answers; I have already emphasized that historical
study can discipline as well as enrich substantive due
process analysis.     My point is simply that JUSTICE
SCALIA’s defense of his method, which holds out objectivity
and restraint as its cardinal—and, it seems, only—virtues,
is unsatisfying on its own terms. For a limitless number
of subjective judgments may be smuggled into his histori­
cal analysis. Worse, they may be buried in the analysis.
At least with my approach, the judge’s cards are laid on
the table for all to see, and to critique. The judge must
54                       MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

exercise judgment, to be sure. When answering a consti­
tutional question to which the text provides no clear an­
swer, there is always some amount of discretion; our
constitutional system has always depended on judges’
filling in the document’s vast open spaces.50 But there is
also transparency.
   JUSTICE SCALIA’s approach is even less restrained in
another sense: It would effect a major break from our case
law outside of the “incorporation” area. JUSTICE SCALIA
does not seem troubled by the fact that his method is
largely inconsistent with the Court’s canonical substantive
due process decisions, ranging from Meyer, 262 U. S. 390,
and Pierce, 268 U. S. 510, in the 1920’s, to Griswold, 381
U. S. 479, in the 1960’s, to Lawrence, 539 U. S. 558, in the
2000’s. To the contrary, he seems to embrace this disso­
nance. My method seeks to synthesize dozens of cases on
which the American people have relied for decades.
JUSTICE SCALIA’s method seeks to vaporize them. So I am
left to wonder, which of us is more faithful to this Nation’s
constitutional history? And which of us is more faithful to
the values and commitments of the American people, as
they stand today? In 1967, when the Court held in Lov­
ing, 388 U. S. 1, that adults have a liberty-based as well as
equality-based right to wed persons of another race, inter­
racial marriage was hardly “deeply rooted” in American
tradition. Racial segregation and subordination were
deeply rooted. The Court’s substantive due process hold­
ing was nonetheless correct—and we should be wary of
any interpretive theory that implies, emphatically, that it
was not.
   Which leads me to the final set of points I wish to make:
JUSTICE SCALIA’s method invites not only bad history, but
also bad constitutional law. As I have already explained,
in evaluating a claimed liberty interest (or any constitu­

                     STEVENS, J., dissenting

tional claim for that matter), it makes perfect sense to give
history significant weight: JUSTICE SCALIA’s position is
closer to my own than he apparently feels comfortable
acknowledging. But it makes little sense to give history
dispositive weight in every case. And it makes especially
little sense to answer questions like whether the right to
bear arms is “fundamental” by focusing only on the past,
given that both the practical significance and the public
understandings of such a right often change as society
changes. What if the evidence had shown that, whereas at
one time firearm possession contributed substantially to
personal liberty and safety, nowadays it contributes noth­
ing, or even tends to undermine them? Would it still have
been reasonable to constitutionalize the right?
   The concern runs still deeper. Not only can historical
views be less than completely clear or informative, but
they can also be wrong. Some notions that many Ameri­
cans deeply believed to be true, at one time, turned out not
to be true. Some practices that many Americans believed
to be consistent with the Constitution’s guarantees of
liberty and equality, at one time, turned out to be incon­
sistent with them. The fact that we have a written Con­
stitution does not consign this Nation to a static legal
existence. Although we should always “pa[y] a decent
regard to the opinions of former times,” it “is not the glory
of the people of America” to have “suffered a blind venera­
tion for antiquity.” The Federalist No. 14, p. 99, 104 (C.
Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). It is not the role of federal
judges to be amateur historians. And it is not fidelity to
the Constitution to ignore its use of deliberately capacious
language, in an effort to transform foundational legal
commitments into narrow rules of decision.
   As for “the democratic process,” ante, at 14, 15, a
method that looks exclusively to history can easily do more
harm than good. Just consider this case. The net result of
JUSTICE SCALIA’s supposedly objective analysis is to vest
56                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                    STEVENS, J., dissenting

federal judges—ultimately a majority of the judges on this
Court—with unprecedented lawmaking powers in an area
in which they have no special qualifications, and in which
the give-and-take of the political process has functioned
effectively for decades. Why this “intrudes much less upon
the democratic process,” ante, at 14, than an approach
that would defer to the democratic process on the regula­
tion of firearms is, to say the least, not self-evident. I
cannot even tell what, under JUSTICE SCALIA’s view, con­
stitutes an “intrusion.”
   It is worth pondering, furthermore, the vision of democ­
racy that underlies JUSTICE SCALIA’s critique. Because
very few of us would welcome a system in which majorities
or powerful interest groups always get their way. Under
our constitutional scheme, I would have thought that a
judicial approach to liberty claims such as the one I have
outlined—an approach that investigates both the intrinsic
nature of the claimed interest and the practical signifi­
cance of its judicial enforcement, that is transparent in its
reasoning and sincere in its effort to incorporate con­
straints, that is guided by history but not beholden to it,
and that is willing to protect some rights even if they have
not already received uniform protection from the elected
branches—has the capacity to improve, rather than
“[im]peril,” ante, at 15, our democracy. It all depends on
judges’ exercising careful, reasoned judgment. As it al­
ways has, and as it always will.
                             VII
  The fact that the right to keep and bear arms appears in
the Constitution should not obscure the novelty of the
Court’s decision to enforce that right against the States.
By its terms, the Second Amendment does not apply to the
States; read properly, it does not even apply to individuals
outside of the militia context. The Second Amendment
was adopted to protect the States from federal encroach­

                    STEVENS, J., dissenting

ment. And the Fourteenth Amendment has never been
understood by the Court to have “incorporated” the entire
Bill of Rights. There was nothing foreordained about
today’s outcome.
   Although the Court’s decision in this case might be seen
as a mere adjunct to its decision in Heller, the conse­
quences could prove far more destructive—quite liter­
ally—to our Nation’s communities and to our constitu­
tional structure. Thankfully, the Second Amendment
right identified in Heller and its newly minted Fourteenth
Amendment analogue are limited, at least for now, to the
home. But neither the “assurances” provided by the plu­
rality, ante, at 40, nor the many historical sources cited in
its opinion should obscure the reality that today’s ruling
marks a dramatic change in our law—or that the Justices
who have joined it have brought to bear an awesome
amount of discretion in resolving the legal question pre­
sented by this case.
   I would proceed more cautiously. For the reasons set
out at length above, I cannot accept either the methodol­
ogy the Court employs or the conclusions it draws. Al­
though impressively argued, the majority’s decision to
overturn more than a century of Supreme Court precedent
and to unsettle a much longer tradition of state practice is
not, in my judgment, built “upon respect for the teachings
of history, solid recognition of the basic values that under­
lie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles
that the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers
have played in establishing and preserving American
freedoms.” Griswold, 381 U. S., at 501 (Harlan, J., con­
curring in judgment).
   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

 OTIS MCDONALD, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. CITY OF 

          CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, ET AL. 

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

                        [June 28, 2010] 


  JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG and
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, dissenting.
  In my view, JUSTICE STEVENS has demonstrated that
the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of “substantive
due process” does not include a general right to keep and
bear firearms for purposes of private self-defense. As he
argues, the Framers did not write the Second Amendment
with this objective in view. See ante, at 41–44 (dissenting
opinion). Unlike other forms of substantive liberty, the
carrying of arms for that purpose often puts others’ lives
at risk. See ante, at 35–37. And the use of arms for pri
vate self-defense does not warrant federal constitutional
protection from state regulation. See ante, at 44–51.
  The Court, however, does not expressly rest its opinion
upon “substantive due process” concerns. Rather, it di
rects its attention to this Court’s “incorporation” prece
dents and asks whether the Second Amendment right to
private self-defense is “fundamental” so that it applies to
the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. See ante,
at 11–19.
  I shall therefore separately consider the question of
“incorporation.” I can find nothing in the Second Amend
ment’s text, history, or underlying rationale that could
warrant characterizing it as “fundamental” insofar as it
seeks to protect the keeping and bearing of arms for pri
2                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

vate self-defense purposes. Nor can I find any justification
for interpreting the Constitution as transferring ultimate
regulatory authority over the private uses of firearms from
democratically elected legislatures to courts or from the
States to the Federal Government. I therefore conclude
that the Fourteenth Amendment does not “incorporate”
the Second Amendment’s right “to keep and bear Arms.”
And I consequently dissent.
                               I
    The Second Amendment says: “A well regulated Militia,
being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of
the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”
Two years ago, in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S.
___ (2008), the Court rejected the pre-existing judicial
consensus that the Second Amendment was primarily
concerned with the need to maintain a “well regulated
Militia.” See id., at ___ (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op.,
at 2–3, and n. 2, 38–45); United States v. Miller, 307 U. S.
174, 178 (1939). Although the Court acknowledged that
“the threat that the new Federal Government would de
stroy the citizens’ militia by taking away their arms was
the reason that right . . . was codified in a written Consti
tution,” the Court asserted that “individual self defense
. . . was the central component of the right itself.” Heller,
supra, at ___ (slip op., at 26) (first emphasis added). The
Court went on to hold that the Second Amendment re
stricted Congress’ power to regulate handguns used for
self-defense, and the Court found unconstitutional the
District of Columbia’s ban on the possession of handguns
in the home. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 64).
    The Court based its conclusions almost exclusively upon
its reading of history. But the relevant history in Heller
was far from clear: Four dissenting Justices disagreed
with the majority’s historical analysis. And subsequent
scholarly writing reveals why disputed history provides

                    BREYER, J., dissenting

treacherous ground on which to build decisions written by
judges who are not expert at history.
   Since Heller, historians, scholars, and judges have con
tinued to express the view that the Court’s historical
account was flawed. See, e.g., Konig, Why the Second
Amendment Has a Preamble: Original Public Meaning
and the Political Culture of Written Constitutions in
Revolutionary America, 56 UCLA L. Rev. 1295 (2009);

Second Amendment, and Originalist Methodology, 103

ness: The Supreme Court and Gun Control, New Republic,

Interpretation of the Second Amendment: Why Heller is
(Probably) Wrong on Originalist Grounds, 59 Syracuse
L. Rev. 171 (2008).
   Consider as an example of these critiques an amici brief
filed in this case by historians who specialize in the study
of the English Civil Wars. They tell us that Heller misun
derstood a key historical point. See Brief for Eng
lish/Early American Historians as Amici Curiae (hereinaf
ter English Historians’ Brief) (filed by 21 professors at
leading universities in the United States, United King
dom, and Australia). Heller’s conclusion that “individual
self-defense” was “the central component” of the Second
Amendment’s right “to keep and bear Arms” rested upon
its view that the Amendment “codified a pre-existing right”
that had “nothing whatever to do with service in a mili
4                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

tia.” 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26, 19–20). That view in
turn rested in significant part upon Blackstone having
described the right as “ ‘the right of having and using arms
for self-preservation and defence,’ ” which reflected the
provision in the English Declaration of Right of 1689 that
gave the King’s Protestant “ ‘subjects’ ” the right to “ ‘have
Arms for their defence suitable to their Conditions, and as
allowed by law.’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 19–20) (quoting 1
W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 140
(1765) (hereinafter Blackstone) and 1 W. &amp; M., c. 2, §7, in
3 Eng. Stat. at Large 441 (1689)). The Framers, said the
majority, understood that right “as permitting a citizen to
‘repe[l] force by force’ when ‘the intervention of society in
his behalf, may be too late to prevent an injury.’ ” 554
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21) (quoting St. George Tucker, 1
Blackstone’s Commentaries 145–146, n. 42 (1803)).
   The historians now tell us, however, that the right to
which Blackstone referred had, not nothing, but every
thing, to do with the militia. As properly understood at
the time of the English Civil Wars, the historians claim,
the right to bear arms “ensured that Parliament had the
power” to arm the citizenry: “to defend the realm” in the
case of a foreign enemy, and to “secure the right of ‘self
preservation,’ ” or “self-defense,” should “the sovereign
usurp the English Constitution.” English Historians’ Brief
3, 8–13, 23–24 (emphasis added). Thus, the Declaration of
Right says that private persons can possess guns only “as
allowed by law.” See id., at 20–24. Moreover, when
Blackstone referred to “ ‘the right of having and using
arms for self-preservation and defence,’ ” he was referring
to the right of the people “to take part in the militia to
defend their political liberties,” and to the right of Parlia
ment (which represented the people) to raise a militia even
when the King sought to deny it that power. Id., at 4, 24–
27 (emphasis added) (quoting 1 Blackstone 140). Nor can
the historians find any convincing reason to believe that
                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            5

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

the Framers had something different in mind than what
Blackstone himself meant. Compare Heller, supra, at ___
(slip op., at 21–22) with English Historians’ Brief 28–40.
The historians concede that at least one historian takes a
different position, see id., at 7, but the Court, they imply,
would lose a poll taken among professional historians of
this period, say, by a vote of 8 to 1.
   If history, and history alone, is what matters, why
would the Court not now reconsider Heller in light of these
more recently published historical views? See Leegin
Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U. S.
877, 923–924 (2007) (BREYER, J., dissenting) (noting that
stare decisis interests are at their lowest with respect to
recent and erroneous constitutional decisions that create
unworkable legal regimes); Citizens United v. Federal
Election Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 47)
(listing similar factors); see also Wallace v. Jaffree, 472
U. S. 38, 99 (1985) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (“[S]tare
decisis may bind courts as to matters of law, but it cannot
bind them as to matters of history”). At the least, where
Heller’s historical foundations are so uncertain, why ex
tend its applicability?
   My aim in referring to this history is to illustrate the
reefs and shoals that lie in wait for those nonexpert judges
who place virtually determinative weight upon historical
considerations. In my own view, the Court should not look
to history alone but to other factors as well—above all, in
cases where the history is so unclear that the experts
themselves strongly disagree. It should, for example,
consider the basic values that underlie a constitutional
provision and their contemporary significance. And it
should examine as well the relevant consequences and
practical justifications that might, or might not, warrant
removing an important question from the democratic
decisionmaking process. See ante, at 16–20 (STEVENS, J.,
dissenting) (discussing shortcomings of an exclusively
6                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                    BREYER, J., dissenting

historical approach).
                              II 

                              A

   In my view, taking Heller as a given, the Fourteenth
Amendment does not incorporate the Second Amendment
right to keep and bear arms for purposes of private self
defense. Under this Court’s precedents, to incorporate the
private self-defense right the majority must show that the
right is, e.g., “fundamental to the American scheme of
justice,” Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149 (1968);
see ibid., n. 14; see also ante, at 44 (plurality opinion)
(finding that the right is “fundamental” and therefore
incorporated). And this it fails to do.
   The majority here, like that in Heller, relies almost
exclusively upon history to make the necessary showing.
Ante, at 20–33. But to do so for incorporation purposes is
both wrong and dangerous. As JUSTICE STEVENS points
out, our society has historically made mistakes—for ex
ample, when considering certain 18th- and 19th-century
property rights to be fundamental. Ante, at 19 (dissenting
opinion). And in the incorporation context, as elsewhere,
history often is unclear about the answers. See Part I,
supra; Part III, infra.
   Accordingly, this Court, in considering an incorporation
question, has never stated that the historical status of a
right is the only relevant consideration. Rather, the Court
has either explicitly or implicitly made clear in its opin
ions that the right in question has remained fundamental
over time. See, e.g., Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U. S. 404, 410
(1972) (plurality opinion) (stating that the incorporation
“inquiry must focus upon the function served” by the right
in question in “contemporary society” (emphasis added));
Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 154 (1968) (noting
that the right in question “continues to receive strong
support”); Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U. S. 213, 226
                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

(1967) (same). And, indeed, neither of the parties before
us in this case has asked us to employ the majority’s his
tory-constrained approach. See Brief for Petitioners 67–69
(arguing for incorporation based on trends in contempo
rary support for the right); Brief for Respondents City of
Chicago et al. 23–31 (hereinafter Municipal Respondents)
(looking to current state practices with respect to the
right).
   I thus think it proper, above all where history provides
no clear answer, to look to other factors in considering
whether a right is sufficiently “fundamental” to remove it
from the political process in every State. I would include
among those factors the nature of the right; any contem
porary disagreement about whether the right is funda
mental; the extent to which incorporation will further
other, perhaps more basic, constitutional aims; and the
extent to which incorporation will advance or hinder the
Constitution’s structural aims, including its division of
powers among different governmental institutions (and
the people as well). Is incorporation needed, for example,
to further the Constitution’s effort to ensure that the
government treats each individual with equal respect?
Will it help maintain the democratic form of government
that the Constitution foresees? In a word, will incorpora
tion prove consistent, or inconsistent, with the Constitu
tion’s efforts to create governmental institutions well
suited to the carrying out of its constitutional promises?
   Finally, I would take account of the Framers’ basic
reason for believing the Court ought to have the power of
judicial review. Alexander Hamilton feared granting that
power to Congress alone, for he feared that Congress,
acting as judges, would not overturn as unconstitutional a
popular statute that it had recently enacted, as legislators.
The Federalist No. 78, p. 405 (G. Carey &amp; J. McClellan
eds. 2001) (A. Hamilton) (“This independence of the judges
is equally requisite to guard the constitution and the
8                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                    BREYER, J., dissenting

rights of individuals from the effects of those ill humours,
which” can, at times, lead to “serious oppressions of the
minor part in the community”). Judges, he thought, may
find it easier to resist popular pressure to suppress the
basic rights of an unpopular minority. See United States
v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152, n. 4 (1938).
That being so, it makes sense to ask whether that particu
lar comparative judicial advantage is relevant to the case
at hand. See, e.g., J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust (1980).
                               B
   How do these considerations apply here? For one thing,
I would apply them only to the private self-defense right
directly at issue. After all, the Amendment’s militia
related purpose is primarily to protect States from federal
regulation, not to protect individuals from militia-related
regulation. Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26); see
also Miller, 307 U. S., at 178. Moreover, the Civil War
Amendments, the electoral process, the courts, and nu
merous other institutions today help to safeguard the
States and the people from any serious threat of federal
tyranny. How are state militias additionally necessary?
It is difficult to see how a right that, as the majority con
cedes, has “largely faded as a popular concern” could
possibly be so fundamental that it would warrant incorpo
ration through the Fourteenth Amendment. Ante, at 22.
Hence, the incorporation of the Second Amendment cannot
be based on the militia-related aspect of what Heller found
to be more extensive Second Amendment rights.
   For another thing, as Heller concedes, the private self
defense right that the Court would incorporate has noth
ing to do with “the reason” the Framers “codified” the right
to keep and bear arms “in a written Constitution.” 554
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26) (emphasis added). Heller
immediately adds that the self-defense right was nonethe
less “the central component of the right.” Ibid. In my

view, this is the historical equivalent of a claim that water
runs uphill. See Part I, supra. But, taking it as valid, the
Framers’ basic reasons for including language in the Con
stitution would nonetheless seem more pertinent (in decid
ing about the contemporary importance of a right) than
the particular scope 17th- or 18th-century listeners would
have then assigned to the words they used. And examina
tion of the Framers’ motivation tells us they did not think
the private armed self-defense right was of paramount
importance. See Amar, The Bill of Rights as a Constitu
tion, 100 Yale L. J. 1131, 1164 (1991) (“[T]o see the [Sec
ond] Amendment as primarily concerned with an individ
ual right to hunt, or protect one’s home,” would be “like
viewing the heart of the speech and assembly clauses as
the right of persons to meet to play bridge”); see also, e.g.,
Rakove, The Second Amendment: The Highest Stage of
Originalism, 76 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 103, 127–128 (2000);
Brief for Historians on Early American Legal, Constitu
tional, and Pennsylvania History as Amici Curiae 22–33.
   Further, there is no popular consensus that the private
self-defense right described in Heller is fundamental. The
plurality suggests that two amici briefs filed in the case
show such a consensus, see ante, at 42–43, but, of course,
numerous amici briefs have been filed opposing incorpora
tion as well. Moreover, every State regulates firearms
extensively, and public opinion is sharply divided on the
appropriate level of regulation. Much of this disagreement
rests upon empirical considerations. One side believes the
right essential to protect the lives of those attacked in the
home; the other side believes it essential to regulate the
right in order to protect the lives of others attacked with
guns. It seems unlikely that definitive evidence will de
velop one way or the other. And the appropriate level of
firearm regulation has thus long been, and continues to
be, a hotly contested matter of political debate. See, e.g.,
Siegel, Dead or Alive: Originalism as Popular Constitu
10                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

tionalism in Heller, 122 Harv. L. Rev. 191, 201–246 (2008).
(Numerous sources supporting arguments and data in
Part II–B can be found in the Appendix, infra.)
   Moreover, there is no reason here to believe that incor
poration of the private self-defense right will further any
other or broader constitutional objective. We are aware of
no argument that gun-control regulations target or are
passed with the purpose of targeting “discrete and insular
minorities.” Carolene Products Co., supra, at 153, n. 4;
see, e.g., ante, at 49–51 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Nor will
incorporation help to assure equal respect for individuals.
Unlike the First Amendment’s rights of free speech, free
press, assembly, and petition, the private self-defense
right does not comprise a necessary part of the democratic
process that the Constitution seeks to establish. See, e.g.,
Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 377 (1927) (Brandeis,
J., concurring). Unlike the First Amendment’s religious
protections, the Fourth Amendment’s protection against
unreasonable searches and seizures, the Fifth and Sixth
Amendments’ insistence upon fair criminal procedure, and
the Eighth Amendment’s protection against cruel and
unusual punishments, the private self-defense right does
not significantly seek to protect individuals who might
otherwise suffer unfair or inhumane treatment at the
hands of a majority. Unlike the protections offered by
many of these same Amendments, it does not involve
matters as to which judges possess a comparative exper
tise, by virtue of their close familiarity with the justice
system and its operation. And, unlike the Fifth Amend
ment’s insistence on just compensation, it does not involve
a matter where a majority might unfairly seize for itself
property belonging to a minority.
   Finally, incorporation of the right will work a significant
disruption in the constitutional allocation of decisionmak
ing authority, thereby interfering with the Constitution’s
ability to further its objectives.

   First, on any reasonable accounting, the incorporation of
the right recognized in Heller would amount to a signifi
cant incursion on a traditional and important area of state
concern, altering the constitutional relationship between
the States and the Federal Government. Private gun
regulation is the quintessential exercise of a State’s “police
power”—i.e., the power to “protec[t] . . . the lives, limbs,
health, comfort, and quiet of all persons, and the protec
tion of all property within the State,” by enacting “all
kinds of restraints and burdens” on both “persons and
property.” Slaughter-House Cases, <span class="citation">

            <span class="page">36</span>
         </a>
      </span>, 62 (1873)
(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court has long
recognized that the Constitution grants the States special
authority to enact laws pursuant to this power. See, e.g.,
Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 475 (1996) (noting
that States have “great latitude” to use their police powers
(internal quotation marks omitted)); Metropolitan Life Ins.
Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 756 (1985). A decade
ago, we wrote that there is “no better example of the police
power” than “the suppression of violent crime.” United
States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 618 (2000). And exam
ples in which the Court has deferred to state legislative
judgments in respect to the exercise of the police power
are legion. See, e.g., Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243,
270 (2006) (assisted suicide); Washington v. Glucksberg,
521 U. S. 702, 721 (1997) (same); Berman v. Parker, 348
U. S. 26, 32 (1954) (“We deal, in other words, with what
traditionally has been known as the police power. An
attempt to define its reach or trace its outer limits is
fruitless . . .”).
   Second, determining the constitutionality of a particular
state gun law requires finding answers to complex empiri
cally based questions of a kind that legislatures are better
able than courts to make. See, e.g., Los Angeles v. Ala
meda Books, Inc., 535 U. S. 425, 440 (2002) (plurality
opinion); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520
12                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                    BREYER, J., dissenting

U. S. 180, 195–196 (1997). And it may require this kind of
analysis in virtually every case.
   Government regulation of the right to bear arms nor
mally embodies a judgment that the regulation will help
save lives. The determination whether a gun regulation is
constitutional would thus almost always require the
weighing of the constitutional right to bear arms against
the “primary concern of every government—a concern for
the safety and indeed the lives of its citizens.” United
States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 755 (1987). With respect
to other incorporated rights, this sort of inquiry is some
times present. See, e.g., Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S.
444, 447 (1969) (per curiam) (free speech); Sherbert v.
Verner, 374 U. S. 398, 403 (1963) (religion); Brigham City
v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403–404 (2006) (Fourth Amend
ment); New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 655 (1984)
(Fifth Amendment); Salerno, supra, at 755 (bail). But
here, this inquiry—calling for the fine tuning of protective
rules—is likely to be part of a daily judicial diet.
   Given the competing interests, courts will have to try to
answer empirical questions of a particularly difficult kind.
Suppose, for example, that after a gun regulation’s adop
tion the murder rate went up. Without the gun regulation
would the murder rate have risen even faster? How is this
conclusion affected by the local recession which has left
numerous people unemployed? What about budget cuts
that led to a downsizing of the police force? How effective
was that police force to begin with? And did the regula
tion simply take guns from those who use them for lawful
purposes without affecting their possession by criminals?
   Consider too that countless gun regulations of many
shapes and sizes are in place in every State and in many
local communities. Does the right to possess weapons for
self-defense extend outside the home? To the car? To
work? What sort of guns are necessary for self-defense?
Handguns? Rifles? Semiautomatic weapons? When is a
                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          13

                    BREYER, J., dissenting

gun semi-automatic? Where are different kinds of weap
ons likely needed? Does time-of-day matter? Does the
presence of a child in the house matter? Does the pres
ence of a convicted felon in the house matter? Do police
need special rules permitting patdowns designed to find
guns? When do registration requirements become severe
to the point that they amount to an unconstitutional ban?
Who can possess guns and of what kind? Aliens? Prior
drug offenders? Prior alcohol abusers? How would the
right interact with a state or local government’s ability to
take special measures during, say, national security emer
gencies? As the questions suggest, state and local gun
regulation can become highly complex, and these “are only
a few uncertainties that quickly come to mind.” Caperton
v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (ROB-
ERTS, C. J., dissenting) (slip op., at 10).
   The difficulty of finding answers to these questions is
exceeded only by the importance of doing so. Firearms
cause well over 60,000 deaths and injuries in the United
States each year. Those who live in urban areas, police
officers, women, and children, all may be particularly at
risk. And gun regulation may save their lives. Some
experts have calculated, for example, that Chicago’s hand
gun ban has saved several hundred lives, perhaps close to
1,000, since it was enacted in 1983. Other experts argue
that stringent gun regulations “can help protect police
officers operating on the front lines against gun violence,”
have reduced homicide rates in Washington, D. C., and
Baltimore, and have helped to lower New York’s crime and
homicide rates.
   At the same time, the opponents of regulation cast doubt
on these studies. And who is right? Finding out may
require interpreting studies that are only indirectly re
lated to a particular regulatory statute, say one banning
handguns in the home. Suppose studies find more acci
dents and suicides where there is a handgun in the home
14                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

than where there is a long gun in the home or no gun at
all? To what extent do such studies justify a ban? What if
opponents of the ban put forth counter studies?
   In answering such questions judges cannot simply refer
to judicial homilies, such as Blackstone’s 18th-century
perception that a man’s home is his castle. See 4 Black
stone 223. Nor can the plurality so simply reject, by mere
assertion, the fact that “incorporation will require judges
to assess the costs and benefits of firearms restrictions.”
Ante, at 44. How can the Court assess the strength of the
government’s regulatory interests without addressing
issues of empirical fact? How can the Court determine if a
regulation is appropriately tailored without considering its
impact? And how can the Court determine if there are
less restrictive alternatives without considering what will
happen if those alternatives are implemented?
   Perhaps the Court could lessen the difficulty of the
mission it has created for itself by adopting a jurispruden
tial approach similar to the many state courts that admin
ister a state constitutional right to bear arms. See infra,
at 19–20 (describing state approaches). But the Court has
not yet done so. Cf. Heller, 544 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
57–64) (rejecting an “ ‘interest-balancing’ approach” simi
lar to that employed by the States); ante, at 44 (plurality
opinion). Rather, the Court has haphazardly created a few
simple rules, such as that it will not touch “prohibitions on
the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,”
“laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive
places such as schools and government buildings,” or “laws
imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial
sale of arms.” Heller, 544 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 54–55);
Ante, at 39 (plurality opinion). But why these rules and
not others? Does the Court know that these regulations
are justified by some special gun-related risk of death? In
fact, the Court does not know. It has simply invented
rules that sound sensible without being able to explain
                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

why or how Chicago’s handgun ban is different.
  The fact is that judges do not know the answers to the
kinds of empirically based questions that will often deter
mine the need for particular forms of gun regulation. Nor
do they have readily available “tools” for finding and
evaluating the technical material submitted by others.
District Attorney’s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Os
borne, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 21); see also
Turner Broadcasting, 520 U. S., at 195–196. Judges can
not easily make empirically based predictions; they have
no way to gather and evaluate the data required to see if
such predictions are accurate; and the nature of litigation
and concerns about stare decisis further make it difficult
for judges to change course if predictions prove inaccurate.
Nor can judges rely upon local community views and
values when reaching judgments in circumstances where
prediction is difficult because the basic facts are unclear or
unknown.
  At the same time, there is no institutional need to send
judges off on this “mission-almost-impossible.” Legislators
are able to “amass the stuff of actual experience and cull
conclusions from it.” United States v. Gainey, 380 U. S.
63, 67 (1965). They are far better suited than judges to
uncover facts and to understand their relevance. And
legislators, unlike Article III judges, can be held democ
ratically responsible for their empirically based and value
laden conclusions. We have thus repeatedly affirmed our
preference for “legislative not judicial solutions” to this
kind of problem, see, e.g., Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla.,
457 U. S. 496, 513 (1982), just as we have repeatedly
affirmed the Constitution’s preference for democratic
solutions legislated by those whom the people elect.
  In New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 310–
311 (1932), Justice Brandeis stated in dissent:
    “Some people assert that our present plight is due, in
16                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

     part, to the limitations set by courts upon experimen
     tation in the fields of social and economic science; and
     to the discouragement to which proposals for better
     ment there have been subjected otherwise. There
     must be power in the States and the Nation to re
     mould, through experimentation, our economic prac
     tices and institutions to meet changing social and eco
     nomic needs. I cannot believe that the framers of the
     Fourteenth Amendment, or the States which ratified
     it, intended to deprive us of the power to correct [the
     social problems we face].”
  There are 50 state legislatures. The fact that this Court
may already have refused to take this wise advice with
respect to Congress in Heller is no reason to make matters
worse here.
  Third, the ability of States to reflect local preferences
and conditions—both key virtues of federalism—here has
particular importance. The incidence of gun ownership
varies substantially as between crowded cities and uncon
gested rural communities, as well as among the different
geographic regions of the country. Thus, approximately
60% of adults who live in the relatively sparsely populated
Western States of Alaska, Montana, and Wyoming report
that their household keeps a gun, while fewer than 15% of
adults in the densely populated Eastern States of Rhode
Island, New Jersey, and Massachusetts say the same.
  The nature of gun violence also varies as between rural
communities and cities. Urban centers face significantly
greater levels of firearm crime and homicide, while rural
communities have proportionately greater problems with
nonhomicide gun deaths, such as suicides and accidents.
And idiosyncratic local factors can lead to two cities find
ing themselves in dramatically different circumstances:
For example, in 2008, the murder rate was 40 times
higher in New Orleans than it was in Lincoln, Nebraska.
                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          17

                    BREYER, J., dissenting

   It is thus unsurprising that States and local communi
ties have historically differed about the need for gun regu
lation as well as about its proper level. Nor is it surpris
ing that “primarily, and historically,” the law has treated
the exercise of police powers, including gun control, as
“matter[s] of local concern.” Medtronic, 518 U. S., at 475
(internal quotation marks omitted).
   Fourth, although incorporation of any right removes
decisions from the democratic process, the incorporation of
this particular right does so without strong offsetting
justification—as the example of Oak Park’s handgun ban
helps to show. See Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code, §27–2–
1 (1995). Oak Park decided to ban handguns in 1983,
after a local attorney was shot to death with a handgun
that his assailant had smuggled into a courtroom in a
blanket. Brief for Oak Park Citizens Committee for
Handgun Control as Amicus Curiae 1, 21 (hereinafter Oak
Park Brief). A citizens committee spent months gathering
information about handguns. Id., at 21. It secured 6,000
signatures from community residents in support of a ban.
Id., at 21–22. And the village board enacted a ban into
law. Id., at 22.
   Subsequently, at the urging of ban opponents the Board
held a community referendum on the matter. Ibid. The
citizens committee argued strongly in favor of the ban.
Id., at 22–23. It pointed out that most guns owned in Oak
Park were handguns and that handguns were misused
more often than citizens used them in self-defense. Id., at
23. The ban opponents argued just as strongly to the
contrary. Ibid. The public decided to keep the ban by a
vote of 8,031 to 6,368. Ibid. And since that time, Oak
Park now tells us, crime has decreased and the community
has seen no accidental handgun deaths. Id., at 2.
   Given the empirical and local value-laden nature of the
questions that lie at the heart of the issue, why, in a Na
tion whose Constitution foresees democratic decisionmak
18                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

ing, is it so fundamental a matter as to require taking that
power from the people? What is it here that the people did
not know? What is it that a judge knows better?
                        *     *    *
  In sum, the police power, the superiority of legislative
decisionmaking, the need for local decisionmaking, the
comparative desirability of democratic decisionmaking,
the lack of a manageable judicial standard, and the life
threatening harm that may flow from striking down regu
lations all argue against incorporation. Where the incor
poration of other rights has been at issue, some of these
problems have arisen. But in this instance all these prob
lems are present, all at the same time, and all are likely to
be present in most, perhaps nearly all, of the cases in
which the constitutionality of a gun regulation is at issue.
At the same time, the important factors that favor incor
poration in other instances—e.g., the protection of broader
constitutional objectives—are not present here. The up
shot is that all factors militate against incorporation—
with the possible exception of historical factors.
                             III
  I must, then, return to history. The plurality, in seeking
to justify incorporation, asks whether the interests the
Second Amendment protects are “ ‘deeply rooted in this
Nation’s history and tradition.’ ” Ante, at 19 (quoting
Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721; internal quotation marks
omitted). It looks to selected portions of the Nation’s
history for the answer. And it finds an affirmative reply.
  As I have made clear, I do not believe history is the only
pertinent consideration. Nor would I read history as
broadly as the majority does. In particular, since we here
are evaluating a more particular right—namely, the right
to bear arms for purposes of private self-defense—general
historical references to the “right to keep and bear arms”
                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           19

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

are not always helpful. Depending upon context, early
historical sources may mean to refer to a militia-based
right—a matter of considerable importance 200 years
ago—which has, as the majority points out, “largely faded
as a popular concern.” Ante, at 22. There is no reason to
believe that matters of such little contemporary impor
tance should play a significant role in answering the
incorporation question. See Apodaca, 406 U. S., at 410
(incorporation “inquiry must focus upon the function
served” by the right in question in “contemporary soci
ety”); Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25, 27 (1949) (incorpora
tion must take into account “the movements of a free
society” and “the gradual and empiric process of inclusion
and exclusion” (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf.
U. S. Const., Art. I, §910 (prohibiting federal officeholders
from accepting a “Title, of any kind whatever, from [a]
foreign State”—presumably a matter of considerable
importance 200 years ago).
   That said, I can find much in the historical record that
shows that some Americans in some places at certain
times thought it important to keep and bear arms for
private self-defense. For instance, the reader will see that
many States have constitutional provisions protecting gun
possession. But, as far as I can tell, those provisions
typically do no more than guarantee that a gun regulation
will be a reasonable police power regulation. See Winkler,
Scrutinizing the Second Amendment, 105 Mich. L. Rev.
683, 686, 716–717 (2007) (the “courts of every state to
consider the question apply a deferential ‘reasonable
regulation’ standard”) (hereinafter Winkler, Scrutinizing);
see also id., at 716–717 (explaining the difference between
that standard and ordinary rational-basis review). It is
thus altogether unclear whether such provisions would
prohibit cities such as Chicago from enacting laws, such as
the law before us, banning handguns. See id., at 723. The
majority, however, would incorporate a right that is likely
20                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

inconsistent with Chicago’s law; and the majority would
almost certainly strike down that law. Cf. Heller, 554
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 57–64) (striking down the District
of Columbia’s handgun ban).
   Thus, the specific question before us is not whether
there are references to the right to bear arms for self
defense throughout this Nation’s history—of course there
are—or even whether the Court should incorporate a
simple constitutional requirement that firearms regula
tions not unreasonably burden the right to keep and bear
arms, but rather whether there is a consensus that so
substantial a private self-defense right as the one de
scribed in Heller applies to the States. See, e.g., Glucks
berg, supra, at 721 (requiring “a careful description” of the
right at issue when deciding whether it is “deeply rooted
in this Nation’s history and tradition” (internal quotation
marks omitted)). On this question, the reader will have to
make up his or her own mind about the historical record
that I describe in part below. In my view, that record is
insufficient to say that the right to bear arms for private
self-defense, as explicated by Heller, is fundamental in the
sense relevant to the incorporation inquiry. As the evi
dence below shows, States and localities have consistently
enacted firearms regulations, including regulations simi
lar to those at issue here, throughout our Nation’s history.
Courts have repeatedly upheld such regulations. And it is,
at the very least, possible, and perhaps likely, that incor
poration will impose on every, or nearly every, State a
different right to bear arms than they currently recog
nize—a right that threatens to destabilize settled state
legal principles. Cf. 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 57–64)
(rejecting an “ ‘interest-balancing’ approach” similar to
that employed by the States).
   I thus cannot find a historical consensus with respect to
whether the right described by Heller is “fundamental” as
our incorporation cases use that term. Nor can I find
                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            21

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

sufficient historical support for the majority’s conclusion
that that right is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history
and tradition.” Instead, I find no more than ambiguity
and uncertainty that perhaps even expert historians
would find difficult to penetrate. And a historical record
that is so ambiguous cannot itself provide an adequate
basis for incorporating a private right of self-defense and
applying it against the States.
The Eighteenth Century
   The opinions in Heller collect much of the relevant 18th
century evidence. See 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5–32);
id., at ___ (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5–31); id.,
at ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4–7). In respect
to the relevant question—the “deeply rooted nature” of a
right to keep and bear arms for purposes of private self
defense—that evidence is inconclusive, particularly when
augmented as follows:
   First, as I have noted earlier in this opinion, and JUS-
TICE STEVENS argued in dissent, the history discussed in
Heller shows that the Second Amendment was enacted
primarily for the purpose of protecting militia-related
rights. See supra, at 4; Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5–
31). Many of the scholars and historians who have written
on the subject apparently agree. See supra, at 2–5.
   Second, historians now tell us that the right to which
Blackstone referred, an important link in the Heller ma
jority’s historical argument, concerned the right of Par
liament (representing the people) to form a militia to
oppose a tyrant (the King) threatening to deprive the
people of their traditional liberties (which did not include
an unregulated right to possess guns). Thus, 18th-century
language referring to a “right to keep and bear arms” does
not ipso facto refer to a private right of self-defense—
certainly not unambiguously so. See English Historians’
Brief 3–27; see also supra, at 2–5.
22                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

  Third, scholarly articles indicate that firearms were
heavily regulated at the time of the framing—perhaps
more heavily regulated than the Court in Heller believed.
For example, one scholar writes that “[h]undreds of indi
vidual statutes regulated the possession and use of guns
in colonial and early national America.” Churchill, Gun
Regulation, the Police Power, and the Right to Keep Arms,
25 Law &amp; Hist. Rev. 139, 143 (2007). Among these stat
utes was a ban on the private firing of weapons in Boston,
as well as comprehensive restrictions on similar conduct
in Philadelphia and New York. See Acts and Laws of
Massachusetts, p. 208 (1746); 5 J. Mitchell, &amp; H. Flanders,
Statutes at Large of Pennsylvania From 1682 to 1801, pp.
108–109 (1898); 4 Colonial Laws of New York ch. 1233, p.
748 (1894); see also Churchill, supra, at 162–163 (discuss
ing bans on the shooting of guns in Pennsylvania and New
York).
  Fourth, after the Constitution was adopted, several
States continued to regulate firearms possession by, for
example, adopting rules that would have prevented the
carrying of loaded firearms in the city, Heller, 554 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 5–7) (BREYER, J., dissenting); see also id.,
at ___ (slip op., at 59–60). Scholars have thus concluded
that the primary Revolutionary era limitation on a State’s
police power to regulate guns appears to be only that
regulations were “aimed at a legitimate public purpose”
and “consistent with reason.” Cornell, Early American
Gun Regulation and the Second Amendment, 25 Law &amp;
Hist. Rev. 197, 198 (2007).
The Pre-Civil War Nineteenth Century
   I would also augment the majority’s account of this
period as follows:
   First, additional States began to regulate the discharge
of firearms in public places. See, e.g., Act of Feb. 17, 1831,
§6, reprinted in 3 Statutes of Ohio and the Northwestern
                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          23

                    BREYER, J., dissenting

Territory 1740 (S. Chase ed. 1835); Act of Dec. 3, 1825, ch.
CCXCII, §3, 1825 Tenn. Priv. Acts 306.
   Second, States began to regulate the possession of con
cealed weapons, which were both popular and dangerous.
See, e.g., C. Cramer, Concealed Weapon Laws of the Early
Republic 143–152 (1999) (collecting examples); see also
1837–1838 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 137, pp. 200–201 (banning
the wearing, sale, or giving of Bowie knives); 1847 Va.
Acts ch. 7, §8, p. 110, (“Any free person who shall habitu
ally carry about his person, hidden from common observa
tion, any pistol, dirk, bowie knife, or weapon of the like
kind, from the use of which the death of any person might
probably ensue, shall for every offense be punished by [a]
fine not exceed fifty dollars”).
   State courts repeatedly upheld the validity of such laws,
finding that, even when the state constitution granted a
right to bear arms, the legislature was permitted to, e.g.,
“abolish” these small, inexpensive, “most dangerous weap
ons entirely from use,” even in self-defense. Day v. State,

      </span>, 616–617 (1840).
The Post-Civil War Nineteenth Century
   It is important to read the majority’s account with the
following considerations in mind:
   First, the Court today properly declines to revisit our
interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause. See
ante, at 10. The Court’s case for incorporation must thus
rest on the conclusion that the right to bear arms is “fun
24                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                      BREYER, J., dissenting

damental.” But the very evidence that it advances in
support of the conclusion that Reconstruction-era Ameri
cans strongly supported a private self-defense right shows
with equal force that Americans wanted African-American
citizens to have the same rights to possess guns as did
white citizens. Ante, at 22–33. Here, for example is what
Congress said when it enacted a Fourteenth Amendment
predecessor, the Second Freedman’s Bureau Act. It wrote
that the statute, in order to secure “the constitutional
right to bear arms . . . for all citizens,” would assure that
each citizen:
     “shall have . . . full and equal benefit of all laws and
     proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal se
     curity, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition
     of estate, real and personal, including the constitu
     tional right to bear arms, [by securing] . . . to . . . all
     the citizens of [every] . . . State or district without re
     spect to race or color, or previous condition of slavery.”
     §14, 14 Stat. 176–177 (emphasis added).
This sounds like an antidiscrimination provision. See
Rosenthal, The New Originalism Meets the Fourteenth
Amendment: Original Public Meaning and the Problem of
Incorporation, 18 J. Contemp. Legal Issues 361, 383–384
(2009) (discussing evidence that the Freedmen’s Bureau
was focused on discrimination).
    Another Fourteenth Amendment predecessor, the Civil
Rights Act of 1866, also took aim at discrimination. See
§1, 14 Stat. 27 (citizens of “every race and color, without
regard to any previous condition of slavery or involuntary
servitude . . . shall have the same right [to engage in
various activities] and to full and equal benefit of all laws
. . . as is enjoyed by white citizens”). And, of course, the
Fourteenth Amendment itself insists that all States guar
antee their citizens the “equal protection of the laws.”
    There is thus every reason to believe that the funda
                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           25

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

mental concern of the Reconstruction Congress was the
eradication of discrimination, not the provision of a new
substantive right to bear arms free from reasonable state
police power regulation. See, e.g., Brief for Municipal
Respondents 62–69 (discussing congressional record evi
dence that Reconstruction Congress was concerned about
discrimination). Indeed, why would those who wrote the
Fourteenth Amendment have wanted to give such a right
to Southerners who had so recently waged war against the
North, and who continued to disarm and oppress recently
freed African-American citizens? Cf. Act of Mar. 2, 1867,
§6, 14 Stat. 487 (disbanding Southern militias because
they were, inter alia, disarming the freedmen).
   Second, firearms regulation in the later part of the 19th
century was common. The majority is correct that the
Freedmen’s Bureau points to a right to bear arms, and it
stands to reason, as the majority points out, that “[i]t
would have been nonsensical for Congress to guarantee
the . . . equal benefit of a . . . right that does not exist.”
Ante, at 32. But the majority points to no evidence that
there existed during this period a fundamental right to
bear arms for private self-defense immune to the reason
able exercise of the state police power. See Emberton, The
Limits of Incorporation: Violence, Gun Rights, and Gun
Regulation in the Reconstruction South, 17 Stan. L. &amp;
Pol’y Rev. 615, 621–622 (2006) (noting that history shows
that “nineteenth-century Americans” were “not opposed to
the idea that the state should be able to control the use of
firearms”).
   To the contrary, in the latter half of the 19th century, a
number of state constitutions adopted or amended after
the Civil War explicitly recognized the legislature’s gen
eral ability to limit the right to bear arms. See Tex.
Const., Art. I, §13 (1869) (protecting “the right to keep and
bear arms,” “under such regulations as the legislature
may prescribe”); Idaho Const., Art. I, §11 (1889) (“The
26                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                     BREYER, J., dissenting

people have the right to bear arms . . .; but the Legislature
shall regulate the exercise of this right by law”); Utah
Const., Art. I, §6 (1896) (same). And numerous other state
constitutional provisions adopted during this period ex
plicitly granted the legislature various types of regulatory
power over firearms. See Brief for Thirty-Four Profes
sional Historians et al. as Amici Curiae 14–15 (hereinafter
Legal Historians’ Brief).
   Moreover, four States largely banned the possession of
all nonmilitary handguns during this period. See 1879
Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 186, §1 (prohibiting citizens from
carrying “publicly or privately, any . . . belt or pocket
pistol, revolver, or any kind of pistol, except the army or
navy pistol, usually used in warfare, which shall be car
ried openly in the hand”); 1876 Wyo. Comp. Laws ch. 52,
§1 (forbidding “concealed or ope[n]” bearing of “any fire
arm or other deadly weapon, within the limits of any city,
town or village”); Ark. Act of Apr. 1, 1881, ch. 96, §1 (pro
hibiting the “wear[ing] or carry[ng]” of “any pistol . . .
except such pistols as are used in the army or navy,”
except while traveling or at home); Tex. Act of Apr. 12,
1871, ch. 34 (prohibiting the carrying of pistols unless
there are “immediate and pressing” reasonable grounds to
fear “immediate and pressing” attack or for militia ser
vice). Fifteen States banned the concealed carry of pistols
and other deadly weapons. See Legal Historians’ Brief 16,
n. 14. And individual municipalities enacted stringent
gun controls, often in response to local conditions—Dodge
City, Kansas, for example, joined many western cattle
towns in banning the carrying of pistols and other danger
ous weapons in response to violence accompanying west
ern cattle drives. See Brief for Municipal Respondents 30
(citing Dodge City, Kan., Ordinance No. 16, §XI (Sept. 22,
1876)); D. Courtwright, The Cowboy Subculture, in Guns
in America: A Reader 96 (J. Dizard et al. eds. 1999) (dis

“check” their guns upon entering town).
  Further, much as they had during the period before the
Civil War, state courts routinely upheld such restrictions.
See, e.g., English v. State, <span class="citation no-link">

      </span>, 373 (1891). The
Tennessee Supreme Court, in upholding a ban on posses
sion of nonmilitary handguns and certain other weapons,
summarized the Reconstruction understanding of the
states’ police power to regulate firearms:
    “Admitting the right of self-defense in its broadest
    sense, still on sound principle every good citizen is
    bound to yield his preference as to the means to be
    used, to the demands of the public good; and where
    certain weapons are forbidden to be kept or used by the
    law of the land, in order to the prevention of [sic]
    crime—a great public end—no man can be permitted
    to disregard this general end, and demand of the
    community the right, in order to gratify his whim or
    willful desire to use a particular weapon in his par
    ticular self-defense. The law allows ample means of
    self-defense, without the use of the weapons which we
    have held may be rightfully prescribed by this statute.
    The object being to banish these weapons from the
    community by an absolute prohibition for the preven
    tion of crime, no man’s particular safety, if such case
    could exist, ought to be allowed to defeat this end.”

      </span>, 188–189 (1871) (em
    phasis added).
The Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries
  Although the majority does not discuss 20th- or 21st
century evidence concerning the Second Amendment at
any length, I think that it is essential to consider the
recent history of the right to bear arms for private self
defense when considering whether the right is “fundamen
28                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                    BREYER, J., dissenting

tal.” To that end, many States now provide state constitu
tional protection for an individual’s right to keep and bear
arms. See Volokh, State Constitutional Rights to Keep
and Bear Arms, 11 Tex. Rev. L. &amp; Pol. 191, 205 (2006)
(identifying over 40 States). In determining the impor
tance of this fact, we should keep the following considera
tions in mind:
   First, by the end of the 20th century, in every State and
many local communities, highly detailed and complicated
regulatory schemes governed (and continue to govern)
nearly every aspect of firearm ownership: Who may sell
guns and how they must be sold; who may purchase guns
and what type of guns may be purchased; how firearms
must be stored and where they may be used; and so on.
See generally Legal Community Against Violence, Regu
lating Guns In America (2008), available at http://
www.lcav.org/publications-briefs/regulating_guns. asp (all
Internet materials as visited June 24, 2010, and available
in Clerk of Court’s case file) (detailing various arms regu
lations in every State).
   Of particular relevance here, some municipalities ban
handguns, even in States that constitutionally protect the
right to bear arms. See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code, §8–
20–050(c) (2009); Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code, §§27–2–
1, 27–1–1 (1995); Toledo, Ohio, Municipal Code, ch. 549.25
(2010). Moreover, at least seven States and Puerto Rico
ban assault weapons or semiautomatic weapons. See Cal.
Penal Code Ann. §12280(b) (West Supp. 2009); Conn. Gen.
Stat. Ann. §53–202c (2007); Haw. Rev. Stat. §134–8
(1993); Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. §4–303(a) (Lexis 2002);
Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 140, §131M (West 2006); N. J. Stat.
Ann. §2C:39-5 (West Supp. 2010); N. Y. Penal Law Ann.
§265.02(7) (West Supp. 2008); 25 Laws P. R. Ann. §456m
(Supp. 2006); see also 18 U. S. C. §922(o) (federal ma
chinegun ban).
   Thirteen municipalities do the same. See Albany, N. Y.,

nances §29–49(a) (2009); Buffalo, N. Y., City Code §180–

Toledo, Ohio, Municipal Code §549.23(a). And two States,
Maryland and Hawaii, ban assault pistols. See Haw. Rev.
Stat. Ann. §134–8; Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. §4–303
(Lexis 2002).
   Second, as I stated earlier, state courts in States with
constitutions that provide gun rights have almost uni
formly interpreted those rights as providing protection
only against unreasonable regulation of guns. See, e.g.,
Winkler, Scrutinizing 686 (the “courts of every state to
consider” a gun regulation apply the “ ‘reasonable regula
tion’ ” approach); State v. McAdams, 714 P. 2d 1236, 1238
(Wyo. 1986); Robertson v. City &amp; County of Denver, 874
P. 2d 325, 328 (Colo. 1994).
   When determining reasonableness those courts have
normally adopted a highly deferential attitude towards
legislative determinations. See Winkler, Scrutinizing 723
(identifying only six cases in the 60 years before the arti
cle’s publication striking down gun control laws: three that
banned “the transportation of any firearms for any pur
pose whatsoever,” a single “permitting law,” and two as
applied challenges in “unusual circumstances”). Hence, as
evidenced by the breadth of existing regulations, States
and local governments maintain substantial flexibility to
regulate firearms—much as they seemingly have through
out the Nation’s history—even in those States with an
arms right in their constitutions.
30                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO

                    BREYER, J., dissenting

    Although one scholar implies that state courts are less
willing to permit total gun prohibitions, see Volokh, Im
plementing the Right to Keep and Bear Arms for Self-
Defense: An Analytical Framework and a Research
Agenda, 56 UCLA L. Rev. 1443, 1458 (2009), I am aware
of no instances in the past 50 years in which a state court
has struck down as unconstitutional a law banning a
particular class of firearms, see Winkler, Scrutinizing 723.
   Indeed, state courts have specifically upheld as constitu
tional (under their state constitutions) firearms regula
tions that have included handgun bans. See Kalodimos v.
Village of Morton Grove, <span class="citation">
         <a href="/ill/bnia/kalodimos-v-village-of-morton-grove/">
            <span class="volume">103</span>

         </a>
      </span>, *5 (Ohio Ct. App.,
Aug. 4, 1977) (handgun ban “does not absolutely interfere
with the right of the people to bear arms, but rather pro
scribes possession of a specifically defined category of
handguns”); State v. Bolin 378 S. C. 96, 99, 662 S. E. 2d
38, 39 (2008) (ban on handgun possession by persons
under 21 did not infringe arms right because they can
“posses[s] other types of guns”). Thus, the majority’s
decision to incorporate the private self-defense right rec
ognized in Heller threatens to alter state regulatory re
gimes, at least as they pertain to handguns.
   Third, the plurality correctly points out that only a few
state courts, a “paucity” of state courts, have specifically
upheld handgun bans. Ante, at 39. But which state courts
have struck them down? The absence of supporting in
formation does not help the majority find support. Cf.
United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 496 (1997) (noting
that it is “treacherous to find in congressional silence
alone the adoption of a controlling rule of law” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). Silence does not show or tend
to show a consensus that a private self-defense right

                    BREYER, J., dissenting

(strong enough to strike down a handgun ban) is “deeply
rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.”
                         *   *     *
   In sum, the Framers did not write the Second Amend
ment in order to protect a private right of armed self
defense. There has been, and is, no consensus that the
right is, or was, “fundamental.” No broader constitutional
interest or principle supports legal treatment of that right
as fundamental. To the contrary, broader constitutional
concerns of an institutional nature argue strongly against
that treatment.
   Moreover, nothing in 18th-, 19th-, 20th-, or 21st-century
history shows a consensus that the right to private armed
self-defense, as described in Heller, is “deeply rooted in
this Nation’s history or tradition” or is otherwise “funda
mental.” Indeed, incorporating the right recognized in
Heller may change the law in many of the 50 States. Read
in the majority’s favor, the historical evidence is at most
ambiguous. And, in the absence of any other support for
