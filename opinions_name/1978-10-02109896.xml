      <p> Syllabus </p>
      <p>Responding to evidence that during the 1973 petroleum shortage oil producers or refiners
         were favoring company-operated gasoline stations, Maryland enacted a statute prohibiting
         producers or refiners from operating retail service stations within the State, and
         requiring them to extend all "voluntary allowances" (temporary price reductions granted to
         independent dealers injured by local competitive price reductions) uniformly to all
         stations they supply. In actions by several oil companies challenging the validity of the
         statute on various grounds, the Maryland trial court held the statute invalid primarily on
         substantive due process grounds, but the Maryland Court of Appeals reversed, upholding the
         validity of the statute against contentions, inter alia, that it violated the Commerce and
         Due Process Clauses and conflicted with &amp;#167; 2(b) of the Clayton Act, as amended by
         the Robinson-Patman Act, which prohibits price discrimination, with the proviso that a
         seller can defend a price discrimination charge by showing that he charged a lower price in
         good faith to meet a competitor's equally low price. Held :</p>
      <p>1. The Maryland statute does not violate the Due Process Clause, since, regardless of the
         ultimate efficacy of the statute, it bears a reasonable relation to the State's legitimate
         purpose in controlling the gasoline retail market. Pp. 124-125.</p>
      <p>2. The divestiture provisions of the statute do not violate the Commerce Clause. Pp.
         125-129.</p>
      <p>(a) That the burden of such provisions falls solely on interstate companies does not, by
         itself, establish a claim of discrimination again t interstate commerce. The statute
         creates no barrier against interstate independent dealers, nor does it prohibit the flow of
         interstate goods, place added costs upon them, or distinguish between in-state and
         out-of-state companies in the retail market. Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm'n,

         </span>, 71 S.Ct. 295, 95 L.Ed. 329, distinguished. Pp. 125-126.</p>
      <p>(b) Nor does the fact that the burden of state regulation falls on interstate companies
         show that the statute impermissibly burdens interstate commerce, even if some refiners were
         to stop selling in the State because of the divestiture requirement and even if the
         elimination of company-operated stations were to deprive consumers of certain special
         services. Interstate commerce is not subjected to an impermissible burden simply because an
         otherwise valid regulation causes some business to shift from one interstate supplier to
         another. The Commerce Clause protects the interstate market, not particular interstate
         firms, from prohibitive or burdensome regulations. Pp. 127-128.</p>
      <p>(c) The Commerce Clause does not, by its own force, pre-empt the field of retail gasoline
         marketing, but, absent a relevant congressional declaration of policy, or a showing of a
         specific discrimination against, or burdening of, interstate commerce, the States have the
         power to regulate in this area. Pp. 128-129.</p>
      <p>3. The "voluntary allowances" requirement of the Maryland statute is not pre-empted by
         &amp;#167; 2(b) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, or the Sherman
         Act. Pp. 129-134.</p>
      <p>(a) Any hypothetical "conflict" arising from the possibility that the Maryland statute may
         require uniformity in some situations in which the Robinson-Patman Act would permit
         localized price discrimination is not sufficient to warrant pre-emption. P. 130-131.</p>
      <p>(b) Neither &amp;#167; 2(b) nor the federal policy favoring competition establishes a
         federal right to engage in discriminatory pricing in certain situations. Section 2(b)'s
         proviso is merely an exception to that statute's broad prohibition against discriminatory
         pricing and does not create any new federal right, but rather defines a specific, limited
         defense. Pp. 131-133.</p>
      <p>(c) While in the sense that the Maryland statute might have an anticompetitive effect there
         is a conflict between that statute and the Sherman Act's central policy of "economic
         liberty," nevertheless this sort of conflict cannot by itself constitute a sufficient
         reason for invalidating the Maryland statute, for if an adverse effect on competition were,
         in and of itself, enough to invalidate a state statute, the States' power to engage in
         economic regulation would be effectively destroyed. Pp. 133-134.</p>

      <p>* The Maryland statute is an outgrowth of the 1973 shortage of petroleum. In response to
         complaints about inequitable distribution of gasoline among retail stations, the Governor
         of Maryland directed the State Comptroller to conduct a market survey. The results of that
         survey indicated that gasoline stations operated by producers or refiners had received
         preferential treatment during the period of short supply. The Comptroller therefore
         proposed legislation which, according to the Court of Appeals, was "designed to correct the
         inequities in the distribution and pricing of gasoline reflected by the survey." Id., at
         421, 370 A.2d, at 1109. After legislative hearings and a "special veto hearing" before the
         Governor, the bill was enacted and signed into law.</p>


      <span class="num">4</span>
      <p>Shortly before the effective date of the Act, Exxon Corp. filed a declaratory judgment
         action challenging the statute in the Circuit Court of Anne Arundel County, Md. The
         essential facts alleged in the complaint are not in dispute. All of the gasoline sold by
         Exxon in Maryland is transported into the State from refineries located elsewhere. Although
         Exxon sells the bulk of this gas to wholesalers and independent retailers, it also sells
         directly to the consuming public through 36 company-operated stations.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref">3</a> Exxon uses these stations to test innovative marketing
         concepts or products.<a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref">4</a> Focusing primarily
         on the Act's requirement that it discontinue its operation of these 36 retail stations,
         Exxon's complaint challenged the validity of the statute on both constitutional and federal
         statutory grounds.<a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref">5</a>

      <p>During the ensuing nine months, six other oil companies instituted comparable actions.
         Three of these plaintiffs, or their subsidiaries, sell their gasoline in Maryland

         largely on high-volume sales with prices consistently lower than those offered by
         independent dealer-operated major brand stations. Testimony presented by these refiners
         indicated that company ownership is essential to their method of private brand, low-priced
         competition. They therefore joined Exxon in its attack on the divestiture provisions of the
         Maryland statute.</p>


      <span class="num">6</span>
      <p>The three other plaintiffs, like Exxon, sell major brands primarily through dealer-operated
         stations, although they also operate at least one retail station each.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn7" id="fn7_ref">7</a> They, too, challenged the statute's divestiture
         provisions, but, in addition, they specially challenged the requirement that "voluntary
         allowances" be extended uniformly to all retail service stations supplied in the State.
         Although not defined in the statute, the term "voluntary allowances" refers to temporary
         price reductions granted by the oil companies to independent dealers who are injured by
         local competitive price reductions of competing retailers.<a class="footnote" href="#fn8"
            id="fn8_ref">8</a> The oil companies regard these temporary allowances as legitimate
         price reductions protected by &amp;#167; 2(b). In advance of trial, Exxon, Shell, and Gulf

         conflict with &amp;#167; 2(b).</p>


      <span class="num">7</span>
      <p>The Circuit Court granted the motion, and the trial then focused on the validity of the
         divestiture provisions. As brought out during the trial, the salient characteristics of the
         Maryland retail gasoline market are as follows: Approximately 3,800 retail service stations
         in Maryland sell over 20 different brands of gasoline. However, no petroleum products are
         produced or refined in Maryland, and the number of stations actually operated by a refiner
         or an affiliate is relatively small, representing about 5% of the total number of Maryland
         retailers.</p>


      <span class="num">8</span>
      <p>The refiners introduced evidence indicating that their ownership of retail service stations
         has produced significant benefits for the consuming public.<a class="footnote" href="#fn9"
            id="fn9_ref">9</a> Moreover, the three refiners that now market solely through
         company-operated stations may elect to withdraw from the Maryland market altogether if the
         statute is enforced. There was, however, no evidence that the total quantity of petroleum
         products shipped into Maryland would be affected by the statute.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn10" id="fn10_ref">10</a> After trial, the Circuit Court held the entire statute
         invalid, primarily on substantive due process grounds.</p>


      <span class="num">9</span>
      <p>The Maryland Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting all of the refiners' attacks against both
         the divestiture provisions and the voluntary-allowance provision. Most of those attacks are
         not pursued here;<a class="footnote" href="#fn11" id="fn11_ref">11</a> instead, appellants

         gasoline and that this would eventually decrease the competitiveness of the retail market,
         the State enacted a law prohibiting producers and refiners from operating their own
         stations. Appellants argue that this response is irrational and that it will frustrate
         rather than further the State's desired goal of enhancing competition. But, as the Court of
         Appeals observed, this argument rests simply on an evaluation of the economic wisdom of the
         statute, 279 Md., at 428, 370 A.2d, at 1112, and cannot override the State's authority "to

      <p>III</p>

      <span class="num">11</span>
      <p>Appellants argue that the divestiture provisions of the Maryland statute violate the
         Commerce Clause in three ways: (1) by discriminating against interstate commerce; (2) by
         unduly burdening interstate commerce; and (3) by imposing controls on a commercial activity
         of such an essentially interstate character that it is not amenable to state
         regulation.</p>


      <span class="num">12</span>
      <p>Plainly, the Maryland statute does not discriminate against interstate goods, nor does it
         favor local producers and refiners. Since Maryland's entire gasoline supply flows in
         interstate commerce and since there are no local producers or refiners, such claims of
         disparate treatment between interstate and local commerce would be meritless. Appellants,
         however, focus on the retail market arguing that the effect of the statute is to protect
         in-state independent dealers from out-of-state competition. They contend that the
         divestiture provisions "create a protected enclave for Maryland independent dealers . .
            .."<a class="footnote" href="#fn14" id="fn14_ref">14</a> As support for this
         proposition, they rely on the fact that the burden of the divestiture requirements falls
         solely on interstate companies. But this fact does not lead, either logically or as a pra
         tical matter, to a conclusion that the State is discriminating against interstate commerce
         at the retail level.</p>


      <span class="num">13</span>
      <p>As the record shows, there are several major interstate marketers of petroleum that own and
         operate their own retail gasoline stations.<a class="footnote" href="#fn15" id="fn15_ref"
            >15</a> These interstate dealers, who compete directly with the Maryland independent
         dealers, are not affected by the Act because they do not refine or produce gasoline. In
         fact, the Act creates no barriers whatsoever against interstate independent dealers; it
         does not prohibit the flow of interstate goods, place added costs upon them, or distinguish
         between in-state and out-of-state companies in the retail market. The absence of any of
         these factors fully distinguishes this case from those in which a State has been found to
         have discriminated against interstate commerce. See, e. g., Hunt v. Washington Apple
         Advertising Comm'n., <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/yBr/hunt-v-washington-state-apple-advertising-commn/">

               <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>

            </a>
         </span>, 71 S.Ct. 295, 95 L.Ed. 329. For instance, the Court in Hunt noted that the
         challenged state statute raised the cost of doing business for out-of-state dealers, and,
         in various other ways, favored the in-state dealer in the local market. 432 U.S., at
         351-352, 97 S.Ct., at 2445-2446. No comparable claim can be made here. While the refiners
         will no longer enjoy their same status in the Maryland market, in-state independent dealers
         will have no competitive advantage over out-of-state dealers. The fact that the burden of a
         state regulation falls on some interstate companies does not, by itself, establish a claim
         of discrimination against interstate commerce.<a class="footnote" href="#fn16"
            id="fn16_ref">16</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">14</span>
      <p>Appellants argue, however, that this fact does show that the Maryland statute impermissibly
         burdens interstate commerce. They point to evidence in the record which indicates that,
         because of the divestiture requirements, at least three refiners will stop selling in
         Maryland, and which also supports their claim that the elimination of company-operated
         stations will deprive the consumer of certain special services. Even if we assume the truth
         of both assertions, neither warrants a finding that the statute impermissibly burdens
         interstate commerce.</p>


      <span class="num">15</span>
      <p>Some refiners may choose to withdraw entirely from the Maryland market, but there is no
         reason to assume that their share of the entire supply will not be promptly replaced by
         other interstate refiners. The source of the consumers' supply may switch from
         company-operated stations to independent dealers, but interstate commerce is not subjected
         to an impermissible burden simply because an otherwise valid regulation causes some
         business to shift from one interstate supplier to another.</p>


      <span class="num">16</span>
      <p>The crux of appellants' claim is that, regardless of whether the State has interfered with
         the movement of goods in interstate commerce, it has interfered "with the natural
         functioning of the interstate market either through prohibition or through burdensome
         regulation." Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., <span class="citation">

         </span>, 806, 96 S.Ct. 2488, 2496, 49 L.Ed.2d 220. Appellants then claim that the statute
         "will surely change the market structure by weakening the independent refiners . . .."<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn17" id="fn17_ref">17</a> We cannot, however, accept
         appellants' underlying notion that the Commerce Clause protects the particular structure or
         methods of operation in a retail market. See Breard v. Alexandria, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/xbV/breard-v-city-of-alexandria-la/">
               <span class="volume">341</span>
               <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
               <span class="page">622</span>
            </a>
         </span>, 71 S.Ct. 920, 95 L.Ed. 1233. As indicated by the Court in Hughes, the Clause
         protects the interstate market, not particular interstate firms, from prohibitive or
         burdensome regulations. It may be true that the consuming public will be injured by the
         loss of the high-volume, low-priced stations operated by the independent refiners, but
         again that argument relates to the wisdom of the statute, not to its burden on
         commerce.</p>


      <span class="num">17</span>
      <p>Finally, we cannot adopt appellants' novel suggestion that because the economic market for
         petroleum products is nationwide, no State has the power to regulate the retail marketing
         of gas. Appellants point out that many state legislatures have either enacted or considered
         proposals similar to Maryland's,<a class="footnote" href="#fn18" id="fn18_ref">18</a> and
         that the cumulative effect of this sort of legislation may have serious implications for
         their national marketing operations. While this concern is a significant one, we do not
         find that the Commerce Clause, by its own force, pre-empts the field of retail gas
         marketing. To be sure, "the Commerce Clause acts as a limitation upon state power even
         without congressional implementation." Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm'n., supra,
         432 U.S., at 350, 97 S.Ct., at 2445 (citations omitted). But this Court has only rarely
         held that the Commerce Clause itself pre-empts an entire field from state regulation, and
         then only when a lack of national uniformity would impede the flow of interstate goods. See
         Wabash, St. L. &amp;amp; P. R. Co. v. Illinois, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/tgj/wabash-st-l-pr-co-v-illinois/">

            <span class="page">299</span>
         </span>, 319, 13 L.Ed. 996. The evil that appellants perceive in this litigation is not
         that the several States will enact differing regulations, but rather that they will all
         conclude that divestiture provisions are warranted. The problem thus is not one of national
         uniformity. In the absence of a relevant congressional declaration of policy, or a showing
         of a specific discrimination against, or burdening of, interstate commerce, we cannot
         conclude that the States are without power to regulate in this area.</p>

      <p>IV</p>

      <span class="num">18</span>
      <p>Exxon, Phillips, Shell, and Gulf contend that the requirement that voluntary allowances be
         extended to all retail service stations is either in direct conflict with &amp;#167; 2(b)
         of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, or, more generally, in conflict
         with the basic federal policy in favor of competition, which is reflected in the Sherman
         Act as well as &amp;#167; 2(b). In rejecting these contentions, the Maryland Court of
         Appeals noted that the Maryland statute covered two different competitive situations.<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn19" id="fn19_ref">19</a> In the first situation a competing
         retailer lowers its price on its own, and the oil company gives its own retailer a price
         reduction to enable it to meet that lower price. In the second situation, the competing
         retailer's lower price is subsidized by its supplier, and the oil company gives its own
         retailer a price reduction to meet the competition. The good-faith defense of &amp;#167;
         2(b) is clearly not available to the oil company in the first situation because the
         voluntary allowance would not be a response t competition from another oil company. SeeFTC
         v. Sun Oil Co., <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/xEu/ftc-v-sun-oil-co/">
               <span class="volume">371</span>
               <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
               <span class="page">505</span>
            </a>
         </span>, 83 S.Ct. 358, 9 L.Ed.2d 466. In the second situation the law is unsettled,<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn20" id="fn20_ref">20</a> but the Court of Appeals concluded
         that the defense would also be unavailable. The court therefore reasoned that there was no
         conflict between the Maryland statute and &amp;#167; 2(b), since the statute did not apply
         to any allowance protected by federal law. In our opinion, it is not necessary to decide
         whether the &amp;#167; 2(b) defense would apply in the second situation, for even assuming
         that it does, there is no conflict between the Maryland statute and the Robinson-Patman Act
         sufficient to require pre-emption.</p>


      <span class="num">19</span>
      <p>Appellants' first argument is that compliance with the Maryland statute may cause them to
         violate the Robinson-Patman Act. They stress the possibility that the requirement that a
         price reduction be made on a statewide basis may result in discrimination between customers
         who would otherwise receive the same price, and they describe various hypothetical
         situations to illustrate this point.<a class="footnote" href="#fn21" id="fn21_ref">21</a>

         </span> (1961). The Court in Seagram &amp;amp; Sons went on to say that [a]lthough it is
         possible to envision circumstances under which price discriminations proscribed by the
         Robinson-Patman Act might be compelled by [the state statute], the existence of such
         potential conflicts is entirely too speculative in the present posture of this case" to
         warrant pre-emption. 384 U.S., at 46, 86 S.Ct., at 1261. That counsel of restraint applies
         with even greater force here. For even if we were to delve into the hypothetical situations
         posed by appellants, we would not be presented with a state statute that requires a
         violation of the Robinson-Patman Act. Instead, the alleged "conflict" here is in the
         possibility that the Maryland statute may require uniformity in some situations in which
         the Robinson-Patman Act would permit localized discrimination.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn22" id="fn22_ref">22</a> This sort of hypothetical conflict is not sufficient
         to warrant pre-emption.</p>


      <span class="num">20</span>
      <p>Appellants, however, also claim that the Robinson-Patman Act does not simply permit
         localized discrimination, but actually establishes a federal right to engage in
         discriminatory pricing in certain situations. They argue that this federal right may be
         found directly in &amp;#167; 2(b), or, more generally, in our Nation's basic policy
         favoring competition as reflected in the Sherman Act as well as &amp;#167; 2(b). We find
         neither argument persuasive.</p>


      <span class="num">21</span>
      <p>The proviso in &amp;#167; 2(b) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act,
         is merely an exception to that statute's broad prohibition against discriminatory pricing.
         It created no new federal right; quite the contrary, it defined a specific, limited
         defense, and even narrowed the good-faith defense that had previously existed.<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn23" id="fn23_ref">23</a> To be sure, the defense is an
         important one, and the interpretation of its contours has been informed by the underlying
         national policy favoring competition which it reflects.<a class="footnote" href="#fn24"
            id="fn24_ref">24</a> But it is illogical to infer that by excluding certain competitive
         behavior from the general ban against discriminatory pricing, Congress intended to pre-empt
         the States' power to prohibit any conduct within that exclusion. This Court is generally
         reluctant to infer pre-emption, see, e. g., De Canas v. Bica, <span class="citation">

         to do so in this case because the basic purposes of the state statute and the
         Robinson-Patman Act are similar. Both reflect a policy choice favoring the interest in

      <p>Appellants point out that the Robinson-Patman Act itself may be characterized as an
         exception to, or a qualification of, the more basic national policy favoring free
            competition,<a class="footnote" href="#fn26" id="fn26_ref">26</a> and argue that the

         Robinson-Patman and Sherman Acts.<a class="footnote" href="#fn27" id="fn27_ref">27</a> This
         is merely another way of stating that the Maryland statute will have an anticompetitive
         effect. In this sense, there is a conflict between the statute and the central policy of
         the Sherman Act&amp;#8212;our "charter of economic liberty." Northern Pacific R. Co. v.

         adverse effect on competition were, in and of itself, enough to render a state statute

         antitrust policy, I dissent from Part III of the Court's opinion because it fails to
         condemn impermissible discrimination against interstate commerce in retail gasoline
         marketing. The divestiture provisions, Md.Code Ann., Art. 56, &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 157E(b)
         and (c) (Supp.1977) (hereinafter referred to as &amp;#167;&amp;#167; (b) and (c)), preclude
         out-of-state competitors from retailing gasoline within Maryland. The effect is to protect
         in-state retail service station dealers from the competition of the out-of-state
         businesses. This protectionist discrimination is not justified by any legitimate state
         interest that cannot be vindicated by more evenhanded regulation. Sections (b) and (c),
         therefore, violate the Commerce Clause.<a class="footnote" href="#fn2-1" id="fn2-1_ref"

      <p>* In Maryland the retail marketing of gasoline is interstate commerce, for all petroleum
         products come from outside the State. Retailers serve interstate travelers. To the extent
         that particular retailers succeed or fail in their businesses, the interstate wholesale
         market for petroleum products is affected. Cf. Dean Milk Co. v. Madison, <span

      <p>The Commerce Clause forbids discrimination against interstate commerce, which repeatedly
         has been held to mean that States and localities may not discriminate against the

         </span>, 455-456, 61 S.Ct. 334, 335, 85 L.Ed. 275 (1940). The discrimination need not
         appear on the face of the state or local regulation. "The commerce clau e forbids
         discrimination, whether forthright or ingenious. In each case it is our duty to determine
         whether the statute under attack, whatever its name may be, will in its practical operation
         work discrimination against interstate commerce." Ibid. (footnote omitted). The state or
         local authority need not intend to discriminate in order to offend the policy of
         maintaining a free-flowing national economy. As demonstrated in Hunt, a statute that on its
         face restricts both intrastate and interstate transactions may violate the Clause by having
         the "practical effect" of discriminating in its operation. 432 U.S., at 350-352, 97 S.Ct.,
         at 2434-2445.</p>


      <span class="num">30</span>
      <p>If discrimination results from a statute, the burden falls upon the state or local
         government to demonstrate legitimate local benefits justifying the inequality and to show
         that less discriminatory alternatives cannot protect the local interests. Id., at 353, 97
         S.Ct., at 2446; Dean Milk Co. v. Madison, 340 U.S., at 354, 71 S.Ct., at 297. This Court
         does not merely accept without analysis purported local interests. Instead, it
         independently identifies the character of the interests and judges for itself whether
         alternatives will be adequate. For example, in Dean Milk the city attempted to justify a
         milk pasteurization ordinance by claiming it to be a necessary health measure. The city's
         assertion was not conclusive, however:</p>


      <span class="num">31</span>
      <p>"A different view, that the ordinance is valid simply because it professes to be a health
         measure, would mean that the Commerce Clause of itself imposes no limitations on state
         action other than those laid down by the Due Process Clause, save for the rare instance
         where a state artlessly discloses an avowed purpose to discriminate against interstate
         goods." Ibid.</p>


      <span class="num">32</span>
      <p>In an independent assessment of the asserted purpose, the Court determined exactly how the
         ordinance protected public health and then concluded that other measures could accomplish
         the same ends. Id., at 354-356, 71 S.Ct., at 297-298. The city's public health purpose
         therefore did not justify the discrimination, and the ordinance violated the Commerce
         Clause.</p>

      <p>B</p>

      <span class="num">33</span>
      <p>With this background, the unconstitutional discrimination in the Maryland statute becomes
         apparent. No facial inequality exists; &amp;#167;&amp;#167; (b) and (c) preclude all
         refiners and producers from marketing gasoline at the retail level. But given the structure
         of the retail gasoline market in Maryland, the effect of &amp;#167;&amp;#167; (b) and (c)
         is to exclude a class of predominantly out-of-state gasoline retailers while providing
         protection from competition to a class of nonintegrated retailers that is overwhelmingly
         composed of local businessmen. In 1974, of the 3,780 gasoline service stations in the
         State, 3,547 were operated by nonintegrated local retail dealers. App. 191, 569, 755. Of
         the 233 company-operated stations, 197 belonged to out-ofstate integrated producers or
         refiners. Id., at 190-191. Thirty-four were operated by nonintegrated companies that would
         not have been affected immediately by the Maryland statute.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn5-1" id="fn5-1_ref">5</a> Ibid. The only in-state integrated petroleum firm,
         Crown Central Petroleum, Inc., operated just two service stations. Id., at 189. Of the
         class of stations statutorily insulated from the competition of the out-of-state integrated
         firms, then, more than 99% were operated by local business interests. Of the class of
         enterprises excluded entirely from participation in the retail gasoline market, 95% were
         out-of-state firms, operating 98% of the stations in the class. Ibid.</p>


      <span class="num">34</span>
      <p>The discrimination suffered by the out-of-state integrated producers and refiners is
         significant. Five of the excluded enterprises, Ashland Oil, Inc., BP Oil, Inc., Kayo Oil
         Co., Petroleum Marketing Corp., and Southern States Cooperative, Inc., market nonbranded
         gasoline through price competition rather than through brand recognition. Of the 98
         stations marketing gasoline in this manner, all but 6 are company operated. The company
         operations result from the dominant fact of price competition marketing. According to
         repeated testimony from petroleum economics experts and officers of price
         marketers&amp;#8212;testimony that the trial court did not discredit&amp;#8212;such
         nonbranded stations can compete successfully only if they have day-to-day control of the
         retail price of their products, the hours of operation of their stations, and related
         business details. App. 320, 357, 370-371, 449-451, 503-504, 517, 529-530; Joint App. to
         Jurisdictional Statements 102a et seq. Only with such control can sufficient sales volume
         be achieved to produce satisfactory profits at prices two to three cents a gallon below
         those of the major branded stations. Dealer operation of stations precludes such control
         because of the illegality of vertical price fixing. See, e. g., 15 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1
         (1976 ed.); White Motor Co. v. United States, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/xEW/white-motor-co-v-united-states/">

            </a>
         </span>, 83 S.Ct. 696, 9 L.Ed.2d 738 (1963). Therefore, because &amp;#167;&amp;#167; (b)
         and (c) forbid company operations, these out-of-state competitors will have to abandon the
         Maryland retail market altogether. App. 100, 357-358, 455, 519; Joint App. to
         Jurisdictional Statements 103a et seq.<a class="footnote" href="#fn6-1" id="fn6-1_ref"
            >6</a> For the same reason 32 other out-of-state national nonbranded integrated
         marketers, who operate their own stations without dealers, will be precluded from entering
         the Maryland retail gasoline market.</p>


      <span class="num">35</span>
      <p>The record also contains testimony that the discrimination will burden the operations of
         major branded companies, such as appellants Exxon, Phillips, Shell, and Gulf, all of which
         are out-of-state firms. Most importantly, &amp;#167;&amp;#167; (b) and (c) will preclude
         these companies, as well as those mentioned in the previous paragraph, from competing
         directly for the profits of retail marketing. According to Richard T. Harvin, retail sales
         manager for Exxon's eastern marketing region, Exxon's company-operated stations in Maryland
         annually return 15% of the company's investment&amp;#8212;a profit of $700,000 in 1974.
         App. 316. Sections (b) and (c) will force this return to be shared with the local dealers.
         In addition, the ban of the sections will preclude the majors from enhancing brand
         recognition and consumer acceptance through retail outlets with company-controlled
         standards. Id., at 316, 320, 647, 668-669. Their ability directly to monitor consumer
         preferences and reactions will be diminished. Id., at 315, 649, 669. And their opportunity
         for experimentation with retail marketing techniques will be curtailed. Id., at 316-317,
         647-649, 669. In short, the divestiture provisions, which will require the appellant majors
         to cease operation of property valued at more than $10 million, will inflict significant
         economic hardship on Maryland's major brand companies, all of which are out-of-state
         firms.</p>


      <span class="num">36</span>
      <p>Similar hardship is not imposed upon the local service station dealers by the divestiture
         provisions. Indeed, rather than restricting their ability to compete, the Maryland Act
         effectively and perhaps intentionally improves their competitive position by insulating
         them from competition by out-of-state integrated producers and refiners. In ts answers to
         the various complaints in this case, the State repeatedly conceded that the Act was
         intended to protect "the retail dealer as an independent businessman [by] reducing the
         control and dominance of the vertically integrated petroleum producer and refiner in the
         retail market." Id., at 33; see id., at 51, 54, 104, 128, 132, 145, 147. At trial the
         State's expert said that the legislation would have the effect of protecting the local
         dealers against the out-of-state competition. Id., at 613. In short, the foundation of the
         discrimination in this case is that the local dealers may continue to enter retail
         transactions and to compete for retail profits while the statute will deny similar
         opportunities to the class composed almost entirely of out-of-state businesses.<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn7-1" id="fn7-1_ref">7</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">37</span>
      <p>With discrimination proved against interstate commerce, the burden falls upon the State to
         justify the distinction with legitimate state interests that cannot be vindicated with more
         evenhanded regulation. On the record before the Court, the State fails to carry its burden.
         It asserts only in general terms a desire to maintain competition in gasoline retailing.
         Although this is a laudable goal, it cannot be accepted without further analysis, just as
         the Court could not accept the mere assertion of a public health justification in Dean
         Milk. Here, the State ignores the second half of its responsibility; it does not even
         attempt to demonstrate why competition cannot be preserved without banning the out-of-state
         interests from the retail market.</p>


      <span class="num">38</span>
      <p>The State's showing may be so meager because any legitimate interest in competition can be
         vindicated with more evenhanded regulation. First, to the extent that the State's interest
         in competition is nothing more than a desire to protect particular
         competitors&amp;#8212;less efficient local businessmen&amp;#8212;from the legal competition
         of more efficient out-of-state firms, the interest is illegitimate under the Commerce
         Clause. A national economy would hardly flourish if each State could effectively insist
         that local nonintegrated dealers handle product retailing to the exclusion of out-of-state
         integrated firms that would have sufficient local political clout to challenge the
         influence of local businessmen with their local government leaders.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn8-1" id="fn8-1_ref">8</a> Each State would be encouraged to "legislate
         according to its estimate of its own interests, the importance of its own products, and the
         local advantages or disadvantages of its position in a political or commercial view." J.

         7, 11, 12 (Hamilton), No. 42 (Madison). The Commerce Clause simply does not countenance
         such parochialism.</p>


      <span class="num">39</span>
      <p>Second, a legitimate concern of the State could be to limit the economic power of vertical
         integration. But nothing in the record suggests that the vertical integration that has
         already occurred in the Maryland petroleum market has inhibited competition. Indeed, the
         trial court found that the retail market, dominated by 3,547 dealer outlets constituting
         more than 90% of the State's service stations, is high competitive.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn9-1" id="fn9-1_ref">9</a> Therefore, the State has shown no need for the
         divestiture of existing company-owned stations required by &amp;#167; (c). The legitimacy
         of any concern about future integration, which could support the discrimination of
         &amp;#167; (b), is suspect because of the exemption granted wholesalers, which, not
         surprisingly, are local businesses able to influence the state legislature.<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn10-1" id="fn10-1_ref">10</a> See n. 7, supra.</p>


      <span class="num">40</span>
      <p>Third, the State appears to be concerned about unfair competitive behavior such as
         predatory pricing or inequitable allocation of petroleum products by the integrated firms.
         These are the only examples of specific misconduct asserted in the State's answers. App.
         33-34, 54-55, 81-83, 109-111, 133-134, 148-149. But none of the concerns support the
         discrimination in &amp;#167;&amp;#167; (b) and (c). There is no proof in the record that
         any significant portion of the class of out-of-state firms burdened by the divestiture
         sections has engaged in such misconduct. Furthermore, predatory pricing and unfair
         allocation already have been prohibited by both state and federal law. See, e. g.,
         Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, 87 Stat. 628, 15 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 751 et seq.
         (1976 ed.); Energy Policy and Conservation Act, &amp;#167; 461, 89 Stat. 955, 15 U.S.C.

         refiners, could prevent whatever evils arise from shortterm leases. Cf. Maryland Gasoline

      <span class="num">41</span>
      <p>In sum, the State has asserted before this Court only a vague interest in preserving
         competition in its retail gasoline market. It has not shown why its interest cannot be
         vindicated by legislation less discriminatory toward out-of-state retailers. It therefore
         has not met its burden to justify the discrimination inherent in &amp;#167;&amp;#167; (b)
         and (c), and they violate the Commerce Clause.</p>

      <p>II</p>

      <span class="num">42</span>
      <p>The arguments of the Court's opinion, the Maryland Court of Appeals decision,<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn12-1" id="fn12-1_ref">12</a> and appellees do not remove the
         unconstitutional taint from the discrimination inherent in &amp;#167;&amp;#167; (b) and
         (c).</p>


      <span class="num">43</span>
      <p>* The Court offers essentially three responses to the discrimination in the retail gasoline
         market imposed by the divestiture provisions.<a class="footnote" href="#fn13-1"
            id="fn13-1_ref">13</a> First, the Court says that the discrimination against the class
         of out-of-state producers and refiners does not violate the Commerce Clause because the
         State has not imposed similar discrimination against other out-of-state retailers. Ante, at
         125-126. This is said to distinguish the present case from Hunt v. Washington Apple
         Advertising Comm'n, supra. In fact, however, the unconstitutional discrimination in Hunt
         was not against all out-of-state interests. North Carolina had enacted a statute requiring
         that apples marketed in closed containers within the State bear " 'no grade other than the
         applicable U.S. grade or standard.' " 432 U.S., at 335, 97 S.Ct., at 2437. The Commission
         contended that the provision discriminated against interstate commerce because it
         prohibited the display of superior Washington State apple grading marks. The Court did not
         strike down the provision because it discriminated against the marketing techniques of all
         out-of-state growers. The provision imposed no discrimination on growers from States that
         employed only the United States Department of Agriculture grading system.<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn14-1" id="fn14-1_ref">14</a> Despite this lack of universal
         discrimination, the Court declared the provision unconstitutional because it discriminated
         against a single segment of out-of-state marketers of apples, namely the Washington State
         growers who employed the superior grading system. In this regard, the Maryland divestiture
         provisions are identical to, not distinguishable from, the North Carolina statute in Hunt.
         Here, the discrimination has been imposed against a segment of the out-of-state retailers
         of gasoline, namely, those who also refine or produce petroleum.</p>


      <span class="num">44</span>
      <p>To accept the argument of the Court, that is, that discrimination must be universal to
         offend the Commerce Clause, naively will foster protectionist discrimination against
         interstate commerce. In the future, States will be able to insulate in-state interests from
         competition by identifying the most potent segments of out-of-state business, banning them,
         and permitting less effective out-of-state actors to remain. The record shows that the
         Court permits Maryland to effect just such discrimination in this case. The State bans the
         most powerful out-of-state firms from retailing gasoline within its boundaries. It then
         insulates the forced divestiture of 199 service stations from constitutional attack by
         permitting out-of-state firms such as Pantry Pride, Fisca, Hi-Way, and Midway to continue
         to operate 34 gasoline stations. Effective out-of-state competition is thereby
         emasculated&amp;#8212;no doubt, an ingenious discrimination. But as stated at the outset,
         "the commerce clause forbids discrimination, whether forthright or ingenious." Best
         &amp;amp; Co. v. Maxwell, 311 U.S., at 455, 61 S.Ct., at 335.</p>


      <span class="num">45</span>
      <p>Second, the Court contends, as a subpart of its primary argument, that the discrimination
         in Hunt "raised the cost of doing business for out-of-state dealers, and, in various other
         ways, favored the in-state dealer in the local market. 432 U.S., at 351-352, 97 S.Ct., at
         2445-2446. No comparable claim can be made here." Ante, at 126. Once it is seen that the
         discrimination in Hunt raised the cost of doing business for only one group of the
         out-of-state marketers of apples, the fallacy of the Court's argument appears. In fact,
         here the burden imposed upon the class of out-of-state retailers subject to the
         discrimination of &amp;#167;&amp;#167; (b) and (c) far exceeds the burdens in Hunt. In Hunt
         the statute merely increased costs and deprived the Washington growers of the competitive
         advantages of the use of their grading system. Here, the statute bans the refiners and
         producers from the retail market altogether&amp;#8212;a burden that lacks comparability
         with the effects in Hunt only because it is more severe.</p>


      <span class="num">46</span>
      <p>Third, the Court asserts without citation: "The fact that the burden of a state regulation
         falls on some interstate companies does not, by itself, establish a claim of discrimination
         against interstate commerce." Ante, at 126. This proposition is correct only to the extent
         that it is incomplete; it does not apply to the facts present here. It is true that merely
         demonstrating a burden on some out-of-state actors does not prove unconstitutional
         discrimination. But when the burden is significant, when it falls on the most numerous and
         effective group of out-of-state competitors, when a similar burden does not fall on the
         class of protected in-state businessmen, and when the State cannot justify the resulting
         disparity by showing that its legislative interests cannot be vindicated by more evenhanded
         regulation, unconstitutional discrimination exists. The facts of this litigation
         demonstrate such discrimination, and the Court does not argue persuasively to the
         contrary.</p>

      <p>B</p>

      <span class="num">47</span>
      <p>The contentions of the Maryland Court of Appeals, which also found no violation of the
         Commerce Clause, are no more convincing than the arguments of the Court's opinion. First,
         the Court of Appeals reasoned that &amp;#167;&amp;#167; (b) and (c) did not discriminate
         against the class of out-of-state refiners and producers because the wholesale flow of
         petroleum products into the State was not restricted. <span class="citation">
            <a href="/md/cBYM/governor-v-exxon-corp/">
               <span class="volume">279</span>

            </a>
         </span>, 1114 (1977). This supposedly distinguished the present facts from those of Dean
         Milk Co. v. Madison, which involved unconstitutional discrimination against interstate
         commerce. To begin with, however, the distinction drawn by the Court of Appeals is
         basically irrelevant. The Maryland statute has not effected discrimination with regard to
         the wholesaling or interstate transport of petroleum. The discrimination e ists with regard
         to retailing. The fact that gasoline will continue to flow into the State does not permit
         the State to deny out-of-state firms the opportunity to retail it once it arrives.</p>


      <span class="num">48</span>
      <p>Furthermore, Dean Milk cannot be distinguished on the ground asserted by the Court of
         Appeals. There, this Court invalidated &amp;#167; 7.21 of the General Ordinances of the
         city of Madison (1949), which outlawed the local sale of milk not pasteurized within five
         miles of the city. The section did not legally or effectively block the flow of
         out-of-state milk into Madison to any greater extent than the restrictions on sales of
         gasoline by out-of-state companies block the flow of gasoline here. In Dean Milk
         out-of-state producers could bring their milk to Madison, have it pasteurized in Madison,
         and sell it in Madison without violating &amp;#167; 7.21. If the flow of milk were at all
         restricted, it was merely because the out-of-state producers chose not to deal with the
         Madison pasteurizers. Similarly, the flow of gasoline into Maryland may be restricted if
         the out-of-state producers and refiners choose not to supply the dealers who replace the
         company-owned operations.<a class="footnote" href="#fn15-1" id="fn15-1_ref">15</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">49</span>
      <p>Second, the Court of Appeals said the Maryland legislation did not offend the Commerce
         Clause because the legislature intended to preserve competition, not to discriminate
         against interstate commerce. 279 Md., at 431, 370 A.2d, at 1114. With this argument, the
         court fell into the same trap that confines the State's proffered justifications for the
         discrimination of &amp;#167;&amp;#167; (b) and (c). To begin with, the fact that no
         discrimination was intended is irrelevant where, as here, discriminatory effects result
         from the statutory scheme. Furthermore, the fact that the legislature might have had a
         laudable intent when it passed the law cannot by itself justify the divestiture provisions.
         The State must also show that its interests cannot be vindicated by less discriminatory
         alternatives. The Court of Appeals erroneously failed to require such a showing from the
         appellees.</p>


      <span class="num">50</span>
      <p>Third, the Court of Appeals resurrected the outdated notion that retailing is merely local
         activity not subject to the strictures of the Commerce Clause. 279 Md., at 432, 370 A.2d,
         at 1114-1115, citing Crescent Oil Co. v. Mississippi, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/vFS/crescent-cotton-oil-co-v-mississippi/">
               <span class="volume">257</span>
               <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
               <span class="page">129</span>
            </a>
         </span>, 42 S.Ct. 42, 66 L.Ed. 166 (1921). In Crescent Oil the Court said that the
         operation of cotton gins was local manufacturing rather than interstate commerce. As
         explained at the beginning of Part I of this opinion, however, the interstate character of
         the retail gasoline market and 57 years of intervening constitutional and economic
         development prevent the application of Crescent Oil to the facts of this litigation. See
         nn. 3 and 4, and, accompanying text, supra.</p>

      <p>C</p>

      <span class="num">51</span>
      <p>Finally, nothing in the argument of the appellees saves the distinctions in
         &amp;#167;&amp;#167; (b) and (c) from the taint of unconstitutionality. First, the State
         argues that discrimination against interstate commerce has not occurred because [n]o nexus
         between interstate as opposed to local interests inheres in the production or refining of
         petroleum." Brief for Appellees 23. Although this statement might be correct in the
         abstract, it is incorrect in reality, given the structure of the Maryland petroleum market.
         Due to geological formation as so far known, no petroleum is produced in Maryland; due to
         the economics of production and refining, as well as to the geology, no petroleum is
         refined in Maryland. As a matter of actual fact, then, an inherent nexus does exist between
         the out-of-state status f producers and refiners and the distribution and retailing of
         gasoline in Maryland. The Commerce Clause does not forbid only legislation that
         discriminates under all factual circumstances. It forbids discrimination in effect against
         interstate commerce on the specific facts of each case. If production or refining of
         gasoline occurred in Maryland, &amp;#167;&amp;#167; (b) and (c) might not be
         unconstitutional. Under those different circumstances, however, the producers and refiners
         would have a fair opportunity to influence their local legislators and thereby to prevent
         the enactment of economically disruptive legislation. Under those circumstances, the
         economic disruption would be felt directly in Maryland, which would tend to make the local
         political processes responsive to the problems thereby created. Under those circumstances,
         &amp;#167;&amp;#167; (b) and (c) might never have been passed. In this case however, the
         economic disruption of the sections is visited upon out-of-state economic interests and not
         upon in-state businesses. One of the basic assumptions of the Commerce Clause is that local
         political systems will tend to be unresponsive to problems not felt by local constituents;
         instead, local political units are expected to act in their constituents' interests.<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn16-1" id="fn16-1_ref">16</a> One of the basic purposes of the
         Clause, therefore, is to prevent the vindication of such self-interest from unfairly
         burdening out-of-state concerns and thereby disrupting the national economy.</p>


      <span class="num">52</span>
      <p>Second, appellees argue, as did the Court of Appeals, that &amp;#167;&amp;#167; (b) and (c)
         do not discriminate impermissibly because the Maryland Legislature passed them with the
         intent to preserve competition. As explained above, however, the mere assertion of a
         laudable purpose does not carry the State's burden to justify the discriminatory effects of
         the statute. See Parts I-B and II-B, supra.</p>


      <span class="num">53</span>
      <p>Third, appellees rely upon the Court of Appeals' contention that unconstitutional
         discrimination against interstate commerce can be found only where the flow of interstate
         goods is curtailed. Appellees' assertion fares no better than did the court's because the
         appellees fail to show how the effect on the flow of interstate goods varies in kind
         between this case and Dean Milk. See Part II-B, supra.</p>

      <p>III</p>

      <span class="num">54</span>
      </div><div type="" judge=""><p>The Court's decision brings to mind the well-known words of Mr. Justice Cardozo:</p>

         must sink or swim together, and that in the long run prosperity and salvation are in union

         stations in Maryland. App. 190-191. Hudson has, however, recently acquired a refinery. See

         interstate commerce. But the Maryland statute has no impact on the relative proportions of
         local and out-of-state goods sold in Maryland and, indeed, no demonstrable effect
         whatsoever on the interstate flow of goods. The sales by independent retailers are just as
         much a part of the flow of interstate commerce as the sales made by the refiner-operated
         stations.</p>

      <a class="footnote" href="#fn21_ref">21</a>
      <p> Appellants argue that compliance with the "voluntary allowance" provision may expose them
         to both primary-line and secondary-line liability under &amp;#167; 2(a) of the Clayton Act,
         as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act. With respect to primary-line liability, they pose
         the hypothesis of a seller who responds to a competitor's lower price in Baltimore. Under
         the statute, he must lower his prices throughout the State, even though the competitive
         market justifying that price is confined to Baltimore. Appellants then argue that a
         competitor operating only in Salisbury, Md., may be injured by this price reduction. But an
         injury flowing from a uniform price reduction is not actionable under the Robinson-Patman
         Act, which only prohibits price discrimin tion. See F. Rowe, Price Discrimination Under the
         Robinson-Patman Act 93 (1962).</p>


      <a class="footnote" href="#fn22_ref">22</a>
      <p> Thus, appellants' claim that the statute will create secondary-line liability is premised
         on the possibility that price differentials may arise between stations located in Maryland
         and those in neighboring States. With respect to this claim, it is sufficient to note that,
         although the Maryland statute may affect the business decision of whether or not to reduce
         prices, it does not create any irreconcilable conflict with the Robinson-Patman Act. The
         statute may require that a voluntary allowance that could legally have been confined to the
         Baltimore area be extended to Salisbury. We may then assume, arguendo, that the
         Robinson-Patman Act could require a further extension of the allowance into the neighboring
         State. The possible scope of the voluntary allowance may, therefore, have an impact on the
         company's decision on whether or not to meet the competition in Baltimore, but the state
         statute does not in any way require discriminatory prices. See also n. 20, supra.</p>


      <a class="footnote" href="#fn23_ref">23</a>
      <p> Section 2 of the original Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730, established an absolute defense for a
         seller's reductions in price made "in good faith to meet competition . . . ." The
         legislative history of the Robinson-Patman Act shows that &amp;#167; 2(b) was intended to
         limit that broad defense. See Standard Oil Co. v. FTC, <span class="citation">

         In the Sherman and Clayton Acts, as well as in the Robinson-Patman Act, 'Congress was

         </span>, 455. We need not now reconcile, in its entirety, the economic theory which
         underlies the Robinson-Patman Act with that of the Sherman and Clayton Acts. It is enough
         to say that Congress did not seek by the Robinson-Patman Act either to abolish competition
         or so radically to curtail it that a seller would have no substantial right of self-defense
         against a price raid by a competitor." Standard Oil Co., supra, 340 U.S., at 248-249, 71

      <a class="footnote" href="#fn25_ref">25</a>
      <p> Just as the political and economic stimulus for the Robinson-Patman Act was the perceived
         need to protect independent retail stores from "chain stores," see U.S. Department of
         Justice, Report on the Robinson-Patman Act 114-124 (1977), so too the Maryland statute was
         prompted by the perceived need to protect independent retail service station dealers from
         the vertically integrated oil companies. 279 Md., at 422, 370 A.2d, at 1109.</p>


      <a class="footnote" href="#fn26_ref">26</a>
      <p> Indeed, many have argued that the Robinson-Patman Act is fundamentally anticompetitive and
         undermines the purposes of the Sherman Act. See generally U.S. Department of Justice

      <p> Appellants argue that Maryland has actually regulated beyond its boundaries, pointing to
         the possibility that they may have to extend voluntary allowances into neighboring States
         in order to avoid liability under the Robinson-Patman Act. See 21 and 22, supra. But this

         Midway Petroleum, National Oil Co., Pantry Pride, Savon Gas Stations, and Sears, Roebuck
         &amp;amp; Co. operated gasoline stations in Maryland. Because none of these organizations
         produced or refined petroleum at that time, the statute would not have restricted their
         operations. It should be noted, however, that the statute will reach any of thes firms
         deciding to integrate backwards from retailing to refining or producing. After this suit
         was filed, Hudson Oil Co. acquired a refinery and thus became another out-of-state business
         subject to the ban of &amp;#167;&amp;#167; (b) and (c). App. 518-519.</p>

      <a class="footnote" href="#fn7-1_ref">7</a>
      <p> Another indication of the discrimination against out-of-state business was the amendment
         of the original legislative proposal to exempt wholesalers of gasoline from the divestiture
         requirements. The author of the proposal intended to ban retailing by wholesalers and "not
         to discriminate against one class as to another." Id., at 568. On cross-examination he was
         asked why the exemption was enacted. He replied:</p>
      <p>"It was up to the General Assembly to make that decision. Apparently the wholesalers were
         represented at the testimony in the hearings. . . . I did hear at a later date that they
         wanted to be exempt from it because some of the wholesalers being local jobbers had no
         investment or financial activity or engagement with the producer-refiner so they wanted to
         plea upon the mercy of the committee so to speak . . . .</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>"Q. You have no information then as to why the Legislature of Maryland chose to make that
         discrimination? A. Not other than hearsay as to the general data that these men were local
         businessmen, had no definite tie in with the refinery . . . ." Id., at 568-569.</p>


      <a class="footnote" href="#fn8-1_ref">8</a>
      <p> There is support in the record for the inference that the Maryland Legislature passed the
         divestiture provisions in response to the pleas of local</p>
      <p>gasoline dealers for protection against the competition of both the price marketers and the
         major oil companies. For example, the executive director of the Greater Washington/Maryland
         Service Station Association, which represents almost 700 local Maryland dealers, testified
         before the Economic Matters Committee of the Maryland Senate:</p>
      <p>"I would like to begin by telling you gentlemen that these are desperate days for service
         station dealers. . . .</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>"Now beset by the critical gasoline supply situation, the squeeze by his landlord-supplier
         and the shrinking service and tire, battery and accessory market, the dealer is now faced
         with an even more serious problem.</p>
      <p>"That is the sinister threat of the major oil companies to complete their takeover of the
         retail-marketing of gasoline, not just to be in competition with their own branded dealers,
         but to squeeze them out and convert their stations to company operation.</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>"Our oil industry has grown beyond the borders of our country to where its American
         character has been replaced by a multinational one.</p>

         the state of Maryland, among our small businessmen to devour them? We sincerely hope
         not.</p>
      <p>"The men that you see here today are the back-bone of American small business. . . .</p>
      <p>"We are here today asking you, our own legislators to protect us from an economic giant who
         would take away our very livelihood and our children's future in its greed for greater
         profits. Please give us the protection we need to save our stations." Id., at 755, 756,
         761.</p>


      <a class="footnote" href="#fn9-1_ref">9</a>
      <p> From the facts stipulated by the parties, the trial court found:</p>
      <p>"Retail petroleum marketing in the State of Maryland is and has been a highly competitive
         industry. This is a result of the number and location of available facilities, the
         comparatively small capital costs for entering the business, the mobility of the purchaser
         at the time of purchasing the products, the relative interchangeability of one competitor's
         products with another in the mind of the consumer, the visibility of price information, and
         the many choices the consumer has in terms of prices, brands, and services offered." Joint
         App. to Jurisdictional Statements 99a.</p>
      <p>The continuing competitive nature of the Maryland gasoline market provided one basis for
         the trial court's holding that the State had not "demonstrated a real and substantial
         relation to the object sought to be attained by the means selected[;] the evidence
         presented before it indicates that the statute is inversely related to the public welfare."
         Id., at 131a-132a. The trial court therefore considered the statute unconstitutional.</p>


      <a class="footnote" href="#fn10-1_ref">10</a>
      <p> The trial court entered several findings about the integration of the oil companies and
         the need for divestiture:</p>
      <p>"Apart from restraining free competition, it was shown that divestiture would be harmful to
         competition in the industry, and would primarily serve to protect the independent dealers
         rather han the public at large. There was no proven detrimental effect upon the retail
         market caused by company-owned-and-operated stations which could not be curbed by federal
         and state anti-trust laws.</p>
      <p>* * * * *</p>
      <p>"The court also finds from the preponderance of the evidence that the law will preclude all
         of some thirty-two producer-refiners not now in the State from ever entering the
         competitive market in Maryland, and vertical integration will be prohibited. Neither effect
         is in the public interest since competition is essentially for consumer benefit.</p>
      <p>"Noteworthy also is the fact that the original draft of the law included wholesalers in the
         prohibition against retail selling. The final draft of the law eliminated wholesalers, for
         the sole reason, according to Mr. Coleman, that the wholesalers requested their elimination
         from the act. There is no evidence whatsoever relative to why wholesalers should have been
         included initially, nor how the general public benefited from their exemption.</p>
      <p>"In all the more than one hundred eighty-five pounds of pleadings, motions, briefs,
         exhibits and depositions before this court, there is no concrete evidence that the act was
         justified as to the classes of operators singled out to be affected in order to promote the
         general welfare of the citizens of the State. Rather, it is apparent that the entire bill
         is designed to benefit one class of merchants to the detriment of another." Id., at
         Jurisdictional Statement 130a-131a (emphasis supplied).</p>

         discriminated against interstate commerce. It held that the statute of ended substantive
         due process, in violation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, Art. 23.</p>


      <a class="footnote" href="#fn13-1_ref">13</a>
      <p> The Court also notes that &amp;#167;&amp;#167; (b) and (c) do not discriminate against
         interstate goods and do not favor local producers and refiners. While true, the observation
         is irrelevant because it does not address the discrimination inflicted upon retail
         marketing in the State. Cf. Part II-B, infra.</p>
      <p>Footnote 16 of the Court's opinion, ante, at 126-127, suggests that unconstitutional
         discrimination does not exist unless there is an effect on the quantity of out-of-state
         goods entering a State. This is too narrow a view of the Commerce Clause. First, interstate
         commerce consists of far more than mere production of goods. It also consists of
         transactions&amp;#8212;of repeated buying and selling of both goods and services. By
         focusing exclusively on the quantity of goods, the Court limits the protection of the
         Clause to producers and handlers of goods before they enter a discriminating State. In our
         complex national economy, commercial transactions continue after the goods enter a State.
         The Court today permits a State to impose protectionist discrimination upon these later
         transactions to the detriment of out-of-state participants. Second, the Court cites no case
         in which this Court has held that a burden on the flow of goods is a prerequisite to
         establishing a case of unconstitutional discrimination against interstate commerce. Neither
         Hunt nor Dean Milk contains such a holding. In both of those cases the Court upheld the
         claims of discrimination; in neither did it say that a burden on the wholesale flow of
         goods was a necessary part of its holding. Regarding Hunt,</p>
      <p>the Court cites to 432 U.S., at 347, 97 S.Ct., at 2443, which discusses only whether the
         appellants had met the $10,000 amount-in-controversy requirement of 28 U.S.C. &amp;#167;
         1331. As explained in Part II-B, infra, this case presents a threat to the flow of gasoline
         in Maryland identical to the threat to the flow of milk in Dean Milk.</p>

      <p> Growers from 13 States marketed apples in North Carolina. Six of the States did not have
         state grading systems apart from the USDA regulations. 432 U.S., at 349, 97 S.Ct., at
         2444.</p>


      <a class="footnote" href="#fn15-1_ref">15</a>
      <p> In fact, the disruption of the flow of gasoline in this case would be greater than the
         disruption of the flow of milk in Madison. The record supports the proposition that the ban
         on company operations may so unsettle the wholesale and refining enterprises of the
         independent price marketers that they will not be able profitably to supply gasoline to the
         stations of nonintegrated retailers in Maryland. App. 504-505, 509, 531.</p>


      <a class="footnote" href="#fn16-1_ref">16</a>
      <p> Given the Nation's experience under the Articles of Confederation, the assumption is not
         an unreasonable one. At that time authority to regulate commerce rested with the States
         rather than with Congress. The pursuit by each State of the particular interests of its
         economy and constituents nearly wrecked the national economy. "The almost catastrophic
         results from this sort of situation were harmful commercial wars and reprisals at home
         among the States . . . ." P. Hartman, State Taxation of Interstate Commerce 2 (1953),
         citing, e. g., The Federalist, Nos. 7, 11, 22 (Hamilton), No. 42 (Madison).</p>
