      </span> (1973) CITY OF KENOSHA ET AL. v. BRUNO ET AL. No. 72-658. <p>Supreme Court of United
         States.</p> Argued April 18, 1973. Decided June 11, 1973. APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES
      DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN. <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*508</span> LeRoy L. Dalton, Assistant Attorney General of
         Wisconsin, argued the cause for appellants. With him on the briefs were Robert W. Warren,
         Attorney General, Michael S. Fisher, and Edward A. Krenzke.</p>
      <p>James A. Walrath argued the cause and filed a brief for appellees Sleepy's, Inc., et
         al.</p>
      <p>MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
      <p>Appellees, owners of retail liquor establishments, were holders of tavern liquor
            licenses<span class="sup">[1]</span> issued under Wisconsin law by appellants, the
         cities of Racine and Kenosha. Acting pursuant to Wis. Stat. Ann. §§ 176.05 (1), (8) (1957
         and Supp. 1973), the cities denied appellees' applications for renewal of their one-year
         licenses after holding public "legislative" hearings. Alleging, inter alia, deprivations of
         their Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process rights in such denials and, by amended
         complaints, the unconstitutionality of §§ 176.05 (1), (8), appellees brought these federal
         civil rights actions for declaratory and injunctive relief naming in each case only the
         appropriate municipality as a defendant. The District Court entered temporary restraining
         orders commanding the immediate issuance of licenses and convened a three-judge district
         court pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 2281 to rule on the constitutionality of the statutory
         licensing procedure. Thereafter, the Attorney General of Wisconsin was allowed to intervene
         as a party defendant on his own motion. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the <span
            class="star-pagination">*509</span> District Court declared the statute unconstitutional
         and enjoined its enforcement. This direct appeal followed.</p>
      <p>Under the Wisconsin local licensing scheme, the governing bodies of municipalities are
         authorized to grant liquor licenses "to such persons entitled to a license under this
         chapter as they deem proper to keep places within their respective towns, villages, or
         cities for the sale of intoxicating liquors. . . ." Wis. Stat. Ann. § 176.05 (1)
            (1957).<span class="sup">[2]</span> The statutory scheme has been interpreted by the
         Wisconsin Supreme Court to require a "legislative type of hearing wherein one is given
         notice of the hearing and a fair opportunity to state his position on the issue," in
         situations where municipalities have denied an application for renewal of a license.

         </span>, 524, 157 N. W. 2d 568, 571 (1968). Such applications may not be rejected "without
         a statement on the clerk's minutes as to the reasons for such rejection," Wis. Stat. Ann. §
         176.05 (8) (Supp. 1973),<span class="sup">[3]</span> and the state courts have certiorari
         jurisdiction to <span class="star-pagination">*510</span> review whether such refusals by
         the councils are arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory. Ruffalo v. Common Council,
         supra.</p>
      <p>In the case of the Racine denials,<span class="sup">[4]</span> it was stipulated that the
         question of the appellees' applications for licenses was referred to the License and
         Welfare Committee of the Common Council and that at public hearings conducted by that
         Committee, appellees were present and heard oral objections to the renewal of the licenses
         for their taverns.<span class="sup">[5]</span> After holding a public hearing, the Common
         Council followed the Committee's recommendation and voted to deny the applications,
         apparently because of the adverse effects on the community of nude dancing in the bars.</p>
      <p>It was also stipulated that at all meetings, all persons including appellees were given an
         opportunity to speak, but no speaker was sworn. None of the testimony was recorded and no
         verbatim transcript was made. Appellees were not advised that they could cross-examine any
         of the speakers, and they did not request <span class="star-pagination">*511</span> such an
         opportunity. And there was no advance written specification of the charges against any of
         the bars.</p>
      <p>Relying on two Seventh Circuit decisions,<span class="sup">[6]</span> the three-judge court
         (as had the single judge) held that "in light of the equitable nature of this action" it
         had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1343 (3).<span class="sup">[7]</span> Concluding
         that Racine's interest in being able to deny the renewal of liquor licenses with no other
         safeguard than a legislative hearing is "minimal," the court balanced that interest against
         that of appellees, assertedly their occupations and their investments, and determined that
         the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires municipalities to grant an
         "adversary-type hearing in which the applicant is given timely notice of the reasons urged
         for denial [of renewal of his license] and an opportunity to present, confront, and
         cross-examine witnesses under oath with a verbatim transcript." <span class="citation">

      <h2>I</h2>
      <p>Neither party to the appeal has questioned the jurisdiction of the District Court, but "it
         is the duty of this court to see to it that the jurisdiction of the [district court], which
         is defined and limited by statute, is not exceeded." Louisville &amp;amp; Nashville R. Co.
         v. Mottley, 211 U. S. 149, 152 (1908). Appellees alleged that they brought <span
            class="star-pagination">*512</span> their action under 42 U. S. C. § 1983,<span
            class="sup">[8]</span> and that the District Court therefore had jurisdiction under 28
         U. S. C. § 1343. The District Court agreed. The only defendants named in the complaints,
         however, were the municipalities of Kenosha and Racine. In considering the reach of § 1983
         in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 (1961), this Court examined the legislative history
         surrounding its enactment and said:</p> "The response of the Congress to the proposal to
      make municipalities liable for certain actions being brought within federal purview by the Act
      of April 20, 1871, was so antagonistic that we cannot believe that the word `person' was used
      in this particular Act to include them." Id., at 191. <p>The District Court relied on Schnell
         v. City of Chicago, 407 F. 2d 1084 (CA7 1969), and Adams v. City of Park Ridge, 293 F. 2d
         585 (CA7 1961), in holding that Monroe was limited to actions for damages, and that cities
         were proper defendants under § 1983 where equitable relief was sought. Adams, supra,<span
            class="sup"/>[9] in turn, relied on this Court's per curiam opinion in Holmes v. City of
         Atlanta, 350 U. S. 879 (1955). But in none of the three opinions in Holmes was the issue of
         whether or not a municipality is a "person" within the meaning of § 1983 discussed. The
         authority of that case as support for <span class="star-pagination">*513</span> the
         proposition that a city is a "person" under § 1983 where equitable relief is sought, but is
         not a "person" under the same section where damages are prayed for, is at least seriously
         weakened by the following observation in Monroe, supra, at 191 n. 50:</p> "In a few cases
      in which equitable relief has been sought, a municipality has been named, along with city
      officials, as defendant where violations of 42 U. S. C. § 1983 were alleged. See, e. g.,
      Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 319 U. S. 157; Holmes v. City of Atlanta, 350 U. S. 879. The
      question dealt with in our opinion was not raised in those cases, either by the parties or by
      the Court. Since we hold that a municipal corporation is not a `person' within the meaning of
      § 1983, no inference to the contrary can any longer be drawn from those cases." <p>We find
         nothing in the legislative history discussed in Monroe, or in the language actually used by
         Congress, to suggest that the generic word "person" in § 1983 was intended to have a
         bifurcated application to municipal corporations depending on the nature of the relief
         sought against them. Since, as the Court held in Monroe, "Congress did not undertake to
         bring municipal corporations within the ambit of" § 1983, id., at 187, they are outside of
         its ambit for purposes of equitable relief as well as for damages. The District Court was
         therefore wrong in concluding that it had jurisdiction of appellees' complaints under §
         1343.</p>
      <p>As previously noted, after the complaints had been filed and issue joined, the Attorney
         General of Wisconsin was allowed to intervene as a party defendant in the actions. The
         District Court, having concluded that it had jurisdiction to entertain the original
         complaints under § 1343, understandably did not address itself to the question of <span
            class="star-pagination">*514</span> whether the intervention of the Attorney General as
         a party would cure the jurisdictional defect which we now find to exist in appellees'
         complaints. The District Court also observed that "were not civil rights jurisdiction
         proper, each of the plaintiffs herein would be able to assert the necessary . . .
         controversy requirement of Title 28 U. S. C. § 1331." 346 F. Supp., at 50. But although
         appellees in the Racine denials alleged jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1331 as well
         as § 1343, and in each complaint there was an allegation of an investment in a tavern of at
         least $20,000, the defendant municipal corporations answered by putting the appellees to
         their proof as to the amount in controversy. Since the cases were submitted and decided on
         cross-motions for summary judgment and stipulations of fact, and no stipulation as to the
         amount in controversy was filed, we cannot say on this state of the record whether or not
         jurisdiction over the complaints was affirmatively established. See Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S.
         496, 507-508 (1939), and cases therein cited. With respect to the Kenosha denials, there
         was a stipulation as to jurisdictional amount in the proceedings before the single-judge
         District Court, and an allegation of the requisite jurisdictional amount in the amended
         complaint, which for the first time challenged the constitutional validity of the Wisconsin
         statutory licensing scheme. No answer was filed to the amended complaint prior to the entry
         of judgment by the District Court.</p>
      <p>We have had the benefit of neither briefs, arguments, nor explicit consideration by the
         District Court of the jurisdictional questions presented by the intervention of the
         Attorney General as a party, and the availability of § 1331 jurisdiction in view of the
         state of the record below. We therefore remand the case to the District Court for
         consideration of these issues.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>
         <span class="star-pagination">*515</span> II</h2>
      <p>Appellees' licenses have been neither revoked nor suspended. Their claim of deprivation of
         Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process right arises from the failure of the cities of
         Kenosha and Racine to hold full-blown adversary hearings before refusing to renew their
         one-year licenses. Our decisions last year in Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564
         (1972), and Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593 (1972), discussed the nature of "liberty"
         and "property" that is protected against denial without due process by the Fourteenth
         Amendment. The District Court did not discuss these recent cases, and it followed, in part,
         the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit which was reversed in Roth.
         It, therefore, made no evaluation of "property" or "liberty" interests which might require
         a due process hearing, or of the nature of such a hearing if it were required in the light
         of our opinions in Roth, supra, and Perry, supra.</p>
      <p>The District Court, also, did not have the benefit of this Court's decision in California
         v. LaRue, 409 U. S. 109 (1972). There we held again that while the Twenty-first Amendment
         did not abrogate a requirement of procedural due process, Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400
         U. S. 433 (1971), it did grant the States broad authority over the distribution and sale of
         liquor. We also held that regulations prohibiting the sale of liquor by the drink on
         premises where there were nude but not necessarily obscene performances were facially
         constitutional.</p>
      <p>We, therefore, direct the District Court, after addressing the issue of jurisdiction, to
         reconsider its judgment in the light of Roth, Perry, and LaRue. The judgment of the
         District Court is vacated and the cause is remanded for proceedings consistent with this
         opinion.</p>
      <p>It is so ordered.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*516</span> MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE
         MARSHALL joins, concurring.</p>
      <p>Although I join the opinion of the Court, I would add that I find unimpeachably correct the
         District Court's conclusion that appellants failed to comply with the requirements of the
         Due Process Clause in denying renewal of appellees' liquor licenses. Nevertheless, since
         the defendants named in the complaints were the municipalities of Kenosha and Racine,
         jurisdiction cannot be based on 28 U. S. C. § 1343. Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S.
         693 (1973); Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 (1961). Appellees did assert 28 U. S. C. § 1331
         as an alternative ground of jurisdiction, but I agree with the Court's conclusion that
         existence of the requisite amount in controversy is not, on this record, clearly
         established. If appellees can prove their allegation that at least $10,000 is in
         controversy, then § 1331 jurisdiction is available, Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678 (1946); cf.
         Bivens v. Six Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), and they are clearly entitled to
         relief.</p>
      <p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting in part.</p>
      <p>I have expressed my doubts in Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693, 722 (dissenting
         opinion), that our decision in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, bars equitable relief against
         a municipality. In that case the legislative history<span class="sup">[*]</span> on which
         that construction of "person" as used in 42 U. S. C. § 1983 was based related to the fear
         of mulcting municipalities with damage awards for unauthorized acts of its police officers.
         Monroe v. Pape may be read as containing dicta that a remedy by way of declaratory relief
         or by injunction is barred by § 1983 as well as suits for damages. Yet I do not think we
         should decide that question without full briefing and considered argument.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*517</span> I do, however, concur in a remand for
         reconsideration by the District Court in light of Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564,
         Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593, and California v. LaRue, 409 U. S. 109.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>APPENDIX TO OPINION OF MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, DISSENTING IN PART</h2>
      <p>The holding in Monroe v. Pape that municipalities are not subject to suits for damages
         under § 1983 was based largely on Congress' rejection of the Sherman Amendment, which would
         have provided compensation for individuals from the country, city, or parish for any damage
         caused by riots, etc. Two theories were expressed in the debates for rejecting the
         amendment.</p>
      <p>The first was the notion that civil liability for damages might destroy or paralyze local
         governments. Also, it was thought unjust that local governments (and indirectly the
         citizenry at large) should be subject to damages when they bore no responsibility. Although
         the Senate passed the amendment, Senator Stevenson stated in opposition:</p> "This
      amendment wholly ignores the municipal liability created by the omission of direct, absolute
      corporate duty. We are now, for the first time, presented with an enactment which undertakes
      to create a corporate liability for personal injury which no prudence or foresight could have
      prevented. . . . "But, Mr. President, this amendment is clearly unconstitutional. If it is
      attempted to be carried out it will destroy the municipal government of every city and the
      local government of every country where this liability is created . . . . Let a judgment be
      recovered against any of our cities in the East or West and a lien is by this amendment
      created <span class="star-pagination">*518</span> not only upon the municipal property of such
      city, but upon every dollar in the city treasury. The credit of the city, the means to
      discharge its contracts and its most solemn obligations are by the operation of this act to be
      applied to such judgment. "I have heard no reason for such a lien. If carried out to its full
      extent, it must prove utterly destructive of the State municipalities! And whence does the
      Federal Government derive its power in any manner or form to touch the revenues of the State
      governments or any of its agencies? . . ." Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 762. <p>Senators
         Casserly and Bayard expressed similar concerns. Id., at 763-764, 776.</p>
      <p>In the House, Congressman Kerr stated:</p> "There is, therefore, a total and absolute
      absence of notice, constructive or implied, within any decent limits of law or reason. And the
      bill itself is significantly silent on the subject of notice to these counties and parishes or
      cities. Under this section it is not required, before liability shall attach, that it shall be
      known that there was any intention to commit these crimes, so as to fasten liability justly
      upon the municipality. . . . It takes the property of one and gives it to another by mere
      force, without right, in the absence of guilt or knowledge . . . . " Id., at 788. <p>See also
         id., at 791 (statement of Cong. Willard). And Congressman Farnsworth was concerned that the
         amendment would "put the hand of the national Government into [local government's]
         treasury." Id., at 799.</p>
      <p>There was another strain, however. Congressman Brooks viewed the amendment as raising the
         old struggle between the Federalists and the Democrats. Id., at 790. <span
            class="star-pagination">*519</span> In the words of Congressman Poland, one of the House
         managers of the Conference Committee, "[w]ith these local subdivisions we have nothing to
         do. We can impose no duty upon them; we can impose no liability upon them in any manner
         whatever." Id., at 793. He stated further:</p> "But the enforcing a liability, existing by
      their own contract, or by a State law, in the courts, is a very widely different thing from
      devolving a new duty or liability upon them by the national Government, which has no power
      either to create or destroy them, and no power or control over them whatever. . . . ". . .
      Counties and towns are subdivisions of the State government, and exercise in a limited sphere
      and extent the powers of the State delegated to them; they are created by the State for the
      purpose of carrying out the laws and policy of the State, and are subject only to such duties
      and liabilities as State laws impose upon them." Id., at 794. <p>After the House finally had
         defeated the Sherman Amendment and the Conference substitute for the amendment, Poland
         stated:</p> "I did understand from the action and vote of the House that the House had
      solemnly decided that in their judgment Congress had no constitutional power to impose any
      obligation upon county and town organizations, the mere instrumentality for the administration
      of State law." Id., at 804. <p>See also id., at 795 (statement of Cong. Burchard), 799
         (statement of Cong. Farnsworth).</p>
      <p>To the extent that the Sherman Amendment was directed only at liability for damages and the
         devastating effect those damages might have on municipalities, it <span
            class="star-pagination">*520</span> seems that the defeat of the amendment does not
         affect the existence vel non of an equitable action. One may, of course, argue that the
         sweeping statements of Poland and others that Congress had no constitutional power (however
         defective that argument is in light of developed constitutional doctrine) to authorize any
         action against a subdivision of state government indicated a purpose to go the whole way
         and not allow even injunctive relief against a municipality. But this is a matter which the
         Court has never faced.</p>

      <p>[1] In the case of appellee Misurelli, it appears from the record that his partner was
         actually the holder of the expired license. The District Court held, however, that in
         substance his application was no different from those of the other appellees.</p>
      <p>[2] Wis. Stat. Ann. § 176.05 provides: </p>

         of acting upon such applications for license as may be presented to them on or before April
         15, and all applications for license so filed shall be granted, issued or denied not later
         than June 15 for the ensuing license year, provided that nothing shall prevent any

         as an application has been approved, a duplicate copy thereof shall be forwarded to the

      <p>[4] The Racine denials were utilized by the District Court as the basis for the main
         opinion holding the Wisconsin scheme unconstitutional and the other cases were decided on
         the basis of the main opinion. We are therefore primarily considering the factual
         background of the Racine denials in our disposition.</p>
