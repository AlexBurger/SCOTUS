      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*168</span> JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the
         Court.</p>
      <p>In this case, we consider important issues respecting the meaning and coverage of one of
         our oldest civil rights statutes, 42 U. S. C. § 1981.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>
         <span class="star-pagination">*169</span> I</h2>
      <p>Petitioner Brenda Patterson, a black woman, was employed by respondent McLean Credit Union
         as a teller and a file coordinator, commencing in May 1972. In July 1982, she was laid off.
         After the termination, petitioner commenced this action in the United States District Court
         for the Middle District of North Carolina. She alleged that respondent, in violation of 14
         Stat. 27, 42 U. S. C. § 1981, had harassed her, failed to promote her to an intermediate
         accounting clerk position, and then discharged her, all because of her race. Petitioner
         also claimed this conduct amounted to an intentional infliction of emotional distress,
         actionable under North Carolina tort law.</p>
      <p>The District Court determined that a claim for racial harassment is not actionable under §
         1981 and declined to submit <span class="star-pagination">*170</span> that part of the case
         to the jury. The jury did receive and deliberate upon petitioner's § 1981 claims based on
         alleged discrimination in her discharge and the failure to promote her, and it found for
         respondent on both claims. As for petitioner's state-law claim, the District Court directed
         a verdict for respondent on the ground that the employer's conduct did not rise to the
         level of outrageousness required to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional
         distress under applicable standards of North Carolina law.</p>
      <p>In the Court of Appeals, petitioner raised two matters which are relevant here. First, she
         challenged the District Court's refusal to submit to the jury her § 1981 claim based on
         racial harassment. Second, she argued that the District Court erred in instructing the jury
         that in order to prevail on her § 1981 claim of discriminatory failure to promote, she must
         show that she was better qualified than the white employee who she alleges was promoted in
         her stead. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 805 F. 2d 1143 (1986). On the racial harassment
         issue, the court held that, while instances of racial harassment "may implicate the terms
         and conditions of employment under Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat.
         253, 42 U. S. C. § 2000e et seq.] and of course may be probative of the discriminatory
         intent required to be shown in a § 1981 action," id., at 1145 (citation omitted), racial
         harassment itself is not cognizable under § 1981 because "racial harassment does not
         abridge the right to `make' and `enforce' contracts," id., at 1146. On the jury instruction
         issue, the court held that once respondent had advanced superior qualification as a
         legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its promotion decision, petitioner had the burden
         of persuasion to show that respondent's justification was a pretext and that she was better
         qualified than the employee who was chosen for the job. Id., at 1147.</p>
      <p>We granted certiorari to decide whether petitioner's claim of racial harassment in her
         employment is actionable under § 1981, and whether the jury instruction given by the
         District <span class="star-pagination">*171</span> Court on petitioner's § 1981 promotion
         claim was error. 484 U. S. 814 (1987). After oral argument on these issues, we requested
         the parties to brief and argue an additional question:</p> "Whether or not the
      interpretation of 42 U. S. C. § 1981 adopted by this Court in Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160
      (1976), should be reconsidered." Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 485 U. S. 617 (1988). <p>We
         now decline to overrule our decision in Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160 (1976). We hold
         further that racial harassment relating to the conditions of employment is not actionable
         under § 1981 because that provision does not apply to conduct which occurs after the
         formation of a contract and which does not interfere with the right to enforce established
         contract obligations. Finally, we hold that the District Court erred in instructing the
         jury regarding petitioner's burden in proving her discriminatory promotion claim.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>II</h2>
      <p>In Runyon, the Court considered whether § 1981 prohibits private schools from excluding
         children who are qualified for admission, solely on the basis of race. We held that § 1981
         did prohibit such conduct, noting that it was already well established in prior decisions
         that § 1981 "prohibits racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of private
         contracts." Id., at 168, citing Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U. S. 454,
         459-460 (1975); Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Assn., Inc., 410 U. S. 431, 439-440
         (1973). The arguments about whether Runyon was decided correctly in light of the language
         and history of the statute were examined and discussed with great care in our decision. It
         was recognized at the time that a strong case could be made for the view that the statute
         does not reach private conduct, see 427 U. S., at 186 (Powell, J., concurring); id., at 189
         (STEVENS, J., concurring); id., at 192 (WHITE, J., dissenting), but that view did not
         prevail. Some Members of <span class="star-pagination">*172</span> this Court believe that
         Runyon was decided incorrectly, and others consider it correct on its own footing, but the
         question before us is whether it ought now to be overturned. We conclude after reargument
         that Runyon should not be overruled, and we now reaffirm that § 1981 prohibits racial
         discrimination in the making and enforcement of private contracts.</p>
      <p>The Court has said often and with great emphasis that "the doctrine of stare decisis is of
         fundamental importance to the rule of law." Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public
         Transportation, 483 U. S. 468, 494 (1987). Although we have cautioned that "stare decisis
         is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision,"
         Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks, 398 U. S. 235, 241 (1970), it is indisputable that
         stare decisis is a basic self-governing principle within the Judicial Branch, which is
         entrusted with the sensitive and difficult task of fashioning and preserving a
         jurisprudential system that is not based upon "an arbitrary discretion." The Federalist,
         No. 78, p. 490 (H. Lodge ed. 1888) (A. Hamilton). See also Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S.
         254, 265 (1986) (stare decisis ensures that "the law will not merely change erratically"
         and "permits society to presume that bedrock principles are founded in the law rather than
         in the proclivities of individuals").</p>
      <p>Our precedents are not sacrosanct, for we have overruled prior decisions where the
         necessity and propriety of doing so has been established. See Patterson v. McLean Credit
         Union, supra, at 617-618 (citing cases). Nonetheless, we have held that "any departure from
         the doctrine of stare decisis demands special justification." Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S.
         203, 212 (1984). We have said also that the burden borne by the party advocating the
         abandonment of an established precedent is greater where the Court is asked to overrule a
         point of statutory construction. Considerations of stare decisis have special force in the
         area of statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the context of constitutional
         interpretation, the legislative power is implicated, <span class="star-pagination"
            >*173</span> and Congress remains free to alter what we have done. See, e. g., Square D
         Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc., 476 U. S. 409, 424 (1986); Illinois Brick Co.
         v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 736 (1977).</p>
      <p>We conclude, upon direct consideration of the issue, that no special justification has been
         shown for overruling Runyon. In cases where statutory precedents have been overruled, the
         primary reason for the Court's shift in position has been the intervening development of
         the law, through either the growth of judicial doctrine or further action taken by
         Congress. Where such changes have removed or weakened the conceptual underpinnings from the
         prior decision, see, e. g., Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.
         S. 477, 480-481 (1989); Andrews v. Louisville &amp;amp; Nashville R. Co., 406 U. S. 320,
         322-323 (1972), or where the later law has rendered the decision irreconcilable with
         competing legal doctrines or policies, see, e. g., Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Ct. of
         Ky., 410 U. S. 484, 497-499 (1973); Construction Laborers v. Curry, 371 U. S. 542, 552
         (1963), the Court has not hesitated to overrule an earlier decision. Our decision in Runyon
         has not been undermined by subsequent changes or development in the law.</p>
      <p>Another traditional justification for overruling a prior case is that a precedent may be a
         positive detriment to coherence and consistency in the law, either because of inherent
         confusion created by an unworkable decision, see, e. g., Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE
         Sylvania, Inc., 433 U. S. 36, 47-48 (1977); Swift &amp;amp; Co. v. Wickham, 382 U. S. 111,
         124-125 (1965), or because the decision poses a direct obstacle to the realization of
         important objectives embodied in other laws, see, e. g., Rodriguez de Quijas, supra, at
         484; Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks, supra, at 240-241. In this regard, we do not find
         Runyon to be unworkable or confusing. Respondent and various amici have urged that Runyon's
         interpretation of § 1981, as applied to contracts of employment, frustrates the objectives
         of Title VII. The argument is that <span class="star-pagination">*174</span> a substantial
         overlap in coverage between the two statutes, given the considerable differences in their
         remedial schemes, undermines Congress' detailed efforts in Title VII to resolve disputes
         about racial discrimination in private employment through conciliation rather than
         litigation as an initial matter. After examining the point with care, however, we believe
         that a sound construction of the language of § 1981 yields an interpretation which does not
         frustrate the congressional objectives in Title VII to any significant degree. See Part
         III, infra.</p>
      <p>Finally, it has sometimes been said that a precedent becomes more vulnerable as it becomes
         outdated and after being " `tested by experience, has been found to be inconsistent with
         the sense of justice or with the social welfare.' " Runyon, 427 U. S., at 191 (STEVENS, J.,
         concurring), quoting B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 149 (1921). Whatever
         the effect of this consideration may be in statutory cases, it offers no support for
         overruling Runyon. In recent decades, state and federal legislation has been enacted to
         prohibit private racial discrimination in many aspects of our society. Whether Runyon's
         interpretation of § 1981 as prohibiting racial discrimination in the making and enforcement
         of private contracts is right or wrong as an original matter, it is certain that it is not
         inconsistent with the prevailing sense of justice in this country. To the contrary, Runyon
         is entirely consistent with our society's deep commitment to the eradication of
         discrimination based on a person's race or the color of his or her skin. See Bob Jones
         University v. United States, 461 U. S. 574, 593 (1983) ("[E]very pronouncement of this
         Court and myriad Acts of Congress and Executive Orders attest a firm national policy to
         prohibit racial segregation and discrimination"); see also Brown v. Board of Education, 347
         U. S. 483 (1954); Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, 559 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting)
         ("The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his . . . <span
            class="star-pagination">*175</span> color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the
         supreme law of the land are involved").<span class="sup">[1]</span>
      </p>
      <p>We decline to overrule Runyon and acknowledge that its holding remains the governing law in
         this area.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>III</h2>
      <p>Our conclusion that we should adhere to our decision in Runyon that § 1981 applies to
         private conduct is not enough to decide this case. We must decide also whether the conduct
            <span class="star-pagination">*176</span> of which petitioner complains falls within one
         of the enumerated rights protected by § 1981.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>A</h2>
      <p>Section 1981 reads as follows:</p> "All persons within the jurisdiction of the United
      States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts,
      to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and
      proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and
      shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every
      kind, and to no other." Rev. Stat. § 1977. <p>The most obvious feature of the provision is the
         restriction of its scope to forbidding discrimination in the "mak[ing] and enforce[ment]"
         of contracts alone. Where an alleged act of discrimination does not involve the impairment
         of one of these specific rights, § 1981 provides no relief. Section 1981 cannot be
         construed as a general proscription of racial discrimination in all aspects of contract
         relations, for it expressly prohibits discrimination only in the making and enforcement of
         contracts. See also Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U. S. 409, 436 (1968) (§ 1982, the
         companion statute to § 1981, was designed "to prohibit all racial discrimination, whether
         or not under color of law, with respect to the rights enumerated therein") (emphasis
         added); Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U. S. 780, 791 (1966) ("The legislative history of the 1866
         Act clearly indicates that Congress intended to protect a limited category of rights").</p>
      <p>By its plain terms, the relevant provision in § 1981 protects two rights: "the same right .
         . . to make . . . contracts" and "the same right . . . to . . . enforce contracts." The
         first of these protections extends only to the formation of a contract, but not to problems
         that may arise later from the conditions of continuing employment. The statute prohibits,
            <span class="star-pagination">*177</span> when based on race, the refusal to enter into
         a contract with someone, as well as the offer to make a contract only on discriminatory
         terms. But the right to make contracts does not extend, as a matter of either logic or
         semantics, to conduct by the employer after the contract relation has been established,
         including breach of the terms of the contract or imposition of discriminatory working
         conditions. Such postformation conduct does not involve the right to make a contract, but
         rather implicates the performance of established contract obligations and the conditions of
         continuing employment, matters more naturally governed by state contract law and Title VII.
         See infra, at 179-180.</p>
      <p>The second of these guarantees, "the same right . . . to . . . enforce contracts . . . as
         is enjoyed by white citizens," embraces protection of a legal process, and of a right of
         access to legal process, that will address and resolve contract-law claims without regard
         to race. In this respect, it prohibits discrimination that infects the legal process in
         ways that prevent one from enforcing contract rights, by reason of his or her race, and
         this is so whether this discrimination is attributed to a statute or simply to existing
         practices. It also covers wholly private efforts to impede access to the courts or obstruct
         nonjudicial methods of adjudicating disputes about the force of binding obligations, as
         well as discrimination by private entities, such as labor unions, in enforcing the terms of
         a contract. Following this principle and consistent with our holding in Runyon that § 1981
         applies to private conduct, we have held that certain private entities such as labor
         unions, which bear explicit responsibilities to process grievances, press claims, and
         represent member in disputes over the terms of binding obligations that run from the
         employer to the employee, are subject to liability under § 1981 for racial discrimination
         in the enforcement of labor contracts. See Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 482 U. S. 656
         (1987). The right to enforce contracts does not, however, extend beyond conduct by an
         employer which impairs an employee's ability <span class="star-pagination">*178</span> to
         enforce through legal process his or her established contract rights. As JUSTICE WHITE put
         it with much force in Runyon, one cannot seriously "contend that the grant of the other
         rights enumerated in § 1981, [that is, other than the right to "make" contracts,] i. e.,
         the rights `to sue, be parties, give evidence,' and `enforce contracts' accomplishes
         anything other than the removal of legal disabilities to sue, be a party, testify or
         enforce a contract. Indeed, it is impossible to give such language any other meaning." 427
         U. S., at 195, n. 5 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis in original).</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>B</h2>
      <p>Applying these principles to the case before us, we agree with the Court of Appeals that
         petitioner's racial harassment claim is not actionable under § 1981. Petitioner has alleged
         that during her employment with respondent, she was subjected to various forms of racial
         harassment from her supervisor. As summarized by the Court of Appeals, petitioner testified
         that</p> "[her supervisor] periodically stared at her for several minutes at a time; that
      he gave her too many tasks, causing her to complain that she was under too much pressure; that
      among the tasks given her were sweeping and dusting, jobs not given to white employees. On one
      occasion, she testified, [her supervisor] told [her] that blacks are known to work slower than
      whites. According to [petitioner, her supervisor] also criticized her in staff meetings while
      not similarly criticizing white employees." 805 F. 2d, at 1145. <p>Petitioner also alleges
         that she was passed over for promotion, not offered training for higher level jobs, and
         denied wage increases, all because of her race.<span class="sup">[2]</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*179</span> With the exception perhaps of her claim that
         respondent refused to promote her to a position as an accountant, see Part IV, infra, none
         of the conduct which petitioner alleges as part of the racial harassment against her
         involves either a refusal to make a contract with her or the impairment of her ability to
         enforce her established contract rights. Rather, the conduct which petitioner labels as
         actionable racial harassment is postformation conduct by the employer relating to the terms
         and conditions of continuing employment. This is apparent from petitioner's own proposed
         jury instruction on her § 1981 racial harassment claim:</p> ". . . The plaintiff has also
      brought an action for harassment in employment against the defendant, under the same statute,
      42 USC § 1981. An employer is guilty of racial discrimination in employment where it has
      either created or condoned a substantially discriminatory work environment. An employee has a
      right to work in an environment free from racial prejudice. If the plaintiff has proven by a
      preponderance of the evidence that she was subjected to racial harassment by her manager while
      employed at the defendant, or that she was subjected to a work environment not free from
      racial prejudice which was either created or condoned by the defendant, then it would be your
      duty to find for plaintiff on this issue." 1 Record, Doc. No. 18, p. 4 (emphasis added).
         <p>Without passing on the contents of this instruction, it is plain to us that what
         petitioner is attacking are the conditions of her employment.</p>
      <p>This type of conduct, reprehensible though it be if true, is not actionable under § 1981,
         which covers only conduct at the initial formation of the contract and conduct which
         impairs the right to enforce contract obligations through legal process. <span
            class="star-pagination">*180</span> Rather, such conduct is actionable under the more
         expansive reach of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The latter statute makes it
         unlawful for an employer to "discriminate against any individual with respect to his
         compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." 42 U. S. C. § 2000e-2(a)(1).
         Racial harassment in the course of employment is actionable under Title VII's prohibition
         against discrimination in the "terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." "[T]he
         [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)] has long recognized that harassment on the
         basis of race . . . is an unlawful employment practice in violation of § 703 of Title VII
         of the Civil Rights Act." See 2 EEOC Compliance Manual § 615.7 (1982). While this Court has
         not yet had the opportunity to pass directly upon this interpretation of Title VII, the
         lower federal courts have uniformly upheld this view,<span class="sup">[3]</span> and we
         implicitly have approved it in a recent decision concerning sexual harassment, Meritor
         Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 65-66 (1986). As we said in that case, "harassment
         [which is] sufficiently severe or pervasive `to alter the conditions of [the victim's]
         employment and create an abusive working environment,' " id., at 67 (citation omitted), is
         actionable under Title VII because it "affects a `term, condition, or privilege' of
         employment," ibid.</p>
      <p>Interpreting § 1981 to cover postformation conduct unrelated to an employee's right to
         enforce his or her contract, such as incidents relating to the conditions of employment, is
         not only inconsistent with that statute's limitation to the making and enforcement of
         contracts, but would also undermine the detailed and well-crafted procedures for
         conciliation and resolution of Title VII claims. In Title VII, Congress set up an elaborate
         administrative procedure, implemented through the EEOC, that is designed to assist in the
         investigation <span class="star-pagination">*181</span> of claims of racial discrimination
         in the workplace and to work towards the resolution of these claims through conciliation
         rather than litigation. See 42 U. S. C. § 2000e-5(b). Only after these procedures have been
         exhausted, and the plaintiff has obtained a "right to sue" letter from the EEOC, may he or
         she bring a Title VII action in court. See 42 U. S. C. § 2000e-5(f)(1). Section 1981, by
         contrast, provides no administrative review or opportunity for conciliation.</p>
      <p>Where conduct is covered by both § 1981 and Title VII, the detailed procedures of Title VII
         are rendered a dead letter, as the plaintiff is free to pursue a claim by bringing suit
         under § 1981 without resort to those statutory prerequisites. We agree that, after Runyon,
         there is some necessary overlap between Title VII and § 1981, and that where the statutes
         do in fact overlap we are not at liberty "to infer any positive preference for one over the
         other." Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U. S., at 461. We should be reluctant,
         however, to read an earlier statute broadly where the result is to circumvent the detailed
         remedial scheme constructed in a later statute. See United States v. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439
         (1988). That egregious racial harassment of employees is forbidden by a clearly applicable
         law (Title VII), moreover, should lessen the temptation for this Court to twist the
         interpretation of another statute (§ 1981) to cover the same conduct. In the particular
         case before us, we do not know for certain why petitioner chose to pursue only remedies
         under § 1981, and not under Title VII. See 805 F. 2d, at 1144, n.; Tr. of Oral Arg. 15-16,
         23 (Feb. 29, 1988). But in any event, the availability of the latter statute should deter
         us from a tortuous construction of the former statute to cover this type of claim.</p>
      <p>By reading § 1981 not as a general proscription of racial discrimination in all aspects of
         contract relations, but as limited to the enumerated rights within its express protection,
         specifically the right to make and enforce contracts, we may preserve the integrity of
         Title VII's procedures without sacrificing <span class="star-pagination">*182</span> any
         significant coverage of the civil rights laws.<span class="sup">[4]</span> Of course, some
         overlap will remain between the two statutes: specifically, a refusal to enter into an
         employment contract on the basis of race. Such a claim would be actionable under Title VII
         as a "refus[al] to hire" based on race, 42 U. S. C. § 2000e-2(a), and under § 1981 as an
         impairment of "the same right . . . to make . . . contracts . . . as . . . white citizens,"
         42 U. S. C. § 1981. But this is precisely where it would make sense for Congress to provide
         for the overlap. At this stage of the employee-employer relation Title VII's mediation and
         conciliation procedures would be of minimal effect, for there is not yet a relation to
         salvage.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>C</h2>
      <p>The Solicitor General and JUSTICE BRENNAN offer two alternative interpretations of § 1981.
         The Solicitor General argues that the language of § 1981, especially the words "the same
         right," requires us to look outside § 1981 to the terms of particular contracts and to
         state law for the obligations and covenants to be protected by the federal statute. Under
         this view, § 1981 has no actual substantive content, but instead mirrors only the specific
         protections that are afforded under the law of contracts of each State. Under this view,
         racial harassment in the conditions of employment is actionable when, and only when, it
         amounts to a breach of contract under state law. We disagree. For one thing, to the extent
         that it assumes that prohibitions contained in § 1981 incorporate only those protections
         afforded by the States, this theory is directly inconsistent with Runyon, which we today
            <span class="star-pagination">*183</span> decline to overrule. A more fundamental
         failing in the Solicitor's argument is that racial harassment amounting to breach of
         contract, like racial harassment alone, impairs neither the right to make nor the right to
         enforce a contract. It is plain that the former right is not implicated directly by an
         employer's breach in the performance of obligations under a contract already formed. Nor is
         it correct to say that racial harassment amounting to a breach of contract impairs an
         employee's right to enforce his contract. To the contrary, conduct amounting to a breach of
         contract under state law is precisely what the language of § 1981 does not cover. That is
         because, in such a case, provided that plaintiff's access to state court or any other
         dispute resolution process has not been impaired by either the State or a private actor,
         see Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 482 U. S. 656 (1987), the plaintiff is free to enforce the
         terms of the contract in state court, and cannot possibly assert, by reason of the breach
         alone, that he has been deprived of the same right to enforce contracts as is enjoyed by
         white citizens.</p>
      <p>In addition, interpreting § 1981 to cover racial harassment amounting to a breach of
         contract would federalize all state-law claims for breach of contract where racial animus
         is alleged, since § 1981 covers all types of contracts, not just employment contracts.
         Although we must do so when Congress plainly directs, as a rule we should be and are
         "reluctant to federalize" matters traditionally covered by state common law. Santa Fe
         Industries, Inc. v. Green, 430 U. S. 462, 479 (1977); see also Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex
         Co., 473 U. S. 479, 507 (1985) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). By confining § 1981 to the
         impairment of the specific rights to make and enforce contracts, Congress cannot be said to
         have intended such a result with respect to breach of contract claims. It would be no small
         paradox, moreover, that under the interpretation of § 1981 offered by the Solicitor
         General, the more a State extends its own contract law to protect employees in general and
         minorities in particular, the greater <span class="star-pagination">*184</span> would be
         the potential displacement of state law by § 1981. We do not think § 1981 need be read to
         produce such a peculiar result.</p>
      <p>JUSTICE BRENNAN, for his part, would hold that racial harassment is actionable under § 1981
         when "the acts constituting harassment [are] sufficiently severe or pervasive as
         effectively to belie any claim that the contract was entered into in a racially neutral
         manner." See post, at 208. We do not find this standard an accurate or useful articulation
         of which contract claims are actionable under § 1981 and which are not. The fact that
         racial harassment is "severe or pervasive" does not by magic transform a challenge to the
         conditions of employment, not actionable under § 1981, into a viable challenge to the
         employer's refusal to make a contract. We agree that racial harassment may be used as
         evidence that a divergence in the explicit terms of particular contracts is explained by
         racial animus.<span class="sup">[5]</span> Thus, for example, if a potential employee is
         offered (and accepts) a contract to do a job for less money than others doing like work,
         evidence of racial harassment in the workplace may show that the employer, at the time of
         formation, was unwilling to enter into a nondiscriminatory contract. However, and this is
         the critical point, the question under § 1981 remains whether the employer, at the time of
         the formation of the contract, in fact intentionally refused to enter into a contract with
         the employee on racially neutral terms. The plaintiff's ability to plead that the racial
         harassment is "severe or pervasive" should not allow him to boot-strap a challenge to the
         conditions of employment (actionable, if at all, under Title VII) into a claim under § 1981
         that the employer refused to offer petitioner the "same right . . . to make" a contract. We
         think it clear that the conduct challenged by petitioner relates not to her employer's
         refusal to <span class="star-pagination">*185</span> enter into a contract with her, but
         rather to the conditions of her employment.<span class="sup">[6]</span>
      </p>
      <p/>
      <h2>IV</h2>
      <p>Petitioner's claim that respondent violated § 1981 by failing to promote her, because of
         race, to a position as an intermediate accounting clerk is a different matter. As a
         preliminary point, we note that the Court of Appeals distinguished between petitioner's
         claims of racial harassment and discriminatory promotion, stating that although the former
         did not give rise to a discrete § 1981 claim, "[c]laims of racially discriminatory. . .
         promotion go to the very existence and nature of the employment contract and thus fall
         easily within § 1981's protection." 805 F. 2d, at 1145. We think that somewhat overstates
         the case. Consistent with what we have said in Part III, supra, the question whether a
         promotion claim is actionable under § 1981 depends upon whether the nature of the change in
         position was such that it involved the opportunity to enter into a new contract with the
         employer. If so, then the employer's refusal to enter the new contract is actionable under
         § 1981. In making this determination, a lower court should give a fair and natural reading
         to the statutory phrase "the same right . . . to make . . . contracts," and should not
         strain in an undue manner the language of § 1981. Only where the promotion rises to the
         level of an opportunity for a new and distinct relation between the employee and the
         employer is such a claim actionable under § 1981. Cf. Hishon v. King &amp;amp; Spaulding,
         467 U. S. 69 (1984) <span class="star-pagination">*186</span> (refusal of law firm to
         accept associate into partnership) (Title VII). Because respondent has not argued at any
         stage that petitioner's promotion claim is not cognizable under § 1981, we need not address
         the issue further here.</p>
      <p>This brings us to the question of the District Court's jury instructions on petitioner's
         promotion claim. We think the District Court erred when it instructed the jury that
         petitioner had to prove that she was better qualified than the white employee who allegedly
         received the promotion. In order to prevail under § 1981, a plaintiff must prove purposeful
         discrimination. General Building Contractors Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U. S. 375,
         391 (1982). We have developed, in analogous areas of civil rights law, a carefully designed
         framework of proof to determine, in the context of disparate treatment, the ultimate issue
         whether the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff. See Texas Dept. of
         Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248 (1981); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411
         U. S. 792 (1973). We agree with the Court of Appeals that this scheme of proof, structured
         as a "sensible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of common experience as it
         bears on the critical question of discrimination," Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters, 438
         U. S. 567, 577 (1978), should apply to claims of racial discrimination under § 1981.</p>
      <p>Although the Court of Appeals recognized that the McDonnell Douglas/Burdine scheme of proof
         should apply in § 1981 cases such as this one, it erred in describing petitioner's burden.
         Under our well-established framework, the plaintiff has the initial burden of proving, by a
         preponderance of the evidence, a prima facie case of discrimination. Burdine, 450 U. S., at
         252-253. The burden is not onerous. Id., at 253. Here, petitioner need only prove by a
         preponderance of the evidence that she applied for and was qualified for an available
         position, that she was rejected, and that after she was rejected respondent either
         continued to seek applicants for the position, or, as is alleged here, filled the position
         with a <span class="star-pagination">*187</span> white employee. See id., at 253, and n. 6;
         McDonnell Douglas, supra, at 802.<span class="sup">[7]</span>
      </p>
      <p>Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, an inference of discrimination arises.
         See Burdine, 450 U. S., at 254. In order to rebut this inference, the employer must present
         evidence that the plaintiff was rejected, or the other applicant was chosen, for a
         legitimate nondiscriminatory reason. See ibid. Here, respondent presented evidence that it
         gave the job to the white applicant because she was better qualified for the position, and
         therefore rebutted any presumption of discrimination that petitioner may have established.
         At this point, as our prior cases make clear, petitioner retains the final burden of
         persuading the jury of intentional discrimination. See id., at 256.</p>
      <p>Although petitioner retains the ultimate burden of persuasion, our cases make clear that
         she must also have the opportunity to demonstrate that respondent's proffered reasons for
         its decision were not its true reasons. Ibid. In doing so, petitioner is not limited to
         presenting evidence of a certain type. This is where the District Court erred. The evidence
         which petitioner can present in an attempt to establish that respondent's stated reasons
         are pretextual may take a variety of forms. See McDonnell Douglas, supra, at 804-805;
         Furnco Construction Corp., supra, at 578; cf. United States Postal Service Bd. of Governors
         v. Aikens, 460 U. S. 711, 714, n. 3 (1983). Indeed, she might seek to demonstrate that
         respondent's claim to have promoted a better qualified applicant was pretextual by showing
         that she was in fact <span class="star-pagination">*188</span> better qualified than the
         person chosen for the position. The District Court erred, however, in instructing the jury
         that in order to succeed petitioner was required to make such a showing. There are
         certainly other ways in which petitioner could seek to prove that respondent's reasons were
         pretextual. Thus, for example, petitioner could seek to persuade the jury that respondent
         had not offered the true reason for its promotion decision by presenting evidence of
         respondent's past treatment of petitioner, including the instances of the racial harassment
         which she alleges and respondent's failure to train her for an accounting position. See
         supra, at 178. While we do not intend to say this evidence necessarily would be sufficient
         to carry the day, it cannot be denied that it is one of the various ways in which
         petitioner might seek to prove intentional discrimination on the part of respondent. She
         may not be forced to pursue any particular means of demonstrating that respondent's stated
         reasons are pretextual. It was, therefore, error for the District Court to instruct the
         jury that petitioner could carry her burden of persuasion only by showing that she was in
         fact better qualified than the white applicant who got the job.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>V</h2>
      <p>The law now reflects society's consensus that discrimination based on the color of one's
         skin is a profound wrong of tragic dimension. Neither our words nor our decisions should be
         interpreted as signaling one inch of retreat from Congress' policy to forbid discrimination
         in the private, as well as the public, sphere. Nevertheless, in the area of private
         discrimination, to which the ordinance of the Constitution does not directly extend, our
         role is limited to interpreting what Congress may do and has done. The statute before us,
         which is only one part of Congress' extensive civil rights legislation, does not cover the
         acts of harassment alleged here.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*189A</span> In sum, we affirm the Court of Appeals'
         dismissal of petitioner's racial harassment claim as not actionable under § 1981. The Court
         of Appeals erred, however, in holding that petitioner could succeed in her discriminatory
         promotion claim under § 1981 only by proving that she was better qualified for the position
         of intermediate accounting clerk than the white employee who in fact was promoted. The
         judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore vacated insofar as it relates to petitioner's
         discriminatory promotion claim, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
         with this opinion.</p>
      <p>It is so ordered.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*189B</span> JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL and
         JUSTICE BLACKMUN join, and with whom JUSTICE STEVENS joins as to Parts II-B, II-C, and III,
         concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</p>
      <p>What the Court declines to snatch away with one hand, it takes with the other. Though the
         Court today reaffirms § 1981's applicability to private conduct, it simultaneously gives
         this landmark civil rights statute a needlessly cramped interpretation. The Court has to
         strain hard to justify this choice to confine § 1981 within the narrowest possible scope,
         selecting the most pinched reading of the phrase "same right to make a contract," ignoring
         powerful historical evidence about the Reconstruction Congress' concerns, and bolstering
         its parsimonious rendering by reference to a statute enacted nearly a century after § 1981,
         and plainly not intended to affect its reach. When it comes to deciding whether a civil
         rights statute should be construed to further our Nation's commitment to the eradication of
         racial discrimination, the Court adopts a formalistic method of interpretation antithetical
         to Congress' vision of a society in which contractual opportunities are equal. I dissent
         from the Court's holding that § 1981 does not encompass Patterson's racial harassment
         claim.</p>

         <span class="star-pagination">*190</span> I</h2>
      <p>Thirteen years ago, in deciding Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160 (1976), this Court treated
         as already "well established" the proposition that "§ 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14
         Stat. 27, 42 U. S. C. § 1981, prohibits racial discrimination in the making and enforcement
         of private contracts," as well as state-mandated inequalities, drawn along racial lines, in
         individuals' ability to make and enforce contracts. Id., at 168, citing Johnson v. Railway
         Express Agency, Inc., 421 U. S. 454 (1975); Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Assn.,
         Inc., 410 U. S. 431 (1973); and Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U. S. 409 (1968). Since
         deciding Runyon, we have upon a number of occasions treated as settled law its
         interpretation of § 1981 as extending to private discrimination. Goodman v. Lukens Steel
         Co., 482 U. S. 656 (1987); Saint Francis College v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U. S. 604 (1987);
         General Building Contractors Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U. S. 375 (1982); Delaware
         State College v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250 (1980); McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427
         U. S. 273 (1976). We have also reiterated our holding in Jones that 42 U. S. C. § 1982
         similarly applies to private discrimination in the sale or rental of real or personal
         property &#x97; a holding arrived at through an analysis of legislative history common to
         both § 1981 and § 1982. Shaare Tefila Congregation v. Cobb, 481 U. S. 615 (1987); Sullivan
         v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U. S. 229 (1969).</p>
      <p>The Court's reaffirmation of this long and consistent line of precedents establishing that
         § 1981 encompasses private discrimination is based upon its belated decision to adhere to
         the principle of stare decisis &#x97; a decision that could readily, and would better, have
         been made before the Court decided to put Runyon and its progeny into question by ordering
         reargument in this case. While there is an exception to stare decisis for precedents that
         have proved "outdated, . . . unworkable, or otherwise legitimately vulnerable to serious
            <span class="star-pagination">*191</span> reconsideration," Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.
         S. 254, 266 (1986), it has never been arguable that Runyon falls within it. Rather, Runyon
         is entirely consonant with our society's deep commitment to the eradication of
         discrimination based on a person's race or the color of her skin. See Bob Jones University
         v. United States, 461 U. S. 574, 593 (1983) ("[E]very pronouncement of this Court and
         myriad Acts of Congress and Executive Orders attest a firm national policy to prohibit
         racial segregation and discrimination"). That commitment is not bounded by legal concepts
         such as "state action," but is the product of a national consensus that racial
         discrimination is incompatible with our best conception of our communal life, and with each
         individual's rightful expectation that her full participation in the community will not be
         contingent upon her race. In the past, this Court has overruled decisions antagonistic to
         our Nation's commitment to the ideal of a society in which a person's opportunities do not
         depend on her race, e. g., Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954) (overruling
         Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896)), and I find it disturbing that the Court has in
         this case chosen to reconsider, without any request from the parties, a statutory
         construction so in harmony with that ideal.</p>
      <p>Having decided, however, to reconsider Runyon, and now to reaffirm it by appeal to stare
         decisis, the Court glosses over what are in my view two very obvious reasons for refusing
         to overrule this interpretation of § 1981: that Runyon was correctly decided, and that in
         any event Congress has ratified our construction of the statute.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>A</h2>
      <p>A survey of our cases demonstrates that the Court's interpretation of § 1981 has been based
         upon a full and considered review of the statute's language and legislative history,
         assisted by careful briefing, upon which no doubt has been cast by any new information or
         arguments advanced in the briefs filed in this case.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*192</span> In Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., supra, this
         Court considered whether § 1982, which provides that "[a]ll citizens of the United States
         shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens
         thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property,"
         prohibits private discrimination on the basis of race, and if so, whether the statute is
         constitutional. The Court held, over two dissenting votes, that § 1982 bars private, as
         well as public, racial discrimination, and that the statute was a valid exercise of
         Congress' power under § 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment to identify the badges and incidents
         of slavery and to legislate to end them.</p>
      <p>The Court began its careful analysis in Jones by noting the expansive language of § 1982,
         and observing that a black citizen denied the opportunity to purchase property as a result
         of discrimination by a private seller cannot be said to have the "same right" to purchase
         property as a white citizen. 392 U. S., at 420-421. The Court also noted that, in its
         original form, § 1982 had been part of § 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866,<span
            class="sup">[1]</span> and that § 2 of the 1866 Act provided for criminal penalties
         against any person who violated rights secured or <span class="star-pagination">*193</span>
         protected by the Act "under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom."
         392 U. S., at 424-426. This explicit limitation upon the scope of § 2, to exclude criminal
         liability for private violations of § 1, strongly suggested that § 1 itself prohibited
         private discrimination, for otherwise the limiting language of § 2 would have been
         redundant. Ibid. Although Justice Harlan, in dissent, thought a better explanation of the
         language of § 2 was that it "was carefully drafted to enforce all of the rights secured by
         § 1," id., at 454, it is by no means obvious why the dissent's view should be regarded as
         the more accurate interpretation of the structure of the 1866 Act.<span class="sup"
            >[2]</span>
      </p>
      <p>The Court then engaged in a particular thorough analysis of the legislative history of § 1
         of the 1866 Act, id., at 422-437, which had been discussed at length in the briefs of both
         parties and their amici.<span class="sup">[3]</span> While never doubting that the prime
         targets of the 1866 Act were the Black Codes, in which the Confederate States imposed
         severe disabilities on the freedmen in an effort to replicate the effects of slavery, see,
         e. g., 1 C. Fairman, Reconstruction and Reunion 1864-1888, pp. 110-117 (1971) (discussing
         Mississippi's Black Codes), the Court concluded that Congress also had intended § 1 to
         reach private discriminatory conduct. The Court cited <span class="star-pagination"
            >*194</span> a bill (S. 60) to amend the Freedmen's Bureau Act, introduced prior to the
         civil rights bill, and passed by both Houses during the 39th Congress (though it was
         eventually vetoed by President Johnson), as persuasive evidence that Congress was fully
         aware that any newly recognized rights of blacks would be as vulnerable to private as to
         state infringement. 392 U. S., at 423, and n. 30. The amendment would have extended the
         jurisdiction of the Freedmen's Bureau over all cases in the former Confederate States
         involving the denial on account of race of rights to make and enforce contracts or to
         purchase or lease property, "in consequence of any State or local law, ordinance, police,
         or other regulation, custom, or prejudice." Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 209 (1866)
         (emphasis added). When the civil rights bill was subsequently introduced, Representative
         Bingham specifically linked it in scope to S. 60. Id., at 1292. See Jones, 392 U. S., at
         424, n. 31.</p>
      <p>The Court further noted that there had been "an imposing body of evidence [before Congress]
         pointing to the mistreatment of Negroes by private individuals and unofficial groups,
         mistreatment unrelated to any hostile state legislation." Id., at 427. This evidence
         included the comprehensive report of Major General Carl Schurz on conditions in the
         Confederate States. This report stressed that laws were only part of the problem facing the
         freedmen, who also encountered private discrimination and often brutality.<span class="sup"
            >[4]</span> The congressional <span class="star-pagination">*195</span> debates on the
         Freedmen's Bureau and civil rights bills show that legislators were well aware that the
         rights of former slaves were as much endangered by private action as by legislation. See
         id., at 427-428, and nn. 37-40. To be sure, there is much emphasis in the debates on the
         evils of the Black Codes. But there are also passages that indicate that Congress intended
         to reach private discrimination that posed an equal threat to the rights of the freedmen.
         See id., at 429-437. Senator Trumbull, for example, promised to introduce a bill aimed not
         only at "local legislation," but also at any "prevailing public sentiment" that blacks in
         the South "should continue to be oppressed and in fact deprived of their freedom." <span
            class="star-pagination">*196</span> Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 77 (1866),
         quoted in Jones, supra, at 431.<span class="sup">[5]</span> In the Jones Court's view,
         which I share, Congress said enough about the injustice of private discrimination, and the
         need to end it, to show that it did indeed intend the Civil Rights Act to sweep that
         far.</p>
      <p>Because the language of both § 1981 and § 1982 appeared traceable to § 1 of the Civil
         Rights Act of 1866, the decision in Jones was naturally taken to indicate that § 1981 also
         prohibited private racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts. Thus,
         in Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Assn., Inc., 410 U. S., at 440, the Court held that
         "[i]n light of the historical interrelationship between § 1981 and § 1982," there was no
         reason to construe those sections differently as they related to a claim that a community
         swimming club denied property-linked membership preferences to blacks; and in Johnson v.
         Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U. S., at 459-460, the Court stated that "§ 1981 affords
         a federal remedy against discrimination in private employment on the basis of race." The
         Court only addressed the scope of § 1981 in any depth, however, in Runyon v. McCrary, 427
         U. S. 160 (1976), where we held that § 1981 prohibited racial discrimination in the
         admissions policy of a private school. That issue was directly presented and fully briefed
         in Runyon.<span class="sup">[6]</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*197</span> Although the Court in Runyon treated it as
         settled by Jones, Tillman, and Johnson that § 1981 prohibited private racial discrimination
         in contracting, it nevertheless discussed in detail the claim that § 1981 is narrower in
         scope than § 1982. The primary focus of disagreement between the majority in Runyon and
         JUSTICE WHITE's dissent, a debate renewed by the parties here on reargument, concerns the
         origins of § 1981. Section 1 of the 1866 Act was expressly reenacted by § 18 of the Voting
         Rights Act of 1870. Act of May 31, 1870, ch. 114, § 18, 16 Stat. 144. Section 16 of the
         1870 Act nevertheless also provided that "all persons within the jurisdiction of the United
         States shall have the same right in every State and Territory in the United States to make
         and enforce contracts . . . ." Ibid. Section 1 of the 1866 Act, as reenacted by § 18 of the
         1870 Act, was passed under Congress' Thirteenth Amendment power to identify and legislate
         against the badges and incidents of slavery, and, we held in Jones, applied to private acts
         of discrimination. The dissent in Runyon, however, argued that § 16 of the 1870 Act was
         enacted solely under Congress' Fourteenth Amendment power to prohibit States from denying
         any person the equal protection of the laws, and could have had no application to purely
         private discrimination. See Runyon, supra, at 195-201 (WHITE, J., dissenting). But see
         District of Columbia v. Carter, 409 U. S. 418, 424, n. 8 (1973) (suggesting Congress has
         the power to proscribe purely private conduct under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment). When
         all existing federal statutes were codified in the Revised Statutes of 1874, the Statutes
         included but a single provision prohibiting racial discrimination in the making and
         enforcement of contracts &#x97; § 1977, which was identical to the current § 1981. The
         Runyon dissenters believed that this provision derived solely from § 16 of the 1870 Act,
         that the analysis of § 1 in <span class="star-pagination">*198</span> Jones was of no
         application to § 1981, and that § 1981 hence could not be interpreted to prohibit private
         discrimination.</p>
      <p>The Court concluded in Runyon, however &#x97; correctly, I believe &#x97; that § 1977
         derived both from § 1 of the 1866 Act (as reenacted) and from § 16 of the 1870 Act, and
         thus was to be interpreted, in light of the decision in Jones, as applying to private
         conduct. See also General Building Contractors Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U. S., at
         390, n. 17 ("[Section] 1981, because it is derived in part from the 1866 Act, has roots in
         the Thirteenth as well as the Fourteenth Amendment"). This result followed, the Court held,
         from the terms of the 1874 revision of the statutes. The revisers who prepared the
         codification had authority only to "revise, simplify, arrange, and consolidate" existing
         laws, to omit "redundant or obsolete" provisions, and to make suggestions for repeal. Act
         of June 27, 1866, 14 Stat. 74-75. See Runyon, 427 U. S., at 168, n. 8. The revisers made no
         recommendation that § 1 of the 1866 Act, as reenacted, be repealed, and obviously the broad
         1866 provision, applying to private actors, was not made redundant or obsolete by § 16 of
         the 1870 Act, with its potentially narrower scope. Hence it is most plausible to think that
         § 1977 was a consolidation of § 1 and of § 16. Id., at 169, n. 8. The Runyon Court
         explained that a revisers' note printed alongside § 1977, indicating that it was derived
         from § 16, but not mentioning § 1 or its reenactment, had to be viewed in light of the
         terms of the codification as either inadvertent or an error, and declined "to attribute to
         Congress an intent to repeal a major piece of Reconstruction legislation on the basis of an
         unexplained omission from the revisers' marginal notes." Ibid.<span class="sup">[7]</span>
         Respondent has supplied <span class="star-pagination">*199</span> no new information
         suggesting that the Court's conclusion as to the dual origins of § 1981 was mistaken.<span
            class="sup">[8]</span> In sum, I find the careful analysis in both Jones and Runyon
         persuasive.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>
         <span class="star-pagination">*200</span> B</h2>
      <p>Even were there doubts as to the correctness of Runyon, Congress has in effect ratified our
         interpretation of § 1981, a fact to which the Court pays no attention. We have justified
         our practice of according special weight to statutory precedents, see ante, at 172-173, by
         reference to Congress' ability to correct our interpretations when we have erred. To be
         sure, the absence of legislative correction is by no means in all cases determinative, for
         where our prior interpretation of a statute was plainly a mistake, we are reluctant to "
         `place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court's own error.' " Monell v. New
         York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U. S. 658, 695 (1978), quoting Girouard v. United
         States, 328 U. S. 61, 70 (1946). Where our prior interpretation of congressional intent was
         plausible, however &#x97; which is the very least that can be said for our construction of
         § 1981 in Runyon &#x97; we have often taken Congress' subsequent inaction as probative to
         varying degrees, depending upon the circumstances, of its acquiescence. See Johnson v.
         Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County, 480 U. S. 616, 629-630, n. 7 (1987). Given the
         frequency with which Congress has in recent years acted to overturn this Court's mistaken
         interpretations of civil rights statutes,<span class="sup">[9]</span> its failure to enact
         legislation <span class="star-pagination">*201</span> to overturn Runyon appears at least
         to some extent indicative of a congressional belief that Runyon was correctly decided. It
         might likewise be considered significant that no other legislative developments have
         occurred that cast doubt on our interpretation of § 1981. Cf., e. g., Shearson/American
         Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 233-234 (1987) (regulatory developments); Monell,
         supra, at 697-699; Califano v. Sanders, 430 U. S. 99, 105-107 (1977).</p>
      <p>There is no cause, though, to consider the precise weight to attach to the fact that
         Congress has not overturned or otherwise undermined Runyon. For in this case we have more
         positive signs of Congress' views. Congress has considered and rejected an amendment that
         would have rendered § 1981 unavailable in most cases as a remedy for private employment
         discrimination, which is evidence of congressional acquiescence that is "something other
         than mere congressional silence and passivity." Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U. S. 258, 283 (1972).
         In addition, Congress has built upon our interpretation of § 1981 in enacting a statute
         that provides for the recovery of attorney's fees in § 1981 actions.</p>
      <p>After the Court's decision in Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., Congress enacted the Equal
         Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, Pub. L. 92-261, 86 Stat. 103, amending Title VII of the
         Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. § 2000e et seq. During Congress' consideration of
         this legislation &#x97; by which time there had been ample indication that § 1981 was being
            <span class="star-pagination">*202</span> interpreted to apply to private acts of
         employment discrimination<span class="sup">[10]</span> &#x97; it was suggested that Title
         VII rendered redundant the availability of a remedy for employment discrimination under
         provisions derived from the Civil Rights Act of 1866. Some concluded that Title VII should
         be made, with limited exceptions, the exclusive remedy for such discrimination. See H. R.
         Rep. No. 92-238, pp. 66-67 (1971) (minority views). Senator Hruska proposed an amendment to
         that effect. 118 Cong. Rec. 3172 (1972). Speaking for his amendment, Senator Hruska stated
         his belief that under existing law private employment discrimination would give rise to a §
         1981 claim. He complained specifically that without a provision making Title VII an
         exclusive remedy, "a black female employee [alleging] a denial of either a promotion or pay
         raise . . . because of her color," might "completely by-pass" Title VII by filing "a
         complaint in Federal court under the provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 against . .
         . the employer." Id., at 3368, 3369. In speaking against the Hruska amendment, Senator
         Williams, floor manager of the bill, stated that it was not the purpose of the bill "to
         repeal existing civil rights laws," and that to do so "would severely weaken our overall
         effort to combat the presence of employment discrimination." Id., at 3371. He referred to §
         1981 as an existing protection that should not be limited by the amendments to Title
         VII:</p> "The right of individuals to bring suits in Federal courts to redress individual
      acts of discrimination, including <span class="star-pagination">*203</span> employment
      discrimination[,] was first provided by the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1871, 42 U. S. C.
      sections 1981, 1983. It was recently stated by the Supreme Court in the case of Jones v.
      Mayer, that these acts provide fundamental constitutional guarantees. In any case, the courts
      have specifically held that title VII and the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1871 are not
      mutually exclusive, and must be read together to provide alternative means to redress
      individual grievances. "Mr. President, the amendment of [Senator Hruska] will repeal the first
      major piece of civil rights legislation in this Nation's history. We cannot do that. <p/>
      <h2>.....</h2> "The peculiarly damaging nature of employment discrimination is such that the
      individual, who is frequently forced to face a large and powerful employer, should be accorded
      every protection that the law has in its purview, and that the person should not be forced to
      seek his remedy in only one place." Id., at 3371-3372.<span class="sup">[11]</span>
      <p>The Hruska amendment failed to win passage on a tied vote, id., at 3373, and the Senate
         later defeated a motion to reconsider the amendment by a vote of 50 to 37, id., at
         3964-3965. Though the House initially adopted a similar amendment, 117 Cong. Rec. 31973,
         32111 (1971), it eventually agreed with the Senate that Title VII should not preclude other
         remedies for employment discrimination, see H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 92-899 (1972). Thus,
         Congress in 1972 assumed that § 1981 reached private discrimination, and declined to alter
         its availability as an alternative to those remedies provided by Title VII. The Court in
         Runyon properly relied upon Congress' refusal to adopt an amendment that <span
            class="star-pagination">*204</span> would have made § 1981 inapplicable to racially
         discriminatory actions by private employers, and concluded, as I do, that "[t]here could
         hardly be a clearer indication of congressional agreement with the view that § 1981 does
         reach private acts of racial discrimination." 427 U. S., at 174-175 (emphasis in
         original).</p>
      <p>Events since our decision in Runyon confirm Congress' approval of our interpretation of §
         1981. In 1976 &#x97; shortly after the decision in Runyon, and well after the Court had
         indicated in Tillman and Johnson that § 1981 prohibits private discrimination &#x97;
         Congress reacted to the ruling in Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421
         U. S. 240 (1975), that attorney's fees are not ordinarily recoverable absent statutory
         authorization, by enacting the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, Pub. L.
         94-559, 90 Stat. 2641, 42 U. S. C. § 1988. A number of civil rights statutes, like § 1981,
         did not provide for the recovery of attorney's fees, and Congress heard testimony that the
         decision in Alyeska Pipeline might have a "devastating impact" on litigation under the
         civil rights laws. H. R. Rep. No. 94-1558, p. 3 (1976). Congress responded by passing an
         Act to permit the recovery of attorney's fees in civil rights cases, including those
         brought under § 1981.</p>
      <p>Congress was well aware when it passed the 1976 Act that this Court had interpreted § 1981
         to apply to private discrimination. The House Judiciary Committee Report had expressly
         stated:</p> "Section 1981 is frequently used to challenge employment discrimination based
      on race or color. Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U. S. 454 (1975). Under that
      section the Supreme Court recently held that whites as well as blacks could bring suit
      alleging racially discriminatory employment practices. McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail
      Transportation Co. [, 427 U. S. 273 (1976)]. Section 1981 has also been cited to attack
      exclusionary admissions policies at recreational facilities. <span class="star-pagination"
         >*205</span> Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Assn., Inc., 410 U. S. 431 (1973)." Id.,
      at 4 (footnote omitted). <p>The House recognized that § 1981, thus interpreted, overlaps
         significantly with Title VII, and expressed dissatisfaction that attorney's fees should be
         available under the latter, but not the former, statute. See also S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 4
         (1976) ("[F]ees are now authorized in an employment discrimination suit brought under Title
         VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, but not in the same suit brought under 42 U. S. C. §
         1981, which protects similar rights but involves fewer technical prerequisites to the
         filing of an action"). Congress' action in providing for attorney's fees in § 1981 actions,
         intending that successful § 1981 plaintiffs who could have brought their action under Title
         VII not be deprived of fees, and knowing that this Court had interpreted § 1981 to apply to
         private discrimination, goes beyond mere acquiescence in our interpretation of § 1981.
         Congress approved and even built upon our interpretation. Overruling Runyon would be flatly
         inconsistent with this expression of congressional intent. See Bob Jones University v.
         United States, 461 U. S., at 601-602; Patsy v. Board of Regents of Florida, 457 U. S. 496,
         501 (1982); Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U. S. 469, 488 (1940).</p>

      <h2>II</h2>
      <p>I turn now to the two issues on which certiorari was originally requested and granted in
         this case. The first of these is whether a plaintiff may state a cause of action under §
         1981 based upon allegations that her employer harassed her because of her race. In my view,
         she may. The Court reaches a contrary conclusion by conducting an ahistorical analysis that
         ignores the circumstances and legislative history of § 1981. The Court reasons that Title
         VII or modern state contract law "more naturally govern[s]" harassment actions, ante, at
         177 &#x97; nowhere acknowledging the anachronism at tendant upon the implication that the
         Reconstruction Congress would have viewed state law, or a federal civil rights <span
            class="star-pagination">*206</span> statute passed nearly a century later, as the
         primary basis for challenging private discrimination.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>A</h2>
      <p>The legislative history of § 1981 &#x97; to which the Court does not advert &#x97; makes
         clear that we must not take an overly narrow view of what it means to have the "same right
         . . . to make and enforce contracts" as white citizens. The very same legislative history
         that supports our interpretation of § 1981 in Runyon also demonstrates that the 39th
         Congress intended, in the employment context, to go beyond protecting the freedmen from
         refusals to contract for their labor and from discriminatory decisions to discharge them.
         Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act was also designed to protect the freedmen from the
         imposition of working conditions that evidence an intent on the part of the employer not to
         contract on nondiscriminatory terms. See supra, at 194, and n. 4. Congress realized that,
         in the former Confederate States, employers were attempting to "adher[e], as to the
         treatment of the laborers, as much as possible to the traditions of the old system, even
         where the relations between employers and laborers had been fixed by contract." Report of
         C. Schurz, S. Exec. Doc. No. 2, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 19 (1865) (emphasis added). These
         working conditions included the use of the whip as an incentive to work harder &#x97; the
         commonplace result of an entrenched attitude that "[y]ou cannot make the negro work without
         physical compulsion," id., at 16 &#x97; and the practice of handing out severe and unequal
         punishment for perceived transgressions. See id., at 20 ("The habit [of corporal
         punishment] is so inveterate with a great many persons as to render, on the least
         provocation, the impulse to whip a negro almost irresistible"). Since such "acts of
         persecution" against employed freedmen, ibid., were one of the 39th Congress' concerns in
         enacting the Civil Rights Act, it is clear that in granting the freedmen the "same right .
         . . to make <span class="star-pagination">*207</span> and enforce contracts" as white
         citizens, Congress meant to encompass postcontractual conduct.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>B</h2>
      <p>The Court holds that § 1981, insofar as it gives an equal right to make a contract, "covers
         only conduct at the initial formation of the contract." Ante, at 179; see also ante, at
         183. This narrow interpretation is not, as the Court would have us believe, ante, at
         176-177, the inevitable result of the statutory grant of an equal right "to make
         contracts." On the contrary, the language of § 1981 is quite naturally read as extending to
         cover postformation conduct that demonstrates that the contract was not really made on
         equal terms at all. It is indeed clear that the statutory language of § 1981 imposes some
         limit upon the type of harassment claims that are cognizable under § 1981, for the
         statute's prohibition is against discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts;
         but the Court mistakes the nature of that limit.<span class="sup">[12]</span> In my view,
         harassment is properly actionable under the language of § 1981 mandating that all persons
         "shall have the same right . . . to make . . . contracts . . . as is enjoyed by white
         citizens" if it demonstrates that the employer has in <span class="star-pagination"
            >*208</span> fact imposed discriminatory terms and hence has not allowed blacks to make
         a contract on an equal basis.</p>
      <p>The question in a case in which an employee makes a § 1981 claim alleging racial harassment
         should be whether the acts constituting harassment were sufficiently severe or pervasive as
         effectively to belie any claim that the contract was entered into in a racially neutral
         manner. Where a black employee demonstrates that she has worked in conditions substantially
         different from those enjoyed by similarly situated white employees, and can show the
         necessary racial animus, a jury may infer that the black employee has not been afforded the
         same right to make an employment contract as white employees. Obviously, as respondent
         conceded at oral argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 30 (Feb. 29, 1987), if an employer offers a
         black and a white applicant for employment the same written contract, but then tells the
         black employee that her working conditions will be much worse than those of the white hired
         for the same job because "there's a lot of harassment going on in this workplace and you
         have to agree to that," it would have to be concluded that the white and black had not
         enjoyed an equal right to make a contract. I see no relevant distinction between that case
         and one in which the employer's different contractual expectations are unspoken, but become
         clear during the course of employment as the black employee is subjected to substantially
         harsher conditions than her white co-workers. In neither case can it be said that whites
         and blacks have had the same right to make an employment contract.<span class="sup"
            >[13]</span> The Court's failure to consider such examples, and to explain the abundance
         of legislative history that confounds <span class="star-pagination">*209</span> its claim
         that § 1981 unambiguously decrees the result it favors, underscore just how untenable is
         the Court's position.<span class="sup">[14]</span>
      </p>
      <p>Having reached its decision based upon a supposedly literal reading of § 1981, the Court
         goes on to suggest that its grudging interpretation of this civil rights statute has the
         benefit of not undermining Title VII. Ante, at 180-182. It is unclear how the
         interpretation of § 1981 to reach pervasive post-contractual harassment could be thought in
         any way to undermine Congress' intentions as regards Title VII. Congress has rejected an
         amendment to Title VII that would have rendered § 1981 unavailable as a remedy for
         employment discrimination, and has explicitly stated that § 1981 "protects similar rights
         [to Title VII] but involves fewer technical prerequisites to the filing of an action," see
         supra, at 205; that the Acts "provide alternative means to redress individual grievances,"
         see supra, at 203; and that an employee who is discriminated against "should be accorded
            <span class="star-pagination">*210</span> every protection that the law has in its
         purview, and . . . the person should not be forced to seek his remedy in only one place,"
         ibid. Evidently, Title VII and § 1981 provide independent remedies, and neither statute has
         a preferred status that is to guide interpretation of the other. The Court, indeed, is
         forced to concede this fact, admitting that where the statutes overlap "we are not at
         liberty `to infer any positive preference for one over the other.' " Ante, at 181. But the
         Court then goes on to say that the existence of Title VII "should lessen the temptation for
         this Court to twist the interpretation of [§ 1981] to cover the same conduct." Ibid. This,
         of course, brings us back to the question of what § 1981, properly interpreted, means. The
         Court's lengthy discussion of Title VII adds nothing to an understanding of that issue.</p>
      <p>The Court's use of Title VII is not only question begging; it is also misleading. Section
         1981 is a statute of general application, extending not just to employment contracts, but
         to all contracts. Thus we have held that it prohibits a private school from applying a
         racially discriminatory admissions policy, Runyon, and a community recreational facility
         from denying membership based on race, Tillman. The lower federal courts have found a broad
         variety of claims of contractual discrimination cognizable under § 1981. E. g., Wyatt v.
         Security Inn Food &amp;amp; Beverage, Inc., 819 F. 2d 69 (CA4 1987) (discriminatory
         application of hotel bar's policy of ejecting persons who do not order drinks); Hall v.
         Bio-Medical Application, Inc., 671 F. 2d 300 (CA8 1982) (medical facility's refusal to
         treat black person potentially cognizable under § 1981); Hall v. Pennsylvania State Police,
         570 F. 2d 86 (CA3 1978) (bank policy to offer its services on different terms dependent
         upon race); Cody v. Union Electric, 518 F. 2d 978 (CA8 1975) (discrimination with regard to
         the amount of security deposit required to obtain service); Howard Security Services, Inc.

         2d 143 (CA4), cert. denied, 398 U. S. 929 (1970). The Court, however, demonstrates no
         awareness at all that § 1981 is so much broader in scope than Title VII, instead focusing
         exclusively upon the claim that its cramped construction of § 1981 "preserve[s] the
         integrity of Title VII's procedures," ante, at 181, and avoids "[u]nnecessary overlap" that
         would "upset the delicate balance between employee and employer rights struck by Title
         VII," ante, at 182, n. 4. Rights as between an employer and employee simply are not
         involved in many § 1981 cases, and the Court's restrictive interpretation of § 1981,
         minimizing the overlap with Title VII, may also have the effect of restricting the
         availability of § 1981 as a remedy for discrimination in a host of contractual situations
         to which Title VII does not extend.</p>
      <p>Even as regards their coverage of employment discrimination, § 1981 and Title VII are quite
         different. As we have previously noted, "the remedies available under Title VII and under §
         1981, although related, and although directed to most of the same ends, are separate,
         distinct, and independent." Johnson, 421 U. S., at 461. Perhaps most important, § 1981 is
         not limited in scope to employment discrimination by businesses with 15 or more employees,
         cf. 42 U. S. C. § 2000e(b), and hence may reach the nearly 15% of the workforce not covered
         by Title VII. See Eisenberg &amp;amp; Schwab, The Importance of Section 1981, 73 Cornell L.
         Rev. 596, 602 (1988). A § 1981 backpay award may also extend beyond the 2-year limit of
         Title VII. Johnson, 421 U. S., at 460. Moreover, a § 1981 plaintiff is not limited to
         recovering backpay: she may also obtain damages, including punitive damages in an
         appropriate case. Ibid. Other differences between the two statutes include the right to a
         jury trial under § 1981, but not Title VII; a different statute of limitations in <span
            class="star-pagination">*212</span> § 1981 cases, see Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 482
         U. S. 656 (1987); and the availability under Title VII, but not § 1981, of administrative
         machinery designed to provide assistance in investigation and conciliation, see Johnson,
         supra, at 460.<span class="sup">[15]</span> The fact that § 1981 provides a remedy for a
         type of racism that remains a serious social ill broader than that available under Title
         VII hardly provides a good reason to see it, as the Court seems to, as a disruptive blot on
         the legal landscape, a provision to be construed as narrowly as possible.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>C</h2>
      <p>Applying the standards set forth above, I believe the evidence in this case brings
         petitioner's harassment claim firmly within the scope of § 1981. Petitioner testified at
         trial that during her 10 years at McLean she was subjected to racial slurs; given more work
         than white employees and assigned the most demeaning tasks; passed over for promotion, not
         informed of promotion opportunities, and not offered training <span class="star-pagination"
            >*213</span> for higher level jobs; denied wage increases routinely given other
         employees; and singled out for scrutiny and criticism.</p>
      <p>Robert Stevenson, the general manager and later president of McLean, interviewed petitioner
         for a file clerk position in 1972. At that time he warned her that all those with whom she
         would be working were white women, and that they probably would not like working with a
         black. Tr. 1-19. In fact, however, petitioner testified that it was Stevenson and her
         supervisors who subjected her to racial harassment, rather than her co-workers. For
         example, petitioner testified that Stevenson told her on a number of occasions that "blacks
         are known to work slower than whites by nature," id., at 1-87 to 1-88, 2-80 to 2-81, or, as
         he put it in one instance, that "some animals [are] faster than other animals." Id., at
         2-83. Stevenson also repeatedly suggested that a white would be able to do petitioner's job
         better than she could. Id., at 1-83.<span class="sup">[16]</span>
      </p>
      <p>Despite petitioner's stated desire to "move up and advance" at McLean to an accounting or
         secretarial position, id., at 1-22, she testified that she was offered no training for a
         higher level job during her entire tenure at the credit union. Id., at 1-25. White
         employees were offered training, id., at 1-93, including a white employee at the same level
         as petitioner but with less seniority. That less senior white employee was eventually
         promoted to an intermediate accounting clerk position. Id., at 1-48 to 1-49, 2-114 to
         2-115. As with every other promotion opportunity that occurred, petitioner was never
         informed of the opening. Id., at 1-46, 1-91 to 1-92. During the 10 years petitioner worked
         for McLean, white persons were repeatedly hired for more senior <span
            class="star-pagination">*214</span> positions, without any notice of these job openings
         being posted, and without petitioner ever being informed of, let alone interviewed for, any
         of these opportunities. Id., at 1-93 to 1-97. Petitioner claimed to have received different
         treatment as to wage increases as well as promotion opportunities. Thus she testified that
         she had been denied a promised pay raise after her first six months at McLean, though white
         employees automatically received pay raises after six months. Id., at 1-84 to 1-85. See
         also id., at 1-60 to 1-65 (denial of merit increase).</p>
      <p>Petitioner testified at length about allegedly unequal work assignments given by Stevenson
         and her other supervisors, id., at 1-27 to 1-28, 1-30, and detailed the extent of her work
         assignments. Id., at 1-31, 1-101 to 1-120, 2-18, 2-119 to 2-121. When petitioner complained
         about her workload, she was given no help with it. Id., at 1-82 to 1-83. In fact, she was
         given more work and was told she always had the option of quitting. Id., at 1-29.
         Petitioner claimed that she was also given more demeaning tasks than white employees and
         was the only clerical worker who was required to dust and to sweep. Id., at 1-31. She was
         also the only clerical worker whose tasks were not reassigned during a vacation. Whenever
         white employees went on vacation, their work was reassigned; but petitioner's work was
         allowed to accumulate for her return. Id., at 1-37, 1-87.</p>
      <p>Petitioner further claimed that Stevenson scrutinized her more closely and criticized her
         more severely than white employees. Stevenson, she testified, would repeatedly stare at her
         while she was working, although he would not do this to white employees. Id., at 1-38 to
         1-39, 1-90 to 1-91. Stevenson also made a point of criticizing the work of white employees
         in private, or discussing their mistakes at staff meetings without attributing the error to
         a particular individual. But he would chastise petitioner and the only other black employee
         publicly at staff meetings. Id., at 1-40, 1-89 to 1-90, 2-72 to 2-73.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*215</span> The defense introduced evidence at trial
         contesting each of these assertions by petitioner. But given the extent and nature of the
         evidence produced by Patterson, and the importance of credibility determinations in
         assigning weight to that evidence, the jury may well have concluded that petitioner was
         subjected to such serious and extensive racial harassment as to have been denied the right
         to make an employment contract on the same basis as white employees of the credit
            union.<span class="sup">[17]</span>
      </p>
      <p/>
      <h2>III</h2>
      <p>I agree that the District Court erred when it instructed the jury as to petitioner's burden
         in proving her claim that McLean violated § 1981 by failing to promote her, because she is
         black, to an intermediate accounting clerk position. The District Court instructed the jury
         that Patterson had to prove not only that she was denied a promotion because of her race,
         but also that she was better qualified than the white employee who had allegedly received
         the promotion. That instruction is inconsistent with the scheme of proof we have carefully
         designed, in analogous cases, "to bring the litigants and the court expeditiously and
         fairly to [the] ultimate question" whether the defendant intentionally discriminated
         against the plaintiff. Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248, 253
         (1981).</p>
      <p>A § 1981 plaintiff must prove purposeful discrimination. General Building Contractors
         Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U. S., at 391. Where the ultimate issue in a
         disparate-treatment action is whether the defendant intentionally discriminated against the
         plaintiff, a well-established framework of proof applies if the plaintiff offers only
         indirect evidence of discriminatory motive. See McDonnell Douglas <span
            class="star-pagination">*216</span> Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792 (1973) (Title VII);
         Dister v. The Continental Group, Inc., 859 F. 2d 1108 (CA2 1988) (discriminatory
         interference with right to benefits, in violation of § 510 of the Employee Retirement
         Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U. S. C. § 1140); Loeb v. Textron, Inc., 600 F. 2d 1003
         (CA1 1979) (violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U. S. C. § 621 et
         seq.). There is no reason why this scheme of proof, carefully structured as a "sensible,
         orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of common experience as it bears on the
         critical question of discrimination," Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters, 438 U. S. 567,
         577 (1978), should not apply to claims of racial discrimination under § 1981. Indeed, the
         Court of Appeals held below that "[t]he disparate treatment proof scheme developed for
         Title VII actions in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, [supra,] and its progeny, may
         properly be transposed, as here, to the jury trial of a § 1981 claim." 805 F. 2d 1143, 1147
         (CA4 1986). The courts below erred, however, in identifying a § 1981 plaintiff's burden
         under that framework.</p>
      <p>A black plaintiff claiming that an employment decision infringed her § 1981 right to make
         and enforce contracts on the same terms as white persons has the initial burden of
         establishing a prima facie case. This burden is not an onerous one. Burdine, supra, at 253.
         The plaintiff need only prove by a preponderence of the evidence that she applied for an
         available position for which she was qualified, see supra, at 213-214, that she was
         rejected, and that the employer either continued to seek applicants for the position, or,
         as allegedly occurred in this case, filled the position with a white employee, see
         McDonnell Douglas, supra, at 802; Burdine, supra, at 253. We have required at this stage
         proof only that a plaintiff was qualified for the position she sought, not proof that she
         was better qualified than other applicants. See McDonnell Douglas, supra, at 802; Burdine,
         supra, at 253, n. 6. Proof sufficient to make out a prima facie case raises a presumption
         that the employer acted for impermissible <span class="star-pagination">*217</span>
         reasons, see Furnco Construction Corp., supra, at 577, which the employer may then rebut by
         articulating "some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's rejection,"
         McDonnell Douglas, supra, at 802.</p>
      <p>In this case, in addition to attacking petitioner's claim to have made out a prima facie
         case, respondent introduced evidence tending to show that if it promoted a white employee
         over petitioner, it did so because the white employee was better qualified for the job.
         This evidence rebutted any presumption of discrimination raised by petitioner's prima facie
         case. Our cases make it clear, however, that a plaintiff must have the opportunity to
         introduce evidence to show that the employer's proffered reasons for its decision were not
         its true reasons. It is equally well established that this evidence may take a variety of
         forms. McDonnell Douglas, supra, at 804-805; Furnco Construction Corp., supra, at 578.
         Though petitioner might have sought to prove that McLean's claim to have promoted a better
         qualified applicant was not its true reason by showing she was in fact better qualified
         than the person promoted, the District Court erred in instructing the jury that to succeed
         petitioner was required to make that showing. Such an instruction is much too restrictive,
         cutting off other methods of proving pretext plainly recognized in our cases. We suggested
         in McDonnell Douglas, for example, that a black plaintiff might be able to prove pretext by
         showing that the employer has promoted white employees who lack the qualifications the
         employer relies upon, or by proving the employer's "general policy and practice with
         respect to minority employment." 411 U. S., at 804-805. And, of particular relevance given
         petitioner's evidence of racial harassment and her allegation that respondent failed to
         train her for an accounting position because of her race, we suggested that evidence of the
         employer's past treatment of the plaintiff would be relevant to a showing that the
         employer's proffered legitimate reason was not its true reason. Id., at 804. There are
         innumerable different <span class="star-pagination">*218</span> ways in which a plaintiff
         seeking to prove intentional discrimination by means of indirect evidence may show that an
         employer's stated reason is pretextual and not its real reason. The plaintiff may not be
         forced to pursue any one of these in particular.<span class="sup">[18]</span>
      </p>
      <p>I therefore agree that petitioner's promotion discrimination claim must be remanded because
         of the District Court's erroneous instruction as to petitioner's burden. It seems to me,
         however, that the Court of Appeals was correct when it said that promotion-discrimination
         claims are cognizable under § 1981 because they "go to the very existence and nature of the
         employment contract." 805 F. 2d, at 1145. The Court's disagreement with this commonsense
         view, and its statement that "the question whether a promotion claim is actionable under §
         1981 depends upon whether the nature of the change in position was such that it involved
         the opportunity to enter into a new contract with the employer," ante, at 185, display
         nicely how it seeks to eliminate with technicalities the protection § 1981 was intended to
         afford &#x97; to limit protection to the form of the contract entered into, and not to
         extend it, as Congress intended, to the substance of the contract as it is worked out in
         practice. Under the Court's view, the employer may deny any number of promotions solely on
         the basis of race, safe from a § 1981 suit, provided it is careful that promotions do not
         involve new contracts. <span class="star-pagination">*219</span> It is admittedly difficult
         to see how a "promotion" &#x97; which would seem to imply different duties and employment
         terms &#x97; could be achieved without a new contract, and it may well be as a result that
         promotion claims will always be cognizable under § 1981. Nevertheless, the same criticisms
         I have made of the Court's decision regarding harassment claims apply here: proof that an
         employee was not promoted because she is black &#x97; while all around white peers are
         advanced &#x97; shows that the black employee has in substance been denied the opportunity
         to contract on the equal terms that § 1981 guarantees.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>IV</h2>
      <p>In summary, I would hold that the Court of Appeals erred in deciding that petitioner's
         racial harassment claim is not cognizable under § 1981. It likewise erred in holding that
         petitioner could succeed in her promotion-discrimination claim only by proving that she was
         better qualified for the position of intermediate accounting clerk than the white employee
         who was in fact promoted.</p>
      <p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</p>
      <p>When I first confronted the task of interpreting § 1981, I was persuaded by Justice
         Cardozo's admonition that it is wise for the judge to " `lay one's own course of bricks on
         the secure foundation of the courses laid by others who had gone before him.' " Runyon v.
         McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 191 (1976) (concurring opinion) (quoting B. Cardozo, The Nature of
         the Judicial Process 149 (1921)). The Court had already construed the statutory reference
         to the right "to make and enforce contracts" as a guarantee of equal opportunity, and not
         merely a guarantee of equal rights. Today the Court declines its own invitation to tear
         down that foundation and begin to build a different legal structure on its original text. I
         agree, of course, that Runyon should not be overruled. I am also persuaded, however, that
         the meaning that had already been <span class="star-pagination">*220</span> given to "the
         same right . . . to make and enforce contracts" that "is enjoyed by white citizens" &#x97;
         the statutory foundation that was preserved in Runyon &#x97; encompasses an employee's
         right to protection from racial harassment by her employer.</p>
      <p>In Runyon we held that § 1981 prohibits a private school from excluding qualified children
         because they are not white citizens. Just as a qualified nonwhite child has a statutory
         right to equal access to a private school, so does a nonwhite applicant for employment have
         a statutory right to enter into a personal service contract with a private employer on the
         same terms as a white citizen. If an employer should place special obstacles in the path of
         a black job applicant &#x97; perhaps by requiring her to confront an openly biased and
         hostile interviewer &#x97; the interference with the statutory right to make contracts to
         the same extent "as is enjoyed by white citizens" would be plain.</p>
      <p>Similarly, if the white and the black applicants are offered the same terms of employment
         with just one exception &#x97; that the black employee would be required to work in dark,
         uncomfortable surroundings, whereas the white employee would be given a well-furnished,
         two-window office &#x97; the discrimination would be covered by the statute. In such a
         case, the Court would find discrimination in the making of the contract because the
         disparity surfaced before the contract was made. See ante, at 176-177, 179, 180, 184. Under
         the Court's understanding of the statute, the black applicant might recover on one of two
         theories: She might demonstrate that the employer intended to discourage her from taking
         the job &#x97; which is the equivalent of a "refusal to enter into a contract" &#x97; or
         she might show that the employer actually intended to enter a contract, but "only on
         discriminatory terms." Ante, at 177. Under the second of these theories of recovery,
         however, it is difficult to discern why an employer who makes his intentions known has
         discriminated in the "making" of a contract, while the employer who conceals his
         discriminatory intent until after the applicant has accepted <span class="star-pagination"
            >*221</span> the job, only later to reveal that black employees are intentionally
         harassed and insulted, has not.</p>
      <p>It is also difficult to discern why an employer who does not decide to treat black
         employees less favorably than white employees until after the contract of employment is
         first conceived is any less guilty of discriminating in the "making" of a contract. A
         contract is not just a piece of paper. Just as a single word is the skin of a living
         thought, so is a contract evidence of a vital, ongoing relationship between human beings.
         An at-will employee, such as petitioner, is not merely performing an existing contract; she
         is constantly remaking that contract. Whenever significant new duties are assigned to the
         employee &#x97; whether they better or worsen the relationship &#x97; the contract is
         amended and a new contract is made. Thus, if after the employment relationship is formed,
         the employer deliberately implements a policy of harassment of black employees, it has
         imposed a contractual term on them that is not the "same" as the contractual provisions
         that are "enjoyed by white citizens." Moreover, whether employed at will or for a fixed
         term, employees typically strive to achieve a more rewarding relationship with their
         employers. By requiring black employees to work in a hostile environment, the employer has
         denied them the same opportunity for advancement that is available to white citizens. A
         deliberate policy of harassment of black employees who are competing with white citizens
         is, I submit, manifest discrimination in the making of contracts in the sense in which that
         concept was interpreted in Runyon v. McCrary, supra. I cannot believe that the decision in
         that case would have been different if the school had agreed to allow the black students to
         attend, but subjected them to segregated classes and other racial abuse.</p>
      <p>Indeed, in Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 482 U. S. 656 (1987), we built further on the
         foundation laid in Runyon. We decided that a union's "toleration and tacit encouragement of
         racial harassment" violates § 1981. 482 U. S., at <span class="star-pagination">*222</span>
         665. Although the Court now explains that the Lukens decision rested on the union's
         interference with its members' right to enforce their collective-bargaining agreement, see
         ante, at 177-178, 183, when I joined that opinion I thought &#x97; and I still think &#x97;
         that the holding rested comfortably on the foundation identified in Runyon. In fact, in the
         section of the Lukens opinion discussing the substantive claim, the Court did not once use
         the term "enforce" or otherwise refer to that particular language in the statute. 482 U.
         S., at 664-669.</p>
      <p>The Court's repeated emphasis on the literal language of § 1981 might be appropriate if it
         were building a new foundation, but it is not a satisfactory method of adding to the
         existing structure. In the name of logic and coherence, the Court today adds a course of
         bricks dramatically askew from "the secure foundation of the courses laid by others,"
         replacing a sense of rational direction and purpose in the law with an aimless confinement
         to a narrow construction of what it means to "make" a contract.</p>
      <p>For the foregoing reasons, and for those stated in Parts II-B and II-C of JUSTICE BRENNAN's
         opinion, I respectfully dissent from the conclusion reached in Part III of the Court's
         opinion. I also agree with JUSTICE BRENNAN's discussion of the promotion claim.</p>
      </div><div type="notes">
      <p>[*] Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the United States by Solicitor
         General Fried, Assistant Attorney General Reynolds, Deputy Solicitor General Ayer, Deputy
         Assistant Attorney General Clegg, Glen D. Nager, and Jessica Dunsay Silver; and for the
         American Civil Liberties Union Foundation et al. by Steven R. Shapiro, John A. Powell,
         Helen Hershkoff, and Adam Stein.</p>
      <p>[1] JUSTICE BRENNAN chides us for ignoring what he considers "two very obvious reasons" for
         adhering to Runyon. Post, at 191. First, he argues at length that Runyon was correct as an
         initial matter. See post, at 191-199. As we have said, however, see supra, at 171-172, it
         is unnecessary for us to address this issue because we agree that, whether or not Runyon
         was correct as an initial matter, there is no special justification for departing here from
         the rule of stare decisis. </p>
      <p>JUSTICE BRENNAN objects also to the fact that our stare decisis analysis places no reliance
         on the fact that Congress itself has not overturned the interpretation of § 1981 contained
         in Runyon, and in effect has ratified our decision in that case. See post, at 200-205. This
         is no oversight on our part. As we reaffirm today, considerations of stare decisis have
         added force in statutory cases because Congress may alter what we have done by amending the
         statute. In constitutional cases, by contrast, Congress lacks this option, and an incorrect
         or outdated precedent may be overturned only by our own reconsideration or by
         constitutional amendment. See supra, at 172-173. It does not follow, however, that
         Congress' failure to overturn a statutory precedent is reason for this Court to adhere to
         it. It is "impossible to assert with any degree of assurance that congressional failure to
         act represents" affirmative congressional approval of the Court's statutory interpretation.
         Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County, 480 U. S. 616, 671-672 (1987)
         (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Congress may legislate, moreover, only through the passage of a
         bill which is approved by both Houses and signed by the President. See U. S. Const., Art.
         I, § 7, cl. 2. Congressional inaction cannot amend a duly enacted statute. We think also
         that the materials relied upon by JUSTICE BRENNAN as "more positive signs of Congress'
         views," which are the failure of an amendment to a different statute offered before our
         decision in Runyon, see post, at 201-204, and the passage of an attorney's fee statute
         having nothing to do with our holding in Runyon, see post, at 204-205, demonstrate well the
         danger of placing undue reliance on the concept of congressional "ratification."</p>
      <p>[2] In addition, another of respondent's managers testified that when he recommended a
         different black person for a position as a data processor, petitioner's supervisor stated
         that he did not "need any more problems around here," and that he would "search for
         additional people who are not black." Tr. 2-160 to 2-161.</p>
      <p>[3] See, e. g., Firefighters Institute for Racial Equality v. St. Louis, 549 F. 2d 506,
         514-515 (CA8), cert. denied sub nom. Banta v. United States, 434 U. S. 819 (1977); Rogers
         v. EEOC, 454 F. 2d 234 (CA5 1971), cert. denied, 406 U. S. 957 (1972).</p>
      <p>[4] Unnecessary overlap between Title VII and § 1981 would also serve to upset the delicate
         balance between employee and employer rights struck by Title VII in other respects. For
         instance, a plaintiff in a Title VII action is limited to a recovery of backpay, whereas
         under § 1981 a plaintiff may be entitled to plenary compensatory damages, as well as
         punitive damages in an appropriate case. Both the employee and employer will be unlikely to
         agree to a conciliatory resolution of the dispute under Title VII if the employer can be
         found liable for much greater amounts under § 1981.</p>
      <p>[5] This was the permissible use of evidence of racial harassment that the Fourth Circuit,
         in its decision below, envisioned for § 1981 cases. See 805 F. 2d 1143, 1145 (1986).</p>
      <p>[6] In his separate opinion, JUSTICE STEVENS construes the phrase "the same right . . . to
         make . . . contracts" with ingenuity to cover various postformation conduct by the
         employer. But our task here is not to construe § 1981 to punish all acts of discrimination
         in contracting in a like fashion, but rather merely to give a fair reading to scope of the
         statutory terms used by Congress. We adhere today to our decision in Runyon that § 1981
         reaches private conduct, but do not believe that holding compels us to read the statutory
         terms "make" and "enforce" beyond their plain and commonsense meaning. We believe that the
         lower courts will have little difficulty applying the straightforward principles that we
         announce today.</p>
      <p>[7] Here, respondent argues that petitioner cannot make out a prima facie case on her
         promotion claim because she did not prove either that respondent was seeking applicants for
         the intermediate accounting clerk position or that the white employee named to fill that
         position in fact received a "promotion" from her prior job. Although we express no opinion
         on the merits of these claims, we do emphasize that in order to prove that she was denied
         the same right to make and enforce contracts as white citizens, petitioner must show, inter
         alia, that she was in fact denied an available position.</p>

         penalties, and to none other, any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, to the
         contrary notwithstanding."</p>
      <p>All members of the Court agreed in Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U. S. 409 (1968), that
         intervening revisions in the property clause of § 1 &#x97; the reenactment of the 1866 Act
         in § 18 of the Voting Rights Act of 1870, ch. 114, § 18, 16 Stat. 144, the codification of
         the property clause in § 1978 of the Revised Statutes of 1874, and its recodification as 42
         U. S. C. § 1982 &#x97; had not altered its substance. Jones, 392 U. S., at 436-437 (opinion
         of the Court); id., at 453 (dissenting opinion).</p>
      <p>[2] In support of its view, the Court in Jones quoted from an exchange during the House
         debate on the civil rights bill. When Congressman Loan of Missouri asked the Chairman of
         the House Judiciary Committee why § 2 had been limited to those who acted under color of
         law, he was told, not that the statute had no application at all to those who had not acted
         under color of law, but that the limitation had been imposed because it was not desired to
         make " `a general criminal code for the States.' " Id., at 425, n. 33, quoting Cong. Globe,
         39th Cong., 1st Sess., 1120 (1866). Justice Harlan in dissent conceded that the Court's
         interpretation of this exchange as supporting a broader reading of § 1 was "a conceivable
         one." 392 U. S., at 470.</p>
      <p>[3] See, e. g., Brief for Petitioners 12-16, Brief for Respondents 7-24, Brief for United

         Discrimination in Housing et al. as Amici Curiae 9-39, in Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., O.
         T. 1967, No. 45.</p>
      <p>[4] Report of C. Schurz, S. Exec. Doc. No. 2, 39th Cong., 1st Sess. (1865). The Schurz
         report is replete with descriptions of private discrimination, relating both to the
         freedmen's ability to enter into contracts and to their treatment once under contract. It
         notes, for example, that some planters had initially endeavored to maintain "the relation
         of master and slave, partly by concealing from [their slaves] the great changes that had
         taken place, and partly by terrorizing them into submission to their behests." Id., at 15.
         It portrays as commonplace the use of "force and intimidation" to keep former slaves on the
         plantations: </p>
      <p>"In many instances negroes who walked away from the plantations, or were found upon the
         roads, were shot or otherwise severely punished, which was calculated to produce the
         impression among those remaining with their masters that an attempt to escape from slavery
         would result in certain destruction." Id., at 17.</p>
      <p>In Georgia, Schurz reported, "the reckless and restless characters of that region had
         combined to keep the negroes where they belonged," shooting those caught trying to escape.
         Id., at 18. The effect of this private violence against those who tried to leave their
         former masters was that "large numbers [of freedmen], terrified by what they saw and heard,
         quietly remained under the restraint imposed upon them." Ibid. See Jones, 392 U. S., at
         428-429.</p>
      <p>It must therefore have been evident to members of the 39th Congress that, quite apart from
         the Black Codes, the freedmen would not enjoy the same right as whites to contract or to
         own or lease property so long as private discrimination remained rampant. This broad view
         of the obstacles to the freedmen's enjoyment of contract and property rights was similarly
         expressed in the Howard Report on the operation of the Freedmen's Bureau, H. R. Exec. Doc.
         No. 11, 39th Cong., 1st Sess. (1865). It likewise appears in the hearings conducted by the
         Joint Committee on Reconstruction contemporaneously with Congress' consideration of the
         civil rights bill. See Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, 39th Cong., 1st
         Sess., pts. I-IV (1866). These investigations uncovered numerous incidents of violence
         aimed at restraining southern blacks' efforts to exercise their new-won freedom, e. g.,
         id., pt. III, p. 143, and whippings aimed simply at making them work harder, or handed out
         as punishment for a laborer's transgressions, e. g., id., pt. IV, p. 83, as well, for
         example, as refusals to pay freedmen more than a fraction of white laborers' wages, e. g.,
         id., pt. II, pp. 12-13, 54-55, 234.</p>
      <p>[5] Senator Trumbull was speaking here of his Freedmen's Bureau bill, which was regarded as
         having the same scope as his later civil rights bill. See supra, at 193-194. </p>
      <p>For other statements indicating that § 1 reached private conduct, see Cong. Globe, 39th
         Cong., 1st Sess., 1118 (1866) ("Laws barbaric and treatment inhuman are the rewards meted
         out by our white enemies to our colored friends. We should put a stop to this at once and
         forever") (Rep. Wilson); id., at 1152 (bill aimed at "the tyrannical acts, the tyrannical
         restrictions, and the tyrannical laws which belong to the condition of slavery") (emphasis
         added) (Rep. Thayer).</p>

      <p>[7] Congress originally entrusted the revision of the laws to three Commissioners appointed
         under the Act of June 27, 1866, 14 Stat. 74-75. These Commissioners were instructed to
         draft sidenotes indicating the source of each section of their revision, § 2, id., at 75,
         and they wrote the marginal note to what became § 1977 of the Revised Statutes, which
         referred as a source only to § 16 of the 1870 Act. See 1 Revision of the United States
         Statutes as Drafted by the Commissioners Appointed for that Purpose 947 (1872). Congress
         rejected the work of the Commissioners, however, precisely because Members believed it to
         contain new legislation. See 2 Cong. Rec. 646 (1874). Congress then appointed Thomas Durant
         to review the Commissioners' work. See Act of Mar. 3, 1873, § 3, 17 Stat. 580. "[W]herever
         the meaning of the law had been changed," Durant was "to strike out such changes." 2 Cong.
         Rec. 646 (1874). Durant reported that he had compared the Commissioners' revision with
         preexisting statutes, and that "wherever it has been found that a section contained any
         departure from the meaning of Congress as expressed in the Statutes at Large, such change
         has been made as was necessary to restore the original signification." Report to the Joint
         Committee on the Revision of the Laws 1 (1873). Durant's revision, H. R. 1215, 43d Cong.,
         1st Sess. (1874), which was put before Congress in the form of a bill, see 2 Cong. Rec. 819
         (1874), contained no marginal notations. See id., at 826-827, 1210. The Commissioners'
         reference to § 16 reappeared only after Congress authorized the Secretary of State to
         publish the Revised Statutes with marginal notations. See Act of June 20, 1874, ch. 333, §
         2, 18 Stat. (part 3) 113. Apparently, the Secretary simply lifted notations from the
         Commissioners' draft revision. Hence, insofar as Durant might have thought that the
         Commissioners had changed the law by referring only to § 16 as their source, and that this
         problem had been cured merely by the omission of the marginal note from his own draft, it
         seems strained to rely upon the later decision to restore the Commissioners' marginal notes
         as evidence that § 1977 derives solely from § 16. This is particularly so in light of
         criticism directed in Congress to the accuracy of some of the Commissioners' side-notes.
         See 2 Cong. Rec. 828 (1874) (citing as an error a marginal note that was "not sufficiently
         comprehensive" to reflect the provision's source) (Rep. Lawrence).</p>
      <p>[8] I find strong support for our prior holding that § 1981 is derived in part from the
         1866 Act in the legislative history of the 1874 codification. Representative Lawrence, a
         member of the Joint Committee on the Revision of the Laws, specifically commented in the
         House upon the proposed revision of the 1866 and 1870 Acts. Id., at 827-828. He noted that
         the plan of revision was "to collate in one title of `civil rights' the statutes which
         declare them." Id., at 827. After setting out § 1 and § 2 of the 1866 Act, and then § 16
         and § 17 of the 1870 Act, Representative Lawrence stated that the revisers had "very
         properly not treated [the 1870 Act] as superseding the entire original act." Id., at 828.
         Rather, they had "translat[ed] the sections I have cited from the acts of 1866 and 1870, so
         far as they relate to a declaration of existing rights," in the provisions that have now
         become § 1981 and § 1982. Ibid. There is no hint in this passage that any part of the 1866
         Act would be lost in the revision, and indeed in other parts of his statement
         Representative Lawrence makes it plain that he understood the revisers' task to be that of
         presenting "the actual state of the law." Id., at 826. See also id., at 647-649 (general
         discussion on the aim of the revision to codify existing law without modification), and
         id., at 1210 ("[W]e do not purpose to alter the law one jot or title") (Rep. Poland).</p>

      <p>[10] The Court had remarked in Jones upon the close parallel between § 1981 and § 1982. 392
         U. S., at 441, n. 78. Moreover, the lower federal courts already had begun to interpret §
         1981 to reach private employment discrimination. See, e. g., Waters v. Wisconsin Steel
         Works, 427 F. 2d 476 (CA7), cert. denied, 400 U. S. 911 (1970); Sanders v. Dobbs Houses,

      <p>[11] See also 118 Cong. Rec. 3370 (1972) (Sen. Javits) (opposing the Hruska amendment
         because it would "cut off . . . the possibility of using civil rights acts long antedating
         the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in a given situation which might fall, because of the statute
         of limitations or other provisions, in the interstices of the Civil Rights Act of
         1964").</p>
      <p>[12] The Court's overly narrow reading of the language of § 1981 is difficult to square
         with our interpretation of the equal right protected by § 1982 "to inherit, purchase,
         lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property" not just as covering the rights
         to acquire and dispose of property, but also the "right . . . to use property on an equal
         basis with white citizens," Memphis v. Greene, 451 U. S. 100, 120 (1981) (emphasis added),
         and "not to have property interests impaired because of . . . race," id., at 122 (emphasis
         added). </p>
      <p>In Shaare Tefila Congregation v. Cobb, 481 U. S. 615 (1987), we reversed the dismissal of a
         claim by a Jewish congregation alleging that individuals were liable under § 1982 for
         spraying racist graffiti on the walls of the congregation's synagogue. Though our holding
         in that case was limited to deciding that Jews are a group protected by § 1982, our opinion
         nowhere hints that the congregation's vandalism claim might not be cognizable under the
         statute because it implicated the use of property, and not its acquisition or disposal.</p>
      <p>[13] I observe too that a company's imposition of discriminatory working conditions on
         black employees will tend to deter other black persons from seeking employment. "[W]hen a
         person is deterred, because of his race, from even entering negotiations, his equal
         opportunity to contract is denied as effectively as if he were discouraged by an offer of
         less favorable terms." Comment, Developments in the Law &#x97; Section 1981, 15 Harv. Civ.
         Rights-Civ. Lib. L. Rev. 29, 101 (1980).</p>
      <p>[14] In Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57 (1986), we addressed the question
         whether allegations of discriminatory workplace harassment state a claim under § 703 of
         Title VII, 42 U. S. C. § 2000e-2(a)(1), which prohibits discrimination "with respect to [an
         employee's] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." We held that
         sexual harassment creating a hostile workplace environment may ground an action under Title
         VII. "[N]ot all workplace conduct that may be described as `harassment' affects a `term,
         condition, or privilege' of employment within the meaning of Title VII," however. 477 U.
         S., at 67. "For sexual harassment to be actionable it must be sufficiently severe or
         pervasive `to alter the conditions of [the victim's] employment and create an abusive
         working environment.' " Ibid. Similarly, not all workplace conduct that may be described as
         racial harassment affects an employee's right to make contracts free of discrimination. But
         racial harassment of sufficient severity may impinge upon that right, as explained in the
         text, and should be actionable under § 1981. </p>
      <p>Petitioner has never argued that the harassment she allegedly suffered amounted to a breach
         of an express or implied contract under state law, so this case presents no occasion to
         consider the United States' view that such a breach is actionable under § 1981 because it
         deprives a black employee of the same right to make contracts as a white person.</p>
      <p>[15] The Court suggests that overlap between § 1981 and Title VII interferes with Title
         VII's mediation and conciliation procedures. Ante, at 180-182, and n. 4. In Johnson v.
         Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U. S., at 461, however, we rejected a suggestion that the
         need for Title VII procedures to continue unimpeded by collateral litigation required that
         the timely filing of a discrimination charge with the EEOC toll the limitation period for §
         1981: </p>
      <p>"Conciliation and persuasion through the administrative process . . . often constitute a
         desirable approach to settlement of disputes based on sensitive and emotional charges of
         invidious employment discrimination. We recognize, too, that the filing of a lawsuit might
         tend to deter efforts at conciliation, that a lack of success in the legal action could
         weaken the [EEOC's] efforts to induce voluntary compliance, and that suit is privately
         oriented and narrow, rather than broad, in application, as successful conciliation tends to
         be. But these are the natural effects of the choice Congress has made available to the
         claimant by its conferring upon him independent administrative and judicial remedies. The
         choice is a valuable one. Under some circumstances, the administrative route may be highly
         preferred over the litigatory; under others, the reverse may be true." (Emphasis
         added.)</p>
      <p>[16] A former manager of data processing for McLean testified that when he recommended a
         black person for a position as a data processor, Stevenson criticized him, saying that he
         did not "need any more problems around here," that he would interview the person, but not
         hire him, and that he would then "search for additional people who are not black." Tr.
         2-160 to 2-161.</p>
      <p>[17] The proposed jury instruction quoted by the Court, ante, at 179, is scarcely
         conclusive as to the nature of Patterson's harassment claim. Indeed, it is precisely
         harassment so pervasive as to create a discriminatory work environment that will
         demonstrate that a black plaintiff has been denied an opportunity to contract on equal
         terms with white employees.</p>
      <p>[18] The Court of Appeals mistakenly held that the instruction requiring petitioner to
         prove her superior qualifications was necessary in order to protect the employer's right to
         choose among equally well-qualified applicants. As we stated in Texas Dept. of Community
         Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248, 259 (1981): "[T]he employer has discretion to choose
         among equally qualified candidates, provided the decision is not based upon unlawful
         criteria." (Emphasis added.) Where a plaintiff proves that an employer's purported reasons
         for a promotion decision were all pretextual, the factfinder may infer that the employer's
         decision was not based upon lawful criteria; and, as I point out in the text, there are
         many ways in which a plaintiff can prove pretext other than by proving her superior
         qualifications.</p>
