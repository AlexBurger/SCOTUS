      </span> (1986) DELAWARE v. VAN ARSDALL No. 84-1279. <p>Supreme Court of United States.</p>
      Argued January 22, 1986 Decided April 7, 1986 CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF DELAWARE
         <p>Richard E. Fairbanks, Jr., argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were
         Charles M. Oberly III, Attorney General of Delaware, and Gary A. Myers and Loren C. Meyers,
         Deputy Attorneys General.</p>
      <p>Paul J. Larkin, Jr., argued the cause for the United States as amicus curiae urging
         reversal. With him on the brief <span class="star-pagination">*674</span> were Acting
         Solicitor General Fried, Assistant Attorney General Trott, Deputy Solicitor General Frey,
         and Vincent L. Gambale.</p>
      <p>John Williams argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was William N.
         Nicholas.</p>
      <p>JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
      <p>Respondent Robert Van Arsdall was convicted of murder in a Delaware trial court. The
         Supreme Court of Delaware reversed his conviction on the ground that the trial court, by
         improperly restricting defense counsel's cross-examination designed to show bias on the
         part of a prosecution witness, had violated respondent's confrontation rights under the
         Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and that such violation
         required automatic reversal. 486 A. 2d 1 (1984). While we agree that the trial court's
         ruling was contrary to the mandate of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, we
         conclude that the Supreme Court of Delaware was wrong when it declined to consider whether
         that ruling was harmless in the context of the trial as a whole.</p>
      <p>Shortly after midnight on January 1, 1982, Doris Epps was stabbed to death in an apartment
         in Smyrna, Delaware, after an all-day New Year's Eve party. Respondent and Daniel Pregent,
         who by respondent's testimony were the only two people in the apartment with Epps at the
         time she was killed, were arrested at the scene of the crime and charged with Epps' murder.
         At separate trials, respondent was convicted and Pregent was acquitted.</p>
      <p>The State's case against respondent was based on circumstantial evidence, and proceeded on
         the theory that respondent had either killed Epps or assisted Pregent in doing so. Several
         of the partygoers testified about the party and the scene after the killing. The party,
         which lasted from late in the morning of December 31, 1981, until shortly before midnight,
         was held in the adjacent apartments of Pregent and <span class="star-pagination"
            >*675</span> Robert Fleetwood. Respondent, who was one of at least a dozen guests who
         attended the party during the course of the day, had stopped in for two brief periods in
         the late afternoon and early evening and then returned for a third time at about 11:30 p.m.
         By that time the party was over. Pregent had quarreled with a female guest, kicked a hole
         in a hallway wall and had to be restrained. An intoxicated Epps had been placed on a sofa
         bed in Pregent's apartment after passing out. And shortly before 11 p.m., a second
         altercation of some kind occurred, prompting Fleetwood to close the party in his apartment
         to everyone except his two friends, Alice Meinier and Mark Mood. When respondent returned
         to Pregent's apartment at about 11:30, only Pregent and Epps were present.</p>
      <p>Robert Fleetwood was the 10th of 16 prosecution witnesses. In addition to recounting
         uncontroverted facts about the party, he testified that sometime between 11 and 11:30 p.m.
         he walked across the hall, looked into Pregent's living room from the doorway, and saw
         respondent sitting on the edge of the sofa bed next to Pregent's feet. Fleetwood, who did
         not have a complete view of the bed, did not see Epps or anyone else in the apartment. Upon
         returning to his own apartment, Fleetwood stayed awake long enough to hear nearby bells
         ring in the New Year, at which point he passed out. App. 82-85.</p>
      <p>Meinier, who with Mood had remained awake in Fleetwood's apartment, testified that at
         roughly 1 a.m. respondent knocked at Fleetwood's door. Respondent's shirt and hands were
         spattered with blood, and he was holding a long, blood-covered knife. According to Meinier,
         respondent stated that "he had gotten in a fight" but that he "got them back." Id., at 130.
         After turning the knife over to Mood and washing his hands, respondent said "I think
         there's something wrong across the hall." Id., at 132. Meinier went to Pregent's apartment
         and discovered Epps' body lying in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor. Mood then summoned
         the police, who found respondent in Fleetwood's <span class="star-pagination">*676</span>
         apartment and Pregent asleep on the blood-splattered sofa bed in his living room.</p>
      <p>In addition to the testimony of the partygoers and the arresting officers, the State
         introduced Pregent's postarrest statement, respondent's two postarrest statements, and the
         testimony of a forensic expert. Among other things, the expert testified about the nature
         and source of the bloodstains on respondent's clothing.</p>
      <p>During Fleetwood's cross-examination, defense counsel sought to impeach Fleetwood by
         questioning him about the dismissal of a criminal charge against him &#x97; being drunk on
         a highway &#x97; after he had agreed to speak with the prosecutor about Epps' murder. When
         the prosecutor objected, the trial court allowed counsel to question Fleetwood on the
         matter outside the presence of the jury. Fleetwood acknowledged that the drunkenness charge
         had been dropped in exchange for his promise to speak with the prosecutor about the murder,
         but he denied that the agreement had affected his testimony.<span class="sup">[1]</span>
         The trial court barred any cross-examination about that agreement, citing Delaware Rule of
         Evidence 403.<span class="sup">[2]</span> The court also refused to permit defense counsel
         to cross-examine Fleetwood about his being questioned by the police in connection with an
         unrelated homicide that had occurred after Epps' murder. On voir dire conducted outside the
         presence of the jury, Fleetwood denied that he had been <span class="star-pagination"
            >*677</span> offered any favors, inducements, promises, or deals concerning that
         homicide investigation in exchange for his testimony at respondent's trial.</p>
      <p>Respondent was the only defense witness. Consistent with his second statement to the
         police, he attributed Epps' murder to Pregent. Consistent with Fleetwood's testimony, he
         stated that he had returned to Pregent's apartment, after drinking with friends, by about
         11:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Defense counsel admitted in their opening and closing arguments to the jury that respondent
         was in Pregent's apartment when Epps was killed. In closing argument, after attempting to
         discredit Fleetwood's testimony (largely by emphasizing his intoxication), counsel stressed
         that all that testimony proved was what respondent "never denied," that "he was at Danny
         Pregent's apartment before Doris Epps was murdered." App. 188-189. The jury found
         respondent guilty of first-degree murder and possession of a deadly weapon during the
         commission of a felony.</p>
      <p>On appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court reversed respondent's conviction on the authority of
         the Confrontation Clause. Noting that "the bias of a witness is subject to exploration at
         trial and is `always relevant as discrediting the witness and affecting the weight of his
         testimony,'" 486 A. 2d, at 6 (quoting Davis v. Alaska, 415 U. S. 308, 316 (1974)), the
         court found that the trial judge's ruling denied respondent his constitutional right to
         effective cross-examination. By barring any cross-examination of Fleetwood about the
         dismissal of the public drunkenness charge, the ruling kept from the jury facts concerning
         bias that were central to assessing Fleetwood's reliability. The court rejected the State's
         argument that since "Fleetwood's basic testimony was cumulative in nature and unimportant,"
         the Confrontation Clause error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 486 A. 2d, at 7. The
         court held that "a blanket prohibition against exploring potential bias through
         cross-examination" <span class="star-pagination">*678</span> is "a per se error," so that
         "the actual prejudicial impact of such an error is not examined." Ibid.<span class="sup"
            >[3]</span>
      </p>
      <p>We granted certiorari, 473 U. S. 923 (1985), and now vacate and remand.</p>
      <p>The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right of an accused in a
         criminal prosecution "to be confronted with the witnesses against him." The right of
         confrontation, which is secured for defendants in state as well as federal criminal
         proceedings, Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400 (1965), "means more than being allowed to
         confront the witness physically." Davis v. Alaska, 415 U. S., at 315. Indeed, " `[t]he main
         and essential purpose of confrontation is to secure for the opponent the opportunity of
         cross-examination.'" Id., at 315-316 (quoting 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 1395, p. 123 (3d ed.
         1940)) (emphasis in original). Of particular relevance here, "[w]e have recognized that the
         exposure of a witness' motivation in testifying is <span class="star-pagination"
            >*679</span> a proper and important function of the constitutionally protected right of
         cross-examination." Davis, supra, at 316-317 (citing Greene v. McElroy, 360 U. S. 474, 496
         (1959)). It does not follow, of course, that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth
         Amendment prevents a trial judge from imposing any limits on defense counsel's inquiry into
         the potential bias of a prosecution witness. On the contrary, trial judges retain wide
         latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on
         such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice,
         confusion of the issues, the witness' safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only
         marginally relevant. And as we observed earlier this Term, "the Confrontation Clause
         guarantees an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is
         effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish." Delaware v.
         Fensterer, 474 U. S. 15, 20 (1985) (per curiam) (emphasis in original).</p>
      <p>In this case, however, the trial court prohibited all inquiry into the possibility that
         Fleetwood would be biased as a result of the State's dismissal of his pending public
         drunkenness charge. By thus cutting off all questioning about an event that the State
         conceded had taken place and that a jury might reasonably have found furnished the witness
         a motive for favoring the prosecution in his testimony, the court's ruling violated
         respondent's rights secured by the Confrontation Clause.<span class="sup">[4]</span>
      </p>
      <p>The State somewhat tentatively suggests that a defendant should have to show "outcome
         determinative" prejudice in order to state a violation of the Confrontation Clause: Unless
         the particular limitation on cross-examination created a reasonable possibility that the
         jury returned an inaccurate guilty <span class="star-pagination">*680</span> verdict, that
         limitation would not violate the Confrontation Clause. We disagree. While some
         constitutional claims by their nature require a showing of prejudice with respect to the
         trial as a whole, see, e.g., Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984) (ineffective
         assistance of counsel), the focus of the Confrontation Clause is on individual witnesses.
         Accordingly, the focus of the prejudice inquiry in determining whether the confrontation
         right has been violated must be on the particular witness, not on the outcome of the entire
         trial. It would be a contradiction in terms to conclude that a defendant denied any
         opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses against him nonetheless had been afforded his
         right to "confront[ation]" because use of that right would not have affected the jury's
         verdict. We think that a criminal defendant states a violation of the Confrontation Clause
         by showing that he was prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination
         designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness, and thereby "to
         expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could appropriately draw inferences
         relating to the reliability of the witness." Davis v. Alaska, supra, at 318. Respondent has
         met that burden here: A reasonable jury might have received a significantly different
         impression of Fleetwood's credibility had respondent's counsel been permitted to pursue his
         proposed line of cross-examination.</p>
      <p>After concluding that the trial judge's ruling was constitutional error, the Delaware
         Supreme Court rebuffed the State's effort to show "beyond a reasonable doubt that the error
         complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained," Chapman v. California, 386 U. S.
         18, 24 (1967). In so doing, it offered no explanation why the Chapman harmless-error
         standard, which we have applied in other Confrontation Clause cases, e. g., Harrington v.
         California, 395 U. S. 250 (1969); Schneble v. Florida, 405 U. S. 427 (1972), is
         inapplicable here. We find respondent's efforts to defend the automatic reversal rule
         unconvincing.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*681</span> As we have stressed on more than one occasion,
         the Constitution entitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial, not a perfect one. E. g.,
         United States v. Hasting, 461 U. S. 499, 508-509 (1983); Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S.
         123, 135 (1968). In Chapman, this Court rejected the argument that all federal
         constitutional errors, regardless of their nature or the circumstances of the case, require
         reversal of a judgment of conviction. The Court reasoned that in the context of a
         particular case, certain constitutional errors, no less than other errors, may have been
         "harmless" in terms of their effect on the factfinding process at trial. Since Chapman, we
         have repeatedly reaffirmed the principle that an otherwise valid conviction should not be
         set aside if the reviewing court may confidently say, on the whole record, that the
         constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. E. g., United States v.
         Hasting, supra (improper comment on defendant's silence at trial); Moore v. Illinois, 434
         U. S. 220, 232 (1977) (admission of identification obtained in violation of right to
         counsel); Harrington v. California, supra (admission of nontestifying codefendant's
         statement). The harmless-error doctrine recognizes the principle that the central purpose
         of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant's guilt or
         innocence, United States v. Nobles, 422 U. S. 225, 230 (1975), and promotes public respect
         for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on
         the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error. Cf. R. Traynor, The Riddle of
         Harmless Error 50 (1970) ("Reversal for error, regardless of its effect on the judgment,
         encourages litigants to abuse the judicial process and bestirs the public to ridicule
         it").</p>
      <p>At the same time, we have observed that some constitutional errors &#x97; such as denying a
         defendant the assistance of counsel at trial, or compelling him to stand trial before a
         trier of fact with a financial stake in the outcome &#x97; are so fundamental and pervasive
         that they require reversal without regard to the facts or circumstances of the particular
         case. <span class="star-pagination">*682</span> Chapman, supra, at 23, n. 8 (citing, inter
         alia, Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963), and Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510 (1927)).
         The error at issue here is obviously quite different, however, as this Court's post-Chapman
         decisions demonstrate. In Harrington v. California, for example, we expressly rejected the
         claim that the admission into evidence of a statement made by a nontestifying codefendant,
         in violation of Bruton v. United States, supra, can never be harmless.<span class="sup"
            >[5]</span>Harrington, which we have expressly reaffirmed on more than one occasion,
         see, e. g., Schneble v. Florida, supra; Brown v. United States, 411 U. S. 223 (1973),
         demonstrates that the denial of the opportunity to cross-examine an adverse witness does
         not fit within the limited category of constitutional errors that are deemed prejudicial in
         every case.</p>
      <p>Respondent seeks to blunt the force of Harrington in essentially two ways. First, he
         suggests that this Court's decision in Davis v. Alaska forecloses application of
         harmless-error analysis to the particular sort of Confrontation Clause violation involved
         here, citing the following language near the end of the Court's opinion:</p> "[Davis] was
      thus denied the right of effective cross-examination which ` "would be constitutional error of
      the first magnitude and no amount of showing of want of prejudice would cure it." Brookhart v.
      Janis, 384 U. S. <span class="star-pagination">*683</span> 1, 3.'" 415 U. S., at 318 (quoting
      Smith v. Illinois, 390 U. S. 129, 131 (1968)). <p>Read properly, however, Davis does not
         support an automatic reversal rule, and the above-quoted language merely reflects the view
         that on the facts of that case the trial court's error had done "serious damage" to the
         petitioner's defense.</p>
      <p>Davis was charged with stealing a safe from a bar. The police found the stolen safe
         abandoned near the home of Richard Green, who testified at trial that he had seen Davis
         engaged in suspicious activity near this site on the day of the crime. Defense counsel was
         barred from eliciting on cross-examination that Green was on juvenile probation for
         burglary both at the time of his pretrial identification of Davis and at the time of trial.
         The defense sought to suggest that Green may have slanted his account in the State's favor
         either to shift suspicion away from himself or to avoid revocation of probation for failing
         to "cooperate." 415 U. S., at 310-311. This Court reversed Davis' conviction, emphasizing
         that Green's testimony was "crucial" and that there was a "real possibility" that pursuit
         of the excluded line of impeachment evidence would have done "[s]erious damage to the
         strength of the State's case." Id., at 319. So despite the absence of a reference to
         Chapman, Davis plainly rests on the conclusion that on the facts of that case, the error
         might well have contributed to the guilty verdict. Davis should not be read as
         establishing, without analysis, a categorical exception to the harmless-error rule.</p>
      <p>Respondent's second argument in support of a per se reversal rule is that the Confrontation
         Clause error in this case, which like Davis involved the exclusion of evidence, is
         analytically distinct from that in Harrington v. California, which involved the erroneous
         admission of harmless testimony. Because it is impossible to know how wrongfully excluded
         evidence would have affected the jury, the argument runs, reversal is mandated. But
         Harrington cannot be so easily dispatched. Respondent, like Harrington, was denied <span
            class="star-pagination">*684</span> an opportunity to cast doubt on the testimony of an
         adverse witness.<span class="sup">[6]</span> In both cases the prosecution was thus able to
         introduce evidence that was not subject to constitutionally adequate cross-examination. And
         in both cases the reviewing court should be able to decide whether the not-fully-impeached
         evidence might have affected the reliability of the factfinding process at trial.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, we hold that the constitutionally improper denial of a defendant's opportunity
         to impeach a witness for bias, like other Confrontation Clause errors, is subject to
         Chapman harmless-error analysis. The correct inquiry is whether, assuming that the damaging
         potential of the cross-examination were fully realized, a reviewing court might nonetheless
         say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Whether such an error is
         harmless in a particular case depends upon a host of factors, all readily accessible to
         reviewing courts. These factors include the importance of the witness' testimony in the
         prosecution's case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of
         evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points,
         the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength
         of the prosecution's case. Cf. Harrington, 395 U. S., at 254; Schneble v. Florida, 405 U.
         S., at 432.</p>
      <p>We believe that the determination whether the Confrontation Clause error in this case was
         harmless beyond a reasonable doubt is best left to the Delaware Supreme Court in the first
         instance. Accordingly, that court's judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for
         further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>
      <p>It is so ordered.</p>
      <p>JUSTICE WHITE, concurring in the judgment.</p>
      <p>The Sixth Amendment confers on defendants in criminal cases the right "to be confronted
         with the witnesses against" <span class="star-pagination">*685</span> them. The Court has
         interpreted these words as meaning more than being allowed to confront the witnesses
         physically, more than the right to be tried by live testimony rather than affidavits. It
         includes the opportunity for effective cross-examination of the State's witnesses. I do not
         here dispute these interpretations of the constitutional language; but they neither require
         nor advise the Court to hold, as it does today, that the Amendment is violated whenever a
         trial judge limits cross-examination of a particular witness and the jury might have
         received a significantly different impression of the witness' credibility had
         cross-examination not been curtailed, even if the limitation and its consequences could not
         possibly have had any effect on the outcome of the trial.</p>
      <p>It makes much more sense to hold that no violation of the Confrontation Clause has occurred
         unless there is some likelihood that the outcome of the trial was affected. I agree that
         the Delaware Court erred and that we should remand for consideration of prejudice, but I
         would not now hold that a constitutional violation occurred. If it is ultimately held that
         the outcome would have been the same whether or not cross-examination had been limited, no
         Sixth Amendment violation occurred in this case.</p>
      <p>I would thus treat this claim of a Sixth Amendment violation just as the majority would
         treat limitations on cross-examination that would fall within the trial judge's "wide
         latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on .
         . . cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice,
         confusion of the issues, the witness' safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only
         marginally relevant." Ante, at 679. These "reasonable" limitations are not violations at
         all, obviously because they can have no impact on the fairness of the trial. Yet the
         curtailment of cross-examination imposed in this case is said to be unreasonable and an
         infraction of the Amendment even though it may be held beyond reasonable doubt that it had
         no impact whatsoever on the result the jury reached.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*686</span> No judge welcomes or can ignore being told that
         he committed a constitutional violation, even if the conviction is saved by a
         harmless-error finding. Being advised by the Court that there is an area of
         cross-examination curtailment that is not only harmless but not a constitutional violation
         but at the same time an area of curtailment that even though harmless is an infraction of
         our fundamental charter, the judge will surely tend to permit the examination rather than
         risk being guilty of misunderstanding the constitutional requirements of a fair trial. I
         would not so undermine the authority of the judge to restrict cross-examination in a manner
         having no appreciable impact on the reliability of the outcome, particularly since the
         language and purpose of the specific provision at issue do not otherwise dictate.</p>
      <p>Even if it is ultimately held in this case that the error was harmless, as the Court is
         quite willing to assume will be the case, the judge has been declared derelict and
         commanded not again to restrict cross-examination in this manner even though he is
         convinced, and rightly so, that it has no significance whatsoever in terms of the outcome
         of the trial. With all due respect, I cannot join the Court's opinion.</p>
      <p>JUSTICE MARSHALL, dissenting.</p>
      <p>The Court today properly holds that a complete denial of cross-examination designed to
         explore the bias of a prosecution witness violates the Confrontation Clause, whether or not
         the denial influenced the outcome of the trial and whether or not the witness was important
         to the prosecution's case. Nevertheless, the Court remands in order to permit the state
         court to apply harmless-error analysis to that violation. I must respectfully dissent from
         the latter part of the Court's holding. I believe that the importance of cross-examination
         to a criminal trial is so great that a complete denial of otherwise proper
         cross-examination concerning the potential bias of a prosecution witness should lead to no
         less than a reversal of the conviction.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*687</span> In holding the Confrontation Clause applicable to
         the States, this Court referred to the right of cross-examination as "an essential and
         fundamental requirement for the kind of fair trial which is this country's constitutional
         goal." Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 405 (1965). If indeed the harmless-error doctrine
         focuses on the fairness and accuracy of a criminal trial, see ante, at 681, it is odd that
         the majority so easily applies it to a type of error that calls both fairness and accuracy
         into question to an almost unique degree.</p>
      <p>The centrality of cross-examination to the factfinding process makes it particularly
         unlikely that an appellate court can determine that a denial of cross-examination had no
         effect on the outcome of a trial.</p> "[T]he court ordinarily cannot measure whether harm
      has ensued to an appellant when he has been denied the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses
      against him, given all the risks. Had cross-examination been allowed, for example, it might
      have served to impeach a witness and thus to cast doubt on corroborating testimony, or it
      might have elicited exculpatory evidence. Only on rare occasions will an appellate court be
      able to find that the testimony of the witness was so tangential, or so well corroborated, or
      so clearly invulnerable to attack that the denial of the right to cross-examination was
      harmless." R. Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error 68-69 (1970). <p>The fact that a
         particular witness' testimony was corroborated cannot render harmless a denial of the right
         to expose his bias. Defense counsel may have valid strategic reasons for challenging one
         witness' testimony aggressively while treating a corroborating witness more gently. Jurors
         evaluating the witnesses' demeanor may choose to give great weight to the testimony of one
         witness while ignoring the similar testimony of another. In either event, denial of
         cross-examination concerning a witness' bias may deprive the defense of its best
         opportunity to expose genuine flaws in the <span class="star-pagination">*688</span>
         prosecution's case &#x97; flaws that the cold record will not reveal to an appellate
         court.</p>
      <p>Indeed, an appellate court attempting to apply harmless-error analysis is faced with a
         formidable burden. The court cannot merely satisfy itself that the jury would have reached
         the same result had the witness in question not appeared at all; it must be convinced
         beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have reached the same result even if
         cross-examination had led the jury affirmatively to believe that the witness was lying.
         Moreover, the court must conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that no evidence exculpatory
         to the defendant could have emerged from a genuinely adversarial testing of the witness. I
         think that a court can make such a determination only in the rarest of circumstances, and a
         rule of per se reversal is therefore justified.</p>
      <p>The Confrontation Clause violation in this case is especially pernicious. The jury was
         essentially misled, by the empty gesture of cross-examination, to believe that the defense
         attorney had been permitted to use all the tools at his disposal to expose weaknesses in
         Fleetwood's testimony. Having survived what appeared to be counsel's best efforts to
         undermine the witness' credibility, Fleetwood's testimony necessarily carried more weight
         with the jury than would the same testimony given without an apparent opportunity to
         cross-examine.</p>
      <p>This analysis makes it unnecessary to strain, as does the majority, to reconcile the
         apparent per se rule of Davis v. Alaska, 415 U. S. 308 (1974), with the harmless-error
         analysis employed in Harrington v. California, 395 U. S. 250 (1969), and Schneble v.
         Florida, 405 U. S. 427 (1972). I would simply hold that Davis mandates reversal whenever
         the prosecution puts a witness on the stand but the court does not permit the defense to
         cross-examine concerning relevant potential bias. I therefore dissent from the Court's
         decision to permit the Delaware Supreme Court to apply <span class="star-pagination"
            >*689</span> harmless-error analysis to the Confrontation Clause violation in this
         case.</p>
      <p>I also write to emphasize that this Court cannot require state courts to apply
         harmless-error analysis to violations of the Federal Constitution. See Connecticut v.
         Johnson, 460 U. S. 73, 88 (1983) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). While this Court
         has stated that federal law governs the application of harmless error to violations of the
         Federal Constitution, see Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 21 (1967), that cannot mean
         more than that state courts must reverse convictions when the Constitution so mandates.
         When the Constitution does not mandate a particular remedy, this Court may not "declare
         which of many admittedly constitutional [remedial] alternatives a State may choose." Id.,
         at 48 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted). We have never held that the Federal
         Constitution forbids state courts to reverse certain convictions pursuant to state
         substantive or procedural law, nor can I imagine what provision of the Constitution could
         grant us such a power. Thus the Delaware Supreme Court remains free on remand to decide
         that even though it applied the substantive standards of the Sixth Amendment to determine
         whether error occurred, its harmless-error analysis was the product of state rather than
         federal law.</p>
      <p>JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.</p>
      <p>The Court finds the way open to reverse the judgment in this case because "[t]he opinion of
         the Delaware Supreme Court, which makes use of both federal and state cases in its
         analysis, lacks the requisite `plain statement' that it rests on state grounds." Ante, at
         678, n. 3.<span class="sup">[1]</span> In so holding, the Court <span
            class="star-pagination">*690</span> continues down the path it marked in Michigan v.
         Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1037-1044 (1983), when it announced that it would henceforth presume
         jurisdiction to review state-court judgments absent a "plain statement" that such judgments
         rest on state grounds.<span class="sup">[2]</span>
      </p>
      <p>Despite the directness of the route chosen, today's destination was not foreordained.
         Unlike Michigan v. Long, this case concerns whether the Court should presume jurisdiction
         to review a state supreme court's remedy for a federal constitutional violation. Since
         courts have traditionally enjoyed broad discretion to fashion remedies &#x97; even remedies
         forbidding otherwise lawful acts &#x97; once a constitutional violation <span
            class="star-pagination">*691</span> has been proved,<span class="sup">[3]</span> the
         more logical direction would have been to presume that a state court is merely exercising
         its normal supervisory power over state officials unless it clearly states that federal law
         requires a particular procedure to be followed. The Court's contrary presumption works a
         further advancement of its own power, but it flouts this Court's best traditions: it
         deviates from our normal approach to questions of subject-matter jurisdiction, and it
         departs from our longstanding practice of reserving decision on federal constitutional law.
         Even considered purely from the standpoint of managing our own discretionary docket, the
         Court's presumption includes a selection bias inconsistent with the lessons of history as
         revealed in this Court's statutory jurisdiction over the judgments of state courts.
         Finally, the Court's willingness to presume jurisdiction to review state remedies evidences
         a lack of respect for state courts and will, I fear, be a recurrent source of friction
         between the federal and state judiciaries.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>I</h2>
      <p>The rules that govern this Court's jurisdiction to review state-court judgments should, of
         course, be consistent with the jurisdictional principles that govern the entire federal
         judicial <span class="star-pagination">*692</span> system. Indeed, because the example that
         this Court sets for the entire system inevitably affects the way in which all federal
         judges tend to evaluate their own powers, we have a special obligation to make sure that
         our conclusions concerning our own jurisdiction rest on a firm and legitimate
         foundation.</p>
      <p>In origin and design, federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction; they exercise only
         the authority conferred on them by Art. III and by congressional enactments pursuant
         thereto. See Bender v. Williamsport Area School Dist., ante, at 541, and cases cited
         therein. Like all other federal courts, this Court has only the power expressly given it.
         Because it is our inescapable duty &#x97; in contrast to that of the political branches
         &#x97; to construe authoritatively the very instruments which define and limit that power,
         the Court early in its history wisely adopted a presumption that every federal court is
         "without jurisdiction" unless "the contrary appears affirmatively from the record." King
         Bridge Co. v. Otoe County, 120 U. S. 225, 226 (1887). Accord, Thomas v. Board of Trustees,
         195 U. S. 207, 210 (1904); Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co., 194 U. S. 48, 62-63
         (1904). That presumption is just as "inflexible" in this Court as in any other federal
            court.<span class="sup">[4]</span>
      </p>
      <p>Even for cases unquestionably within this Court's subject-matter jurisdiction, we have
         disclaimed any pretension to <span class="star-pagination">*693</span> reach questions
         arising under the Federal Constitution when an alternative basis of decision fairly
         presented itself. Thus, in one of the most respected opinions ever written by a Member of
         this Court, Justice Brandeis wrote:</p> "The Court [has] developed, for its own governance
      in the cases confessedly within its jurisdiction, a series of rules under which it has avoided
      passing upon a large part of all the constitutional questions pressed upon it for decision.
      They are: ..... ". . . The Court will not pass upon a [federal] constitutional question
      although properly presented by the record, if there is also present some other ground upon
      which the case may be disposed of." Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346-347 (1936)
      (concurring opinion).<span class="sup">[5]</span>
      <p>The Court has remained faithful to these basic tenets when it is reviewing cases that arise
         in the federal system. See Bender v. Williamsport Area School Dist., ante, at 545-549;
         Regents of University of Michigan v. Ewing, 474 U. S. 214, 222-223 (1985). Ironically,
         however &#x97; and contrary to tradition<span class="sup">[6]</span> &#x97; the Court has
         taken a different stance when it is <span class="star-pagination">*694</span> asked to
         review cases coming to us from state courts. Although "[w]e cannot perform our duty to
         refrain from interfering in state law questions and also to review federal ones without
         making a determination whether the one or the other controls the judgment," Herb v.
         Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117, 125-126 (1945), the jurisdictional precepts that serve us so well
         in reviewing judgments rendered in federal court merit observance in review of state-court
         judgments too. Abjuring the federal analogy, the Court unwisely marks for special scrutiny
         the decisions of courts to which I believe it owes special respect.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>II</h2>
      <p>The jurisdictional presumption that the Court applies &#x97; and extends &#x97; today
         harbors a hidden selection bias that in turn reveals a disturbing conception of this
         Court's role. Because a state ground can only support a judgment consistent with a <span
            class="star-pagination">*695</span> federal claim, the Court's jurisdictional
         presumption operates to expand this Court's review of state remedies that over-compensate
         for violations of federal constitutional rights. Historically, however, such cases have
         been outside the province of this Court. For well over a century the Judiciary Act of 1789
         denied this Court authority to review state-court judgments upholding federal claims.<span
            class="sup">[7]</span> By conferring no power to review these judgments, "the first
         Congress assembled under the Constitution" &#x97; whose Members had "taken part in framing
         that instrument," Wisconsin v. Pelican Ins. Co., 127 U. S. 265, 297 (1888), in addition to
         having enacted the First Judiciary Act &#x97; codified their conviction that this Court's
         overriding concern was to ensure that state courts respect federal rights. Only in 1914 did
         Congress authorize this Court to take jurisdiction over state-court judgments upholding
         claims of federal constitutional right, Act of Dec. 23, 1914, 38 Stat. 790, and even that
         legislation reflected an understanding <span class="star-pagination">*696</span> that the
         Court's role is primarily to vindicate such rights.<span class="sup">[8]</span> Most of the
         bills on this subject gave "the litigant an absolute right to appeal or take a writ of
         error to <span class="star-pagination">*697</span> the Supreme Court . . . even though the
         decision is in favor of a claim of right under the Federal Constitution." S. Rep. No. 161,
         63d Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1914). Rather than adopt these bills, which would have placed
         uniformity of federal law on a par with vindication of federal rights by making review of
         such judgments at least nominally mandatory, Congress "substitute[d] a grant of
         jurisdiction to the Supreme Court of the United States to issue a writ of certiorari or
         otherwise to review the decision of the State court." Ibid. Compare Act of Sept. 24, 1789,
         § 25, 1 Stat. 85-86, with Act of Dec. 23, 1914, 38 Stat. 790. Thus, although this Court now
         has the power to review decisions defending federal constitutional rights, the claim of
         these cases on our docket is secondary to the need to scrutinize judgments disparaging
         those rights.<span class="sup">[9]</span>
         <span class="star-pagination">*698</span> When the state-court decision to be reviewed is
         ambiguous, and it is not even clear that the judgment rests on a federal ground, the basis
         for exercising jurisdiction is even less tenable.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>III</h2>
      <p>The Court's decision to monitor state-court decisions that may or may not rest on
         nonfederal grounds is not only historically disfavored but risks the very confrontations
         and tensions a more humble jurisdictional stance would avoid. The presumption applied today
         allocates the risk of error in favor of the Court's power of review; as a result, over the
         long run <span class="star-pagination">*699</span> the Court will inevitably review
         judgments that in fact rest on adequate and independent state grounds. Even if the Court is
         unconcerned by the waste inherent in review of such cases, even if it is unmoved by the
         incongruity between the wholly precatory nature of our pronouncements on such occasions and
         Art. III's prohibition of advisory opinions, it should be concerned by the inevitable
         intrusion upon the prerogatives of state courts that can only provide a potential source of
         friction and thereby threaten to undermine the respect on which we must depend for the
         faithful and conscientious application of this Court's expositions of federal law.</p>
      <p>Less obvious is the impact on mutual trust when the state court on remand &#x97; perhaps
         out of misplaced sense of duty &#x97; confines its state constitution to the boundaries
         marked by this Court for the Federal Constitution. In Montana v. Jackson, 460 U. S. 1030
         (1983), for example, this Court vacated and remanded "for further consideration in light of
         South Dakota v. Neville, 459 U. S. 553 (1983)." In so doing, this Court presumed that the
         judgment of the Montana Supreme Court did not rest on Montana's Constitution. Justice
         Sheehy, joined by the author of the state court's original opinion, rather bitterly
         disagreed:</p> "In our original opinion in this case, we had examined the rights guaranteed
      our citizens under state constitutional principles, in the light of federal constitutional
      decisions. Now the United States Supreme Court has interjected itself, commanding us in effect
      to withdraw the constitutional rights which we felt we should extend to our state citizens
      back to the limits pr[e]scribed by the federal decisions. Effectively, the United States
      Supreme Court has intruded upon the rights of the judiciary of this sovereign state. "Instead
      of knuckling under to this unjustified expansion of federal judicial power into the perimeters
      of our state power, we should show our judicial displeasure by insisting that in Montana, this
      sovereign state can interpret <span class="star-pagination">*700</span> its constitution to
      guarantee rights to its citizens greater than those guaranteed by the federal constitution.
      ..... "If a majority of this Court had the will to press the issue, we could put the question
      to the United States Supreme Court four-square, that this State judiciary has the right to
      interpret its constitution in the light of federal decisions, and to go beyond the federal
      decisions in granting and preserving rights to its citizens under its state constitution."

      <p>The Court's two-sentence analysis notwithstanding, one cannot be confident that we have not
         trenched on state prerogatives in this very case. Here, the Delaware Supreme Court applied
         a rule reversing convictions when the defendant had been totally denied the right to
         cross-examine a witness for bias. The rule was expressly found to be "consistent with Davis
         v. Alaska, 415 U. S. 308 (1974) and with our ruling in Weber [v. State, 457 A. 2d 674
         (1983),] for determining whether a violation of the confrontation clause is harmless." 486
         A. 2d 1, 7 (1984) (emphasis added and citations omitted). Weber itself emphasized that
         "[b]oth the United States and Delaware Constitutions guarantee the right of a defendant to
         confront the witnesses against him. U. S. Const. amend. VI; Del. Const. art. I, § 7." Weber
         v. State, 457 A. 2d, at 682 (footnote omitted). At no point did the Delaware Supreme Court
         imply that it reversed the defendant's conviction only because that result was compelled by
         its understanding of federal constitutional law; rather, the conclusion that its rule was
         "consistent with" a case of this Court construing the federal Confrontation Clause suggests
         that it was interested merely in respecting the bounds of federal law as opposed to
         carrying out its command. The Court rewards <span class="star-pagination">*701</span> the
         Delaware Supreme Court's circumspection by unceremoniously reversing its judgment.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>IV</h2>
      <p>I agree with JUSTICE MARSHALL that "the Delaware Supreme Court remains free on remand to
         decide that . . . its harmless-error analysis was the product of state rather than federal
         law." Ante, at 689. Because the Court's approach does nothing to minimize, and indeed
         multiplies, future occasions on which state courts may be called upon to clarify whether
         their judgments were in fact based on state law, it is appropriate to amplify the opinion I
         expressed in Massachusetts v. Upton, 466 U. S. 727, 736 (1984) (concurring in judgment),
         that the proper "sequence of analysis when an arguable violation of the State Constitution
         is disclosed by the record" is for the state court to consider the state constitutional
         claim in advance of any federal constitutional claim. In that case, I described the Oregon
         Supreme Court's practice of considering state constitutional claims before reaching issues
         of federal constitutional law:</p> " `The proper sequence is to analyze the state's law,
      including its constitutional law, before reaching a federal constitutional claim. This is
      required, not for the sake either of parochialism or of style, but because the state does not
      deny any right claimed under the federal Constitution when the claim before the court in fact
      is fully met by state law.' Sterling v. Cupp, 290 Ore. 611, 614, 625 P. 2d 123, 126 (1981)."
      Massachusetts v. Upton, 466 U. S., at 736.<span class="sup">[10]</span>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*702</span> Since that time, at least four other state courts
         have expressly endorsed the practice of considering state constitutional claims first.<span
            class="sup">[11]</span> In response to Michigan v. Long, 463 <span
            class="star-pagination">*703</span> U. S. 1032 (1983), for example, the New Hampshire
         Supreme Court concluded:</p> "When a defendant, as in this case, has invoked the
      protections of the New Hampshire Constitution, we will first address these claims. <span
         class="star-pagination">*704</span> ". . . We live under a unique concept of federalism and
      divided sovereignty between the nation and fifty States. The New Hampshire Constitution is the
      fundamental charter of our State. The sovereign people gave limited powers to the State
      government, and the Bill of Rights in part I of the New Hampshire Constitution protects the
      people from governmental excesses and potential abuses. When State constitutional issues have
      been raised, this court has a responsibility to make an independent determination of the
      protections afforded in the New Hampshire Constitution. If we ignore this duty, we fail to
      live up to our oath to defend our constitution and we help to destroy the federalism that must
      be so carefully safeguarded by our people. The Supreme Court of the State of Oregon recently
      recognized this responsibility and stated: " `The point is . . . that a state's constitutional
      guarantees. . . were meant to be and remain genuine guarantees against misuse of the state's
      governmental powers, truly independent of the rising and falling tides of federal case law
      both in method and specifics. State courts cannot abdicate their responsibility for these
      independent guarantees, at least not unless the people of the State themselves choose to
      abandon them and entrust their rights entirely to federal law.' State v. Kennedy, <span

         Federal Constitution.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*705</span> The emerging preference for state constitutional
         bases of decision in lieu of federal ones is, in my view, the analytical approach best
         suited to facilitating the independent role of state constitutions and state courts in our
         federal system. There is much wisdom in THE CHIEF JUSTICE's admonition that "State courts .
         . . are responsible first for resolving issues arising under their constitutions and
         statutes and then for passing on matters concerning federal law." Year-End Report on the
         Judiciary 18 (1981).</p>
      <p>It must be remembered that every State but Rhode Island had a written constitution by the
         close of the Revolutionary War in 1783. "[F]or the first century of this Nation's history,
         the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of the United States was solely a protection for the
         individual in relation to federal authorities. State Constitutions protected the liberties
         of the people of the several States from abuse by state authorities." Massachusetts v.
         Upton, 466 U. S., at 738-739 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). The independent
         significance of state constitutions clearly informed this Court's conclusion, in Barron v.
         The Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, <span class="citation no-link">
            <span class="volume">7</span>
            <span class="reporter">Pet.</span>
            <span class="page">243</span>
         </span>, 247-248 (1833), that the Bill of Rights applied only to the Federal
         Government:</p> "The question thus presented is, we think, of great importance, but not of
      much difficulty. "The constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United
      States for themselves, for their own <span class="star-pagination">*706</span> government, and
      not for the government of the individual states. Each state established a constitution for
      itself, and, in that constitution, provided such limitations and restrictions on the powers of
      its particular government as its judgment dictated. ". . . In their several constitutions they
      have imposed such restrictions on their respective governments as their own wisdom suggested;
      such as they deemed most proper for themselves. It is a subject on which they judge
      exclusively, and with which others interfere no farther than they are supposed to have a
      common interest." <p>While the holding of the Barron case has since been superseded by
         ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment and selective incorporation of the Bill of Rights,
         the concomitant atrophy of state constitutional theory was both unnecessary and
            unfortunate.<span class="sup">[13]</span> State constitutions preceded the Federal
         Constitution and were obviously intended to have independent significance.<span class="sup"
            >[14]</span> The frequent amendments to state <span class="star-pagination">*707</span>
         constitutions likewise presuppose their continued importance. Thus, whether the national
         minimum set by the Federal Constitution is high or low, state constitutions have their own
         unique origins, history, language, and structure &#x97; all of which warrant independent
         attention and elucidation. State courts remain primarily responsible for reviewing the
         conduct of their own executive branches, for safeguarding the rights of their citizenry,
         and for nurturing the jurisprudence of state constitutional rights which it is their
         exclusive province to expound.<span class="sup">[15]</span>

      <p>[3] Respondent asserts that this Court is without jurisdiction to hear this case because
         the Delaware Supreme Court's automatic reversal rule rests on an adequate and independent
         state ground. He argues that the rule was adopted not on the basis of federal
         constitutional law but as a prophylactic device, announced under that court's
         "superintending" authority, to "send an unequivocal message" to state trial judges about
         the importance of permitting liberal cross-examination. Brief for Respondent 41. We
         disagree. </p>
      <p>"[W]e will not assume that a state-court decision rests on adequate and independent state
         grounds when the `state court decision fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or
         to be interwoven with the federal law, and when the adequacy and independence of any
         possible state law ground is not clear from the face of the opinion.'" Caldwell v.
         Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320, 327 (1985) (quoting Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040-1041
         (1983)). The opinion of the Delaware Supreme Court, which makes use of both federal and
         state cases in its analysis, lacks the requisite "plain statement" that it rests on state
         grounds. Michigan v. Long, supra, at 1042, 1044. Indeed, the opinion makes no reference to
         any "superintending" authority, and nowhere suggests the existence of a state prophylactic
         rule designed to insure protection for a federal constitutional right. We read the decision
         below as resting on federal law.</p>
      <p>[4] The Delaware Supreme Court did not decide whether the trial court erred in preventing
         respondent from cross-examining Fleetwood about the unrelated homicide investigation. 486
         A. 2d 1, 7, n. 3 (1984). We likewise decline to consider that question.</p>
      <p>[5] Bruton had held that the receipt at a joint trial of the incriminating statement of a
         nontestifying codefendent deprived Bruton of his right to cross-examine an adverse witness.
         In Harrington, the trial court admitted the pretrial statements of two codefendants who did
         not testify. The statements implicated Harrington by placing him at the scene of the
         robbery, and their admission plainly violated Bruton. This Court nevertheless affirmed
         Harrington's conviction, over his objection that Bruton error could never be harmless.
         Noting that the wrongfully admitted evidence was cumulative and that the untainted proof of
         the defendant's guilt was overwhelming, the Court concluded that the error was harmless
         beyond a reasonable doubt. 395 U. S., at 254.</p>

         evidence from Fleetwood.</p>

      <p>[2] The principal question in Michigan v. Long was whether a state court's determination
         that a search violated the State Constitution was independent of its conclusion that it
         violated the Federal Constitution. The Court surveyed the various approaches, decided that
         "none of [them] thus far recommends itself as the preferred method," 463 U. S., at 1039,
         and then selected the presumption it did as the most administrable of the available
         choices, id., at 1041. I agreed with the Court that "we are left with a choice between two
         presumptions: one in favor of our taking jurisdiction, and one against it," id., at 1066,
         but explained that "in reviewing the decisions of state courts, the primary" &#x97;
         although not exclusive &#x97; "role of this Court is to make sure that persons who seek to
         vindicate federal rights have been fairly heard," id., at 1068 (first emphasis added). See
         Florida v. Meyers, 466 U. S. 380, 385 (1984) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) ("But we must not
         forget that a central purpose of our written Constitution, and more specifically of its
         unique creation of a life-tenured federal judiciary, was to ensure that certain rights are
         firmly secured against possible oppression by the Federal or State Governments"). Compare
         the Michigan v. Long Court's misreading of my dissent as "propos[ing] the novel view that
         this Court should never review a state court decision unless the Court wishes to vindicate
         a federal right that has been endangered." 463 U. S., at 1043, n. 8 (emphasis added).</p>
      <p>[3] See, e. g., Teachers v. Hudson, ante, at 309-310, n. 22, and cases cited therein. As I
         explained in my opinion concurring in the judgment in Connecticut v. Johnson, 460 U. S. 73,
         88 (1983) (footnotes omitted); </p>
      <p>"If federal constitutional error occurs in a state criminal trial, federal law places
         certain limits on the state appellate court's disposition of the case. If the error is
         sufficiently grievous, it must reverse. If the error is less grievous, it also must reverse
         unless it declares its conviction beyond a reasonable doubt that the federal error was
         harmless. But federal law does not require a state appellate court to make a harmless-error
         determination; it merely permits the state court to do so in appropriate cases. This is all
         the Court held in Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967)."</p>
      <p>JUSTICE MARSHALL is therefore quite right to point out that "this Court cannot require
         state courts to apply harmless-error analysis to violations of the Federal Constitution."

      <p>"The policy's ultimate foundations, some if not all of which also sustain the
         jurisdictional limitation, lie in all that goes to make up the unique place and character,
         in our scheme, of judicial review of governmental action for constitutionality. They are
         found in the delicacy of that function, particularly in view of possible consequences for
         others stemming also from constitutional roots; the comparative finality of those
         consequences; the consideration due to the judgment of other repositories of constitutional
         power concerning the scope of their authority; the necessity, if government is to function
         constitutionally, for each to keep within its power, including the courts; the inherent
         limitations of the judicial process, arising especially from its largely negative character
         and limited resources of enforcement; withal in the paramount importance of constitutional
         adjudication in our system." Id., at 568-571 (footnotes omitted).</p>
      <p>[7] Section 25 of the Act of Sept. 24, 1789, 1 Stat. 85-86, as the First Judiciary Act was
         also known, provided for review only if the validity of a treaty or of a federal or state
         statute or "authority," or the construction of a federal treaty, statute, or commission of
         the Constitution was drawn in question, and then only if "the decision [was] against their
         validity" or "against the title, right, privilege or exemption" claimed. </p>
      <p>In 1867 the post-Civil War Congress, which was not overly concerned with state sovereignty,
         revised the section to allow review without respect to questions of validity or
         construction, "where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is claimed under the
         constitution, or any treaty or statute of or commission held, or authority exercised under
         the United States." Act of Feb. 5, 1867, § 2, 14 Stat. 386. The question raised by this
         amendment, however, was not whether the Court could or should review state-court decisions
         in favor of federal constitutional claims, but whether the amendment had effected an
         implied repeal of the doctrine that the Court could review only federal questions in cases
         subject to review &#x97; a question answered emphatically in the negative in Murdock v.

         Congress actually meant to provide that "every question passed on by the State Court should
         be open for reconsideration in the Supreme Court." 2 C. Warren, The Supreme Court in United
         States History 682 (rev. ed. 1926)).</p>
      <p>[8] The legislation was a response to the New York Court of Appeals' Lochner-style
         substantive due process decision in Ives v. South Buffalo R. Co., 201 N. Y. 271, 94 N. E.
         431 (1911). See, e. g., S. Rep. No. 161, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1914); H. R. Rep. No.
         1222, 63d Cong., 3d Sess., 2-3 (1914); 52 Cong. Rec. 276 (1914) (remarks of Rep. Webb). In
         the Ives case, the Court of Appeals held New York's newly enacted workmen's compensation
         statute unconstitutional because it imposed on the railroad the obligation to pay for
         injuries for which it was not at fault. 201 N. Y., at 292-317, 94 N. E., at 439-449. By the
         1914 legislation Congress intended to redress a seeming discrimination in favor of
         railroads and other large economic interests which, under the virulent substantive due
         process doctrine of the day, could obtain review of challenges to state reform legislation
         in the Supreme Court if they lost in the highest state court, but whose judgment in state
         court was protected from review in the Supreme Court if it won. See, e. g., 52 Cong., Rec.,
         supra, at 277 (remarks of Rep. Volstead) ("The cases that are taken to the courts for the
         purpose of having a statute declared unconstitutional are, I believe, in the great majority
         of cases, taken there by the large corporate interests. . . . If they succeed in having
         those laws set aside in a State court, that ends it under the law as it now stands. The
         other side can not appeal. If they fail to have the statute declared void in a State court,
         they can appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States and have another chance there to
         effect their purpose. . . . We ought to allow equal treatment to all parties and not favor
         these large interests"). See also H. R. Rep. No. 1222, supra, at 2-3; 52 Cong. Rec., supra,
         at 276 (remarks of Rep. Webb); ibid. (quoting letter from Mr. Wheeler of New York); id., at
         277 (remarks of Rep. Lewis). </p>
      <p>Although Congress' response to the Ives case demonstrates that there are cases in which a
         state court's judgment indicating a federal claim merits review, that view is perfectly
         consistent with the traditional understanding that the primary function of this Court is to
         review decisions rejecting such claims. Indeed, the facts of Ives belie any suggestion that
         Congress intended searching review of state-court decisions upholding claims of federal
         right. The workmen's compensation legislation was of exceptional importance to the State of
         New York, as attested to by the fact that it represented the labor of a 14-person
         commission chaired by a United States Senator, 201 N. Y., at 284, 94 N. E., at 435-436, and
         was "based upon a most voluminous array of statistical tables, extracts from the works of
         philosophical writers and the industrial laws of many countries, all of which are designed
         to show that our own system of dealing with industrial accidents is economically, morally
         and legally unsound," id., at 287, 94 N. E., at 437. (In response to Ives the people of New
         York amended their Constitution to allow for legislation of this kind. S. Rep. No. 161,
         supra, at 2; H. R. Rep. No. 1222, supra, at 3.) Not only was this particular statute of
         great concern to New York, but the constitutionality of legislation of this kind was
         unsettled: "Similar laws were held constitutional in New Jersey, the State of Washington,
         and some other States." H. R. Rep. No. 1222, supra, at 2. See 52 Cong. Rec., supra, at 276
         (remarks of Rep. Webb) (New Jersey).</p>
      <p>[9] There is strong scholarly support for this view. For example, Dean Choper "submits that
         the essential role of judicial review in our system is to prevent violations of that
         category of constitutional provisions that secure individual liberties." J. Choper,
         Judicial Review and the National Political Process 2 (1980). See id., at 64-65. </p>
      <p>Professor Dworkin makes a similar point:</p>
      <p>"The institution of rights against the Government is not a gift of God, or an ancient
         ritual, or a national sport. It is a complex and troublesome practice that makes the
         Government's job of securing the general benefit more difficult and more expensive, and it
         would be a frivolous and wrongful practice unless it served some point. Anyone who
         professes to take rights seriously, and who praises our Government for respecting them,
         must have some sense of what that point is. He must accept, at the minimum, one or both of
         two important ideas. The first is the vague but powerful idea of human dignity. This idea,
         associated with Kant, but defended by philosophers of different schools, supposes that
         there are ways of treating a man that are inconsistent with recognizing him as a full
         member of the human community, and holds that such treatment is profoundly unjust.</p>
      <p>"The second is the more familiar idea of political equality. This supposes that the weaker
         members of a political community are entitled to the same concern and respect of their
         government as the more powerful members have secured for themselves, so that if some men
         have freedom of decision whatever the effect on the general good, then all men must have
         the same freedom. I do not want to defend or elaborate these ideas here, but only to insist
         that anyone who claims that citizens have rights must accept ideas very close to these.</p>
      <p>"It makes sense to say that a man has a fundamental right against the Government, in the
         strong sense, like free speech, if that right is necessary to protect his dignity, or his
         standing as equally entitled to concern and respect, or some other personal value of like
         consequence. It does not make sense otherwise.</p>
      <p>"So if rights make sense at all, then the invasion of a relatively important right must be
         a very serious matter. It means treating a man as less than a man, or as less worthy of
         concern than other men. The institution of rights rests on the conviction that this is a
         grave injustice, and that it is worth paying the incremental cost in social policy or
         efficiency that is necessary to prevent it. But then it must be wrong to say that inflating
         rights is as serious as invading them. If the Government errs on the side of the
         individual, then it simply pays a little more in social efficiency than it has to pay; it
         pays a little more, that is, of the same coin that it has already decided must be spent.
         But if it errs against the individual it inflicts an insult upon him that, on its own
         reckoning, it is worth a great deal of that coin to avoid." R. Dworkin, Takings Rights
         Seriously 198-199 (1977).</p>
      <p>[10] "[T]he basis for th[e] claim in the state constitution should be examined first,
         before any issue under the federal fourteenth amendment. To begin with the federal claim,
         as is customarily done, implicitly admits that the guarantees of the state's constitution
         are ineffective to protect the asserted right and that only the intervention of the federal
         constitution stands between the claimant and the state. . . . [I]nsofar as the federal
         fourteenth amendment is invoked to apply the federal Bill of Rights against state action,
         particularly in the fields of freedom of ideas, criminal procedure, and compensation for
         the taking of property, there is no reason to accept such an assumption that the values
         enshrined in a state's constitution, in, say, 1859, must today fall short of those in the
         federal Bill of Rights of 1789. And to add a reference to the corresponding state provision
         as an after thought to a holding under the federal guarantee is worse than merely
         backwards: A holding that a state constitutional provision protects the asserted claim in
         fact destroys the premise for a holding that the state is denying what the federal
         Constitution would assure." Linde, Without "Due Process", 49 Ore. L. Rev. 125, 182 (1970). </p>

         vast differences between the federal and state constitutions and courts. Second, the
         histories of the United States and Washington Constitutions clearly demonstrate that the

         a separate and important function of our state constitution and courts that is closely

         proper respect to our own legal foundations and fulfill our sovereign duties. Third, by
         turning first to our own constitution we can develop a body of independent jurisprudence

         constitutional provisions develop a principled, responsible body of law that will not
         appear to have been constructed to meet the whim of the moment. Finally, to apply the

         cards. As Justice Linde has noted:</p>
      <p>`People do not claim rights against self-incrimination, they "take the fifth" and expect
         "Miranda warnings." Unlawful searches are equated with fourth amendment violations.

      <p>[14] The early state Bills of Rights were, in fact, specifically motivated by the interest
         in protecting the individual against overreaching by the majority: </p>
      <p>"In the period following independence, the state legislatures became increasingly active,
         enacting a great variety of laws. To many Americans much of this legislation appeared to
         serve the special interests of some groups at the expense of others. Moreover, much of it
         was thought to violate the natural rights of individuals. For example, the Pennsylvania
         Council of Censors issued a report in 1784 that listed many examples of legislative
         violations of the state constitution and bill of rights. The report showed that `fines had
         been remitted, judicially established claims disallowed, verdicts of juries set aside, the
         property of one given to another, defective titles secured, marriages dissolved,' and so
         forth. Similar abuses were also taking place in New Hampshire and other states. The
         injustice of these laws, as James Madison said, brought `into question the fundamental
         principle of republican Government, that the majority who rule in such governments are the
         safest Guardians both of public Good and private rights.' By the end of the 1780's, `the
         Americans' inveterate suspicion and jealousy of political power, once concentrated almost
         exclusively on the Crown and its agents, was transferred to the various state
         legislatures.'</p>
      <p>.....</p>
      <p>"As Americans became more distrustful of democracy, Whig political theory gradually
         declined and Federalist theory became predominant. Americans began to impose greater
         restrictions on their legislatures in order to safeguard individual rights. In the 1770's
         and 1780's more and more rights were added to bills of rights. Moreover, the power of the
         legislatures to limit or alienate rights was steadily reduced. Increasingly, bills of
         rights became binding on legislatures. Instead of saying merely that the legislature
         `ought' not abridge certain rights, bills of rights began to provide that it `shall' not do
         so. The prevailing view among the Federalists was that the authority of the legislature and
         of government generally should extend only to a relatively narrow range of issues.</p>
      <p>"In summary, during the revolutionary period a `tidal-wave of democracy. . . swept over the
         colonies.' Thereafter, during the 1780's, those waters receded and another wave swept in: a
         wave of concern about protecting `private rights against uncontrolled legislative power.'"

      <p>[15] This would facilitate the work of federal courts, which under this Court's precedents
         must address issues of state constitutional law before considering claims under the Federal
         Constitution. See City of Mesquite v. Aladdin's Castle, Inc., 455 U. S. 283, 294-295 (1982)
         ("[T]here is no need for decision of the federal [constitutional] issue" if the state
         constitution provides "independent support"); cf. Askew v. Hargrave, 401 U. S. 476, 478
         (1971) (abstention under Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., 312 U. S. 496 (1941)); Reetz v.
         Bozanich, 397 U. S. 82, 85 (1970) (same). There exists a growing recognition among Federal
         Courts of Appeals that it is incumbent upon them to resolve issues of state constitutional
