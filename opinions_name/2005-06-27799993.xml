  <body><div>(Slip Opinion) OCTOBER TERM, 2004 1&#xD; &#xD; Syllabus&#xD; &#xD; NOTE: Where it is
    feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is&#xD; being done in connection with this
    case, at the time the opinion is issued.&#xD; The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of
    the Court but has been&#xD; prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the
    reader.&#xD; See United States v. Detroit Timber &amp; Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.&#xD;
    &#xD; &#xD; SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&#xD; &#xD; Syllabus&#xD; &#xD; MCCREARY COUNTY,
    KENTUCKY, ET AL. v. AMERI-&#xD; CAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF KENTUCKY ET AL.&#xD; &#xD;
    CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&#xD; THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&#xD; &#xD; No.
    03–1693. Argued March 2, 2005—Decided June 27, 2005&#xD; After petitioners, two Kentucky
    Counties, each posted large, readily&#xD; visible copies of the Ten Commandments in their
    courthouses, re-&#xD; spondents, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) et al., sued&#xD;
    under 42 U. S. C. §1983 to enjoin the displays on the ground that&#xD; they violated the First
    Amendment’s Establishment Clause. The&#xD; Counties then adopted nearly identical resolutions
    calling for a more&#xD; extensive exhibit meant to show that the Commandments are Ken-&#xD;
    tucky’s “precedent legal code.” The resolutions noted several grounds&#xD; for taking that
    position, including the state legislature’s acknowl-&#xD; edgment of Christ as the “Prince of
    Ethics.” The displays around the&#xD; Commandments were modified to include eight smaller,
    historical&#xD; documents containing religious references as their sole common ele-&#xD; ment,
    e.g., the Declaration of Independence’s “endowed by their Crea-&#xD; tor” passage. Entering a
    preliminary injunction, the District Court&#xD; followed the Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602,
    test to find, inter alia,&#xD; that the original display lacked any secular purpose because the
    Com-&#xD; mandments are a distinctly religious document, and that the second&#xD; version lacked
    such a purpose because the Counties narrowly tailored&#xD; their selection of foundational
    documents to those specifically referring&#xD; to Christianity. After changing counsel, the
    Counties revised the ex-&#xD; hibits again. No new resolution authorized the new exhibits, nor
    did&#xD; the Counties repeal the resolutions that preceded the second one.&#xD; The new posting,
    entitled “The Foundations of American Law and&#xD; Government Display,” consists of nine framed
    documents of equal&#xD; size. One sets out the Commandments explicitly identified as the&#xD;
    “King James Version,” quotes them at greater length, and explains&#xD; that they have profoundly
    influenced the formation of Western legal&#xD; 2 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL
    LIBERTIES&#xD; &#xD; UNION OF KY. &#xD; &#xD; Syllabus &#xD; &#xD; &#xD; thought and this
    Nation. With the Commandments are framed cop-&#xD; ies of, e.g., the Star Spangled Banner’s
    lyrics and the Declaration of&#xD; Independence, accompanied by statements about their
    historical and&#xD; legal significance. On the ACLU’s motion, the District Court in-&#xD; cluded
    this third display in the injunction despite the Counties’ pro-&#xD; fessed intent to show that
    the Commandments were part of the foun-&#xD; dation of American Law and Government and to
    educate County&#xD; citizens as to the documents. The court took proclaiming the Com-&#xD;
    mandments’ foundational value as a religious, rather than secular,&#xD; purpose under Stone v.
    Graham, 449 U. S. 39, and found that the&#xD; Counties’ asserted educational goals crumbled upon
    an examination of&#xD; this litigation’s history. Affirming, the Sixth Circuit stressed
    that,&#xD; under Stone, displaying the Commandments bespeaks a religious ob-&#xD; ject unless
    they are integrated with a secular message. The court&#xD; saw no integration here because of a
    lack of a demonstrated analyti-&#xD; cal or historical connection between the Commandments and
    the&#xD; other documents.&#xD; Held:&#xD; 1. A determination of the Counties’ purpose is a sound
    basis for rul-&#xD; ing on the Establishment Clause complaints. The Counties’ objective&#xD; may
    be dispositive of the constitutional enquiry. Pp. 10–19.&#xD; (a) Lemon’s “secular legislative
    purpose” enquiry, 403 U. S., at&#xD; 612, has been a common, albeit seldom dispositive, element
    of this&#xD; Court’s cases, Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 75. When the govern-&#xD; ment
    acts with the ostensible and predominant purpose of advancing&#xD; religion, it violates the
    central Establishment Clause value of official&#xD; religious neutrality, there being no
    neutrality when the government’s&#xD; ostensible object is to take sides. Corporation of
    Presiding Bishop of&#xD; Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S.
    327,&#xD; 335. A purpose to favor one faith over another, or adherence to relig-&#xD; ion
    generally, clashes with the “understanding . . . that liberty and&#xD; social stability demand a
    . . . tolerance that respects the religious&#xD; views of all citizens.” Zelman v.
    Simmons-Harris, 536 U. S. 639, 718.&#xD; Pp. 11–12.&#xD; (b) The Court declines the Counties’
    request to abandon Lemon’s&#xD; purpose test. Their assertions that true “purpose” is
    unknowable,&#xD; and its search merely an excuse for courts to act selectively and un-&#xD;
    predictably in picking out evidence of subjective intent, are as seismic&#xD; as they are
    unconvincing. Examination of purpose is a staple of&#xD; statutory interpretation for every
    American appellate court, e.g.,&#xD; General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S.
    581, 600,&#xD; and governmental purpose is a key element of a good deal of constitu-&#xD; tional
    doctrine, e.g., Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229. Scrutinizing&#xD; purpose makes practical
    sense in Establishment Clause analysis,&#xD; Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005) 3&#xD; &#xD;
    Syllabus&#xD; &#xD; where an understanding of official objective emerges from readily&#xD;
    discoverable fact set forth in a statute’s text, legislative history, and&#xD; implementation or
    comparable official act. Wallace v. Jaffree, 472&#xD; U. S., at 73–74. Nor is there any
    indication that the purpose enquiry&#xD; is rigged in practice to finding a religious purpose
    dominant every&#xD; time a case is filed. Pp. 12–15.&#xD; (c) The Court also avoids the
    Counties’ alternative tack of trivial-&#xD; izing the purpose enquiry. They would read the
    Court’s cases as if&#xD; the enquiry were so naive that any transparent claim to secularity&#xD;
    would satisfy it, and they would cut context out of the enquiry, to the&#xD; point of ignoring
    history, no matter what bearing it actually had on&#xD; the significance of current
    circumstances. There is no precedent for&#xD; these arguments, or reason supporting them. Pp.
    15–19.&#xD; (1) A legislature’s stated reasons will generally warrant the&#xD; deference owed in
    the first instance to such official claims, but Lemon&#xD; requires the secular purpose to be
    genuine, not a sham, and not&#xD; merely secondary to a religious objective, see, e.g., Santa Fe
    Inde-&#xD; pendent School Dist. v. Doe, 530 U. S. 290, 308. In those unusual&#xD; cases where
    the claim was an apparent sham, or the secular purpose&#xD; secondary, the unsurprising results
    have been findings of no ade-&#xD; quate secular object, as against a predominantly religious
    one. See,&#xD; e.g., Stone, supra, at 41. Pp. 15–17.&#xD; (2) The Counties’ argument that
    purpose in a case like this&#xD; should be inferred only from the latest in a series of
    governmental ac-&#xD; tions, however close they may all be in time and subject, bucks com-&#xD;
    mon sense. Reasonable observers have reasonable memories, and the&#xD; Court’s precedents
    sensibly forbid an observer “to turn a blind eye to&#xD; the context in which [the] policy
    arose.” Santa Fe, supra, at 315.&#xD; Pp. 17–19.&#xD; 2. Evaluation of the Counties’ claim of
    secular purpose for the ul-&#xD; timate displays may take their evolution into account. The
    develop-&#xD; ment of the presentation should be considered in determining its&#xD; purpose. Pp.
    19–26.&#xD; (a) Stone is the Court’s initial benchmark as its only case dealing&#xD; with the
    constitutionality of displaying the Commandments. It rec-&#xD; ognized that the Commandments are
    an “instrument of religion” and&#xD; that, at least on the facts before the Court, their text’s
    display could&#xD; presumptively be understood as meant to advance religion: although&#xD; state
    law specifically required their posting in classrooms, their iso-&#xD; lated exhibition did not
    allow even for an argument that secular edu-&#xD; cation explained their being there. 449 U. S.,
    at 41, n. 3. But Stone&#xD; did not purport to decide the constitutionality of every possible
    way&#xD; the government might set out the Commandments, and under the&#xD; Establishment Clause
    detail is key, County of Allegheny v. American&#xD; 4 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL
    LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD; Syllabus&#xD; &#xD; Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh
    Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 595.&#xD; Hence, the Court looks to the record showing the progression
    leading up&#xD; to the Commandments’ third display, beginning with the first. Pp. 19–&#xD;
    20.&#xD; (b) There are two obvious similarities between the display Stone&#xD; rejected and the
    first one here: both set out the Commandments’ text&#xD; as distinct from any traditionally
    symbolic representation like blank&#xD; tablets, and each stood alone, not as part of an
    arguably secular dis-&#xD; play. Stone stressed the significance of integrating the
    Command-&#xD; ments into a secular scheme to forestall the broadcast of an otherwise&#xD;
    clearly religious message, 449 U. S., at 42, and for good reason, the&#xD; Commandments being a
    central point of reference in the religious&#xD; and moral history of Jews and Christians. They
    proclaim the exis-&#xD; tence of a monotheistic god (no other gods), regulate details of
    reli-&#xD; gious obligation (no graven images, sabbath breaking, or vain oath&#xD; swearing),
    and unmistakably rest even the universally accepted pro-&#xD; hibitions (as against murder,
    theft, etc.) on the sanction of the divin-&#xD; ity proclaimed at the text’s beginning.
    Displaying that text is thus&#xD; different from symbolic representation, like tablets with 10
    roman&#xD; numerals, which could be seen as alluding to a general notion of law,&#xD; not a
    sectarian conception of faith. Where the text is set out, the in-&#xD; sistence of the religious
    message is hard to avoid in the absence of a&#xD; context plausibly suggesting a message going
    beyond an excuse to&#xD; promote the religious point of view. The display in Stone had no
    such&#xD; context, and the Counties’ solo exhibit here did nothing more to&#xD; counter the
    sectarian implication than the Stone postings. The rea-&#xD; sonable observer could only think
    that the Counties meant to empha-&#xD; size and celebrate the Commandments’ religious message.
    Pp. 20–21.&#xD; (c) The Counties’ second display, unlike the first, did not hang&#xD; the
    Commandments in isolation, but included the statement of the&#xD; government’s purpose expressly
    set out in the county resolutions, and&#xD; underscored it by juxtaposing the Commandments to
    other docu-&#xD; ments whose references to God were highlighted as their sole com-&#xD; mon
    element. The display’s unstinting focus was on religious pas-&#xD; sages, showing that the
    Counties posted the Commandments&#xD; precisely because of their sectarian content. That
    demonstration of&#xD; the government’s objective was enhanced by serial religious refer-&#xD;
    ences and the accompanying resolutions’ claim about the embodiment&#xD; of ethics in Christ.
    Together, the display and resolution presented an&#xD; indisputable, and undisputed, showing of
    an impermissible purpose.&#xD; Pp. 21–22.&#xD; (d) The lower courts’ conclusion that no
    legitimizing secular pur-&#xD; pose prompted the Counties’ third display, the “Foundations
    of&#xD; American Law and Government” exhibit, is amply justified. That dis-&#xD; Cite as: 545 U.
    S. ____ (2005) 5&#xD; &#xD; Syllabus&#xD; &#xD; play placed the Commandments in the company of
    other documents&#xD; the Counties deemed especially significant in the historical founda-&#xD;
    tion of American government. In trying to persuade the District Court&#xD; to lift the
    preliminary injunction, the Counties cited several new pur-&#xD; poses for the third version,
    including a desire to educate County citi-&#xD; zens as to the significance of the documents
    displayed. The Counties’&#xD; claims, however, persuaded neither that court, which was
    intimately&#xD; familiar with this litigation’s details, nor the Sixth Circuit. Where&#xD; both
    lower courts were unable to discern an arguably valid secular&#xD; purpose, this Court normally
    should hesitate to find one. Edwards v.&#xD; Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 594. The Counties’ new
    statements of pur-&#xD; pose were presented only as a litigating position, there being no
    fur-&#xD; ther authorizing resolutions by the Counties’ governing boards. And&#xD; although
    repeal of the earlier county authorizations would not have&#xD; erased them from the record of
    evidence bearing on current purpose,&#xD; the extraordinary resolutions for the second displays
    passed just&#xD; months earlier were not repealed or otherwise repudiated. Indeed,&#xD; the
    sectarian spirit of the resolutions found enhanced expression in&#xD; the third display, which
    quoted more of the Commandment’s purely&#xD; religious language than the first two displays had
    done. No reason-&#xD; able observer, therefore, could accept the claim that the Counties
    had&#xD; cast off the objective so unmistakable in the earlier displays. Nor did&#xD; the
    selection of posted material suggest a clear theme that might&#xD; prevail over evidence of the
    continuing religious object. For example,&#xD; it is at least odd in a collection of documents
    said to be “foundational”&#xD; to include a patriotic anthem, but to omit the Fourteenth
    Amend-&#xD; ment, the most significant structural provision adopted since the&#xD; original
    framing. An observer would probably suspect the Counties&#xD; of reaching for any way to keep a
    religious document on the walls of&#xD; courthouses constitutionally required to embody
    religious neutrality.&#xD; Pp. 22–25.&#xD; (e) In holding that the preliminary injunction was
    adequately&#xD; supported by evidence that the Counties’ purpose had not changed at&#xD; the
    third stage, the Court does not decide that the Counties’ past ac-&#xD; tions forever taint any
    effort on their part to deal with the subject&#xD; matter. The Court holds only that purpose is
    to be taken seriously&#xD; under the Establishment Clause and is to be understood in light
    of&#xD; context. District courts are fully capable of adjusting preliminary re-&#xD; lief to
    take account of genuine changes in constitutionally significant&#xD; conditions. Nor does the
    Court hold that a sacred text can never be&#xD; integrated constitutionally into a governmental
    display on law or his-&#xD; tory. Its own courtroom frieze depicts Moses holding tablets
    exhibit-&#xD; ing a portion of the secularly phrased Commandments; in the com-&#xD; pany of 17
    other lawgivers, most of them secular figures, there is no&#xD; 6 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN
    CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD; Syllabus&#xD; &#xD; risk that Moses would strike an
    observer as evidence that the Na-&#xD; tional Government was violating religious neutrality. P.

    _________________&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; MCCREARY COUNTY, KENTUCKY, ET AL., PETI-&#xD; TIONERS v.
    AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KENTUCKY ET AL.&#xD; ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
    STATES COURT OF&#xD; APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&#xD; [June 27, 2005]&#xD; &#xD; JUSTICE
    SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.&#xD; Executives of two counties posted a version of
    the Ten&#xD; Commandments on the walls of their courthouses. After&#xD; suits were filed
    charging violations of the Establishment&#xD; Clause, the legislative body of each county
    adopted a&#xD; resolution calling for a more extensive exhibit meant to&#xD; show that the
    Commandments are Kentucky’s “precedent&#xD; legal code,” Def. Exh. 1 in Memorandum in Support
    of&#xD; Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss in Civ. A. No. 99–507, p. 1&#xD; (ED Ky.) (hereinafter
    Def. Exh. 1). The result in each&#xD; instance was a modified display of the Commandments&#xD;
    surrounded by texts containing religious references as&#xD; their sole common element. After
    changing counsel, the&#xD; counties revised the exhibits again by eliminating some&#xD;
    documents, expanding the text set out in another, and&#xD; adding some new ones.&#xD; The issues
    are whether a determination of the counties’&#xD; purpose is a sound basis for ruling on the
    Establishment&#xD; Clause complaints, and whether evaluation of the coun-&#xD; ties’ claim of
    secular purpose for the ultimate displays&#xD; 2 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL
    LIBERTIES&#xD; &#xD; UNION OF KY. &#xD; &#xD; Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; may take
    their evolution into account. We hold that the&#xD; counties’ manifest objective may be
    dispositive of the&#xD; constitutional enquiry, and that the development of the&#xD;
    presentation should be considered when determining its&#xD; purpose.&#xD; I&#xD; In the summer
    of 1999, petitioners McCreary County&#xD; and Pulaski County, Kentucky (hereinafter Counties),
    put&#xD; up in their respective courthouses large, gold-framed&#xD; copies of an abridged text
    of the King James version of the&#xD; Ten Commandments, including a citation to the Book of&#xD;
    Exodus.1 In McCreary County, the placement of the Com-&#xD; mandments responded to an order of
    the county legislative&#xD; body requiring “the display [to] be posted in ‘a very high&#xD;
    traffic area’ of the courthouse.” <span class="citation no-link">

    </span>, 684&#xD; (ED Ky. 2000). In Pulaski County, amidst reported con-&#xD; troversy over the
    propriety of the display, the Command-&#xD; ments were hung in a ceremony presided over by
    the&#xD; county Judge-Executive, who called them “good rules to&#xD; live by” and who recounted
    the story of an astronaut who&#xD; became convinced “there must be a divine God” after&#xD;
    viewing the Earth from the moon. Dodson, Common-&#xD; wealth Journal, Jul. 25, 1999, p. A1, col.
    2, in Memoran-&#xD; dum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary In-&#xD; junction in
    Civ. A. No. 99–509 (ED Ky.) (internal&#xD; quotation marks omitted). The Judge-Executive
    was&#xD; accompanied by the pastor of his church, who called the&#xD; Commandments “a creed of
    ethics” and told the press after&#xD; the ceremony that displaying the Commandments was&#xD;
    “one of the greatest things the judge could have done to&#xD; close out the millennium.” Id., at

    the Commandments posted:&#xD; “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.&#xD; “Thou shalt not
    make unto thee any graven images.&#xD; “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in&#xD;
    vain.&#xD; “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.&#xD; “Honor thy father and thy

    A.&#xD; No. 99–507 (ED Ky.) (hereinafter Def. Exh. 9).&#xD; In each county, the hallway display
    was “readily visible to&#xD; . . . county citizens who use the courthouse to conduct&#xD; their

    UNION OF KY. &#xD; &#xD; Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; First Amendment of the
    Constitution.3 Within a month,&#xD; and before the District Court had responded to the
    request&#xD; for injunction, the legislative body of each County author-&#xD; ized a second,
    expanded display, by nearly identical reso-&#xD; lutions reciting that the Ten Commandments are
    “the&#xD; precedent legal code upon which the civil and criminal&#xD; codes of . . . Kentucky
    are founded,” and stating several&#xD; grounds for taking that position: that “the Ten Com-&#xD;
    mandments are codified in Kentucky’s civil and criminal&#xD; laws”; that the Kentucky House of
    Representatives had in&#xD; 1993 “voted unanimously . . . to adjourn . . . ‘in remem-&#xD;
    brance and honor of Jesus Christ, the Prince of Ethics’ ”;&#xD; that the “County Judge and . . .
    magistrates agree with&#xD; the arguments set out by Judge [Roy] Moore” in defense of&#xD; his
    “display [of] the Ten Commandments in his court-&#xD; room”; and that the “Founding Father[s]
    [had an] explicit&#xD; understanding of the duty of elected officials to publicly&#xD;
    acknowledge God as the source of America’s strength and&#xD; direction.” Def. Exh. 1, at 1–3,
    6.&#xD; As directed by the resolutions, the Counties expanded&#xD; the displays of the Ten
    Commandments in their locations,&#xD; presumably along with copies of the resolution, which&#xD;
    instructed that it, too, be posted, id., at 9. In addition to&#xD; the first display’s large
    framed copy of the edited King&#xD; James version of the Commandments,4 the second in-&#xD;

    through the Fourteenth Amendment.&#xD; Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, 530 U. S. 290,
    301 (2000)&#xD; 4 The District Court noted that there was some confusion as to&#xD; &#xD;
    whether the Ten Commandments hung independently in the second&#xD; display, or were incorporated
    into the copy of the page from the Con-&#xD; gressional Record declaring 1983 “the Year of the
    Bible.” 96 F. Supp.&#xD; 2d, at 684, and n. 4; 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 695–696, and n. 4. The

    frames, each&#xD; either having a religious theme or excerpted to highlight a&#xD; religious
    element. The documents were the “endowed by&#xD; their Creator” passage from the Declaration of
    Independ-&#xD; ence; the Preamble to the Constitution of Kentucky; the&#xD; national motto, “In
    God We Trust”; a page from the Con-&#xD; gressional Record of February 2, 1983, proclaiming
    the&#xD; Year of the Bible and including a statement of the Ten&#xD; Commandments; a
    proclamation by President Abraham&#xD; Lincoln designating April 30, 1863, a National Day
    of&#xD; Prayer and Humiliation; an excerpt from President Lin-&#xD; coln’s “Reply to Loyal
    Colored People of Baltimore upon&#xD; Presentation of a Bible,” reading that “[t]he Bible is
    the&#xD; best gift God has ever given to man”; a proclamation by&#xD; President Reagan marking
    1983 the Year of the Bible; and&#xD; the Mayflower Compact. 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 684; 96&#xD; F.
    Supp. 2d, at 695–696.&#xD; After argument, the District Court entered a prelimi-&#xD; nary
    injunction on May 5, 2000, ordering that the “display&#xD; . . . be removed from [each] County
    Courthouse&#xD; IMMEDIATELY” and that no county official “erect or&#xD; cause to be erected
    similar displays.” 96 F. Supp. 2d, at&#xD; 691; 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 702–703. The court’s analysis
    of&#xD; the situation followed the three-part formulation first&#xD; stated in Lemon v.
    Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971). As to&#xD; governmental purpose, it concluded that the original
    display&#xD; “lack[ed] any secular purpose” because the Commandments&#xD; “are a distinctly
    religious document, believed by many&#xD; Christians and Jews to be the direct and revealed word
    of&#xD; God.” 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 686; 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 698.&#xD; Although the Counties had
    maintained that the original&#xD; ——————&#xD; of the second display in this Court. “[After

    either format.&#xD; 6 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; &#xD; UNION OF KY. &#xD;
    &#xD; Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; display was meant to be educational, “[t]he narrow
    scope of&#xD; the display—a single religious text unaccompanied by any&#xD; interpretation
    explaining its role as a foundational docu-&#xD; ment—can hardly be said to present meaningfully
    the story&#xD; of this country’s religious traditions.” 96 F. Supp. 2d, at&#xD; 686–687; 96 F.
    Supp. 2d, at 698. The court found that the&#xD; second version also “clearly lack[ed] a secular
    purpose”&#xD; because the “Count[ies] narrowly tailored [their] selection of&#xD; foundational
    documents to incorporate only those with&#xD; specific references to Christianity.”5 96 F. Supp.
    2d, at 687;&#xD; 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 699.&#xD; The Counties filed a notice of appeal from the
    prelimi-&#xD; nary injunction but voluntarily dismissed it after hiring&#xD; new lawyers. They
    then installed another display in each&#xD; courthouse, the third within a year. No new
    resolution&#xD; authorized this one, nor did the Counties repeal the reso-&#xD; lutions that
    preceded the second. The posting consists of&#xD; nine framed documents of equal size, one of
    them setting&#xD; out the Ten Commandments explicitly identified as the&#xD; “King James
    Version” at Exodus 20:3–17, <span class="citation no-link">

    to&#xD; the Kentucky Constitution, and a picture of Lady Justice.&#xD; The collection is
    entitled “The Foundations of American&#xD; Law and Government Display” and each document
    comes&#xD; with a statement about its historical and legal signifi-&#xD; cance. The comment on
    the Ten Commandments reads:&#xD; “The Ten Commandments have profoundly influenced&#xD; the
    formation of Western legal thought and the forma-&#xD; tion of our country. That influence is
    clearly seen in&#xD; the Declaration of Independence, which declared that&#xD; ‘We hold these
    truths to be self-evident, that all men&#xD; are created equal, that they are endowed by
    their&#xD; Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among&#xD; these are Life, Liberty, and
    the pursuit of Happiness.’&#xD; 8 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; &#xD; UNION
    OF KY. &#xD; &#xD; Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; The Ten Commandments provide the moral
    back-&#xD; ground of the Declaration of Independence and the&#xD; foundation of our legal
    tradition.” Id., at 180a.&#xD; The ACLU moved to supplement the preliminary in-&#xD; junction to
    enjoin the Counties’ third display,6 and the&#xD; Counties responded with several explanations
    for the new&#xD; version, including desires “to demonstrate that the Ten&#xD; Commandments were
    part of the foundation of American&#xD; Law and Government” and “to educate the citizens of
    the&#xD; county regarding some of the documents that played a&#xD; significant role in the
    foundation of our system of law and&#xD; government.” 145 F. Supp. 2d, at 848 (internal
    quotation&#xD; marks omitted). The court, however, took the objective of&#xD; proclaiming the
    Commandments’ foundational value as “a&#xD; religious, rather than secular, purpose” under Stone
    v.&#xD; Graham, 449 U. S. 39 (1980) (per curiam), 145 F. Supp. 2d,&#xD; at 849, and found that
    the assertion that the Counties’&#xD; broader educational goals are secular “crumble[s] . . .
    upon&#xD; an examination of the history of this litigation,” Ibid. In&#xD; light of the
    Counties’ decision to post the Commandments&#xD; by themselves in the first instance, contrary
    to Stone, and&#xD; later to “accentuat[e]” the religious objective by surround-&#xD; ing the
    Commandments with “specific references to Chris-&#xD; tianity,” the District Court understood
    the Counties’&#xD; “clear” purpose as being to post the Commandments, not&#xD; to educate.7 145
    F. Supp. 2d, at 849–850 (internal quota-&#xD; tion marks omitted).&#xD; ——————&#xD; 6 Before the

    </span>, 847 (ED Ky. 2001).&#xD; 7 The Court also found that the effect of the third display was
    to en-&#xD; &#xD; dorse religion because the “reasonable observer will see one religious&#xD;
    code placed alongside eight political or patriotic documents, and will&#xD; understand that the
    counties promote that one religious code as being&#xD; on a par with our nation’s most cherished
    secular symbols and docu-&#xD; ments” and because the “reasonable observer [would know]
    something&#xD; Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005) 9&#xD; &#xD; Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; As
    requested, the trial court supplemented the injunc-&#xD; tion, and a divided panel of the Court
    of Appeals for the&#xD; Sixth Circuit affirmed. The Circuit majority stressed that&#xD; under
    Stone, displaying the Commandments bespeaks a&#xD; religious object unless they are integrated
    with other&#xD; material so as to carry “a secular message,” 354 F. 3d 438,&#xD; 449 (2003). The
    majority judges saw no integration here&#xD; because of a “lack of a demonstrated analytical or
    histori-&#xD; cal connection [between the Commandments and] the&#xD; other documents.” Id., at
    451. They noted in particular&#xD; that the Counties offered no support for their claim
    that&#xD; the Ten Commandments “provide[d] the moral backdrop”&#xD; to the Declaration of
    Independence or otherwise “pro-&#xD; foundly influenced” it. Ibid. (Internal quotation
    marks&#xD; omitted). The majority found that the Counties’ purpose&#xD; was religious, not
    educational, given the nature of the&#xD; Commandments as “an active symbol of religion
    [stating]&#xD; ‘the religious duties of believers,’ ” Id., at 455. The judges&#xD; in the
    majority understood the identical displays to em-&#xD; phasize “a single religious influence,
    with no mention of&#xD; any other religious or secular influences,” id., at 454, and&#xD; they
    took the very history of the litigation as evidence of&#xD; the Counties’ religious objective,
    id., at 457.&#xD; Judge Ryan dissented on the basis of wide recognition&#xD; that religion, and
    the Ten Commandments in particular,&#xD; have played a foundational part in the evolution of
    Ameri-&#xD; can law and government; he saw no reason to gainsay the&#xD; Counties’ claim of
    secular purposes. Id., at 472–473. The&#xD; dissent denied that the prior displays should have
    any&#xD; bearing on the constitutionality of the current one: a “his-&#xD; tory of
    unconstitutional displays can[not] be used as a&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; —————— &#xD; &#xD; of the
    controversy surrounding these displays, which has focused on &#xD; &#xD; only one of the nine
    framed documents: the Ten Commandments.” Id., &#xD; &#xD; at 851, 852. &#xD; &#xD; 10 MCCREARY
    COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD; Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; sword
    to strike down an otherwise constitutional display.”8&#xD; Id., at 478.&#xD; We granted
    certiorari, 543 U. S. ___ (2004), and now&#xD; affirm.&#xD; II&#xD; Twenty-five years ago in a
    case prompted by posting the&#xD; Ten Commandments in Kentucky’s public schools, this&#xD; Court
    recognized that the Commandments “are undenia-&#xD; bly a sacred text in the Jewish and
    Christian faiths” and&#xD; held that their display in public classrooms violated the&#xD; First
    Amendment’s bar against establishment of religion.&#xD; Stone, 449 U. S., at 41. Stone found a
    predominantly reli-&#xD; gious purpose in the government’s posting of the Com-&#xD; mandments,
    given their prominence as “ ‘an instrument of&#xD; religion,’ ” id., at 41, n. 3 (quoting School
    Dist. of Abington&#xD; Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203, 224 (1963)). The&#xD; Counties ask
    for a different approach here by arguing that&#xD; official purpose is unknowable and the search
    for it inher-&#xD; ently vain. In the alternative, the Counties would avoid&#xD; the District
    Court’s conclusion by having us limit the scope&#xD; of the purpose enquiry so severely that any
    trivial ration-&#xD; alization would suffice, under a standard oblivious to the&#xD; history of
    religious government action like the progression&#xD; of exhibits in this case.&#xD; ——————&#xD;
    8 The Sixth Circuit did not decide whether the display had the im-&#xD; &#xD; permissible effect
    of advancing religion because one judge, having found&#xD; the display motivated by a religious
    purpose, did not reach that issue.&#xD; 354 F. 3d, at 462 (Gibbons, J., concurring). The other
    judge in the&#xD; majority concluded that a reasonable observer would find that the&#xD; display
    had the effect of endorsing religion given the lack of analytical&#xD; connection between the
    Commandments and the other documents in&#xD; the display, the courthouse location of the
    display, and the history of&#xD; the displays. Id., at 458–459. The dissent found no effect of
    endorse-&#xD; ment because it concluded that a reasonable observer would only see&#xD; that the
    County had merely acknowledged the foundational role of the&#xD; Ten Commandments rather than
    endorsed their religious content. Id.,&#xD; at 479–480.&#xD; Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)
    11&#xD; &#xD; Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; A&#xD; Ever since Lemon v. Kurtzman summarized the
    three&#xD; familiar considerations for evaluating Establishment&#xD; Clause claims, looking to
    whether government action has&#xD; “a secular legislative purpose” has been a common,
    albeit&#xD; seldom dispositive, element of our cases. 403 U. S., at 612.&#xD; Though we have
    found government action motivated by an&#xD; illegitimate purpose only four times since Lemon,9
    and&#xD; “the secular purpose requirement alone may rarely be&#xD; determinative . . . , it
    nevertheless serves an important&#xD; function.”10 Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 75
    (1985)&#xD; (O’CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment).&#xD; The touchstone for our analysis is the
    principle that the&#xD; “First Amendment mandates governmental neutrality&#xD; between religion
    and religion, and between religion and&#xD; nonreligion.” Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97,
    104&#xD; (1968); Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 15–16&#xD; (1947); Wallace v.
    Jaffree, supra, at 53. When the govern-&#xD; ment acts with the ostensible and predominant
    purpose of&#xD; advancing religion, it violates that central Establishment&#xD; Clause value of
    official religious neutrality, there being no&#xD; neutrality when the government’s ostensible
    object is to&#xD; take sides. Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of&#xD; Jesus Christ of
    Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327,&#xD; 335 (1987) (“Lemon’s ‘purpose’ requirement aims
    at pre-&#xD; venting [government] from abandoning neutrality and&#xD; ——————&#xD; 9 Stone v.

    (1985); Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S.&#xD; 578, 586–593 (1987); Santa Fe Independent School
    District v. Doe, 530&#xD; U. S., at 308–309.&#xD; 10 At least since Everson v. Board of Ed. of
    Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947), it&#xD; &#xD; has been clear that Establishment Clause doctrine lacks
    the comfort of&#xD; categorical absolutes. In special instances we have found good reason
    to&#xD; hold governmental action legitimate even where its manifest purpose was&#xD; presumably
    religious. See, e.g., Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983)&#xD; (upholding legislative prayer
    despite its religious nature). No such&#xD; reasons present themselves here.&#xD; 12 MCCREARY
    COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD; Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; acting
    with the intent of promoting a particular point of&#xD; view in religious matters”). Manifesting
    a purpose to&#xD; favor one faith over another, or adherence to religion&#xD; generally, clashes
    with the “understanding, reached . . .&#xD; after decades of religious war, that liberty and
    social&#xD; stability demand a religious tolerance that respects the&#xD; religious views of all
    citizens . . . .” Zelman v. Simmons-&#xD; Harris, 536 U. S. 639, 718 (2002) (BREYER, J.,
    dissenting).&#xD; By showing a purpose to favor religion, the government&#xD; “sends the . . .
    message to . . . nonadherents ‘that they are&#xD; outsiders, not full members of the political
    community,&#xD; and an accompanying message to adherents that they are&#xD; insiders, favored
    members. . . .’ ” Santa Fe Independent&#xD; School Dist. v. Doe, 530 U. S. 290, 309–310 (2000)
    (quoting&#xD; Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 688 (1984) (O’CON-&#xD; NOR, J.,
    concurring)).&#xD; Indeed, the purpose apparent from government action&#xD; can have an impact
    more significant than the result ex-&#xD; pressly decreed: when the government maintains
    Sunday&#xD; closing laws, it advances religion only minimally because&#xD; many working people
    would take the day as one of rest&#xD; regardless, but if the government justified its
    decision&#xD; with a stated desire for all Americans to honor Christ, the&#xD; divisive thrust
    of the official action would be inescapable.&#xD; This is the teaching of McGowan v. Maryland,
    366 U. S.&#xD; 420 (1961), which upheld Sunday closing statutes on&#xD; practical, secular
    grounds after finding that the govern-&#xD; ment had forsaken the religious purposes behind
    centu-&#xD; ries-old predecessor laws. Id., at 449–451.&#xD; B&#xD; Despite the intuitive
    importance of official purpose to&#xD; the realization of Establishment Clause values, the
    Coun-&#xD; ties ask us to abandon Lemon’s purpose test, or at least to&#xD; truncate any enquiry
    into purpose here. Their first ar-&#xD; gument is that the very consideration of purpose is
    decep-&#xD; Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005) 13&#xD; &#xD; Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; tive:
    according to them, true “purpose” is unknowable,&#xD; and its search merely an excuse for courts
    to act selec-&#xD; tively and unpredictably in picking out evidence of subjec-&#xD; tive intent.
    The assertions are as seismic as they are&#xD; unconvincing.&#xD; Examination of purpose is a
    staple of statutory interpre-&#xD; tation that makes up the daily fare of every appellate&#xD;
    court in the country, e.g., General Dynamics Land Sys-&#xD; tems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581,
    600 (2004) (interpreting&#xD; statute in light of its “text, structure, purpose, and his-&#xD;
    tory”), and governmental purpose is a key element of a&#xD; good deal of constitutional
    doctrine, e.g., Washington v.&#xD; Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976) (discriminatory purpose re-&#xD;
    quired for Equal Protection violation); Hunt v. Washington&#xD; State Apple Advertising Comm’n,
    432 U. S. 333, 352–353&#xD; (1977) (discriminatory purpose relevant to dormant Com-&#xD; merce
    Clause claim); Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.&#xD; v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520 (1993)
    (discriminatory purpose&#xD; raises level of scrutiny required by free exercise claim).&#xD;
    With enquiries into purpose this common, if they were&#xD; nothing but hunts for mares’ nests
    deflecting attention&#xD; from bare judicial will, the whole notion of purpose in law&#xD; would
    have dropped into disrepute long ago.&#xD; But scrutinizing purpose does make practical sense,
    as&#xD; in Establishment Clause analysis, where an understand-&#xD; ing of official objective
    emerges from readily discoverable&#xD; fact, without any judicial psychoanalysis of a
    drafter’s&#xD; heart of hearts. Wallace v. Jaffree, supra, at 74 (O’CON-&#xD; NOR, J.,
    concurring in judgment). The eyes that look to&#xD; purpose belong to an “ ‘objective observer,’
    ” one who takes&#xD; account of the traditional external signs that show up in&#xD; the “ ‘text,
    legislative history, and implementation of the&#xD; statute,’ ” or comparable official act.
    Santa Fe Independent&#xD; School Dist. v. Doe, supra, at 308 (quoting Wallace v.&#xD; Jaffree,
    472 U. S., at 73) (O’CONNOR, J., concurring in&#xD; judgment)); see also Edwards v. Aguillard,
    482 U. S. 578,&#xD; 14 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD;
    Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; 594–595 (1987) (enquiry looks to “plain meaning of the&#xD;
    statute’s words, enlightened by their context and the&#xD; contemporaneous legislative history
    [and] the historical&#xD; context of the statute, . . . and the specific sequence of&#xD; events
    leading to [its] passage”). There is, then, nothing&#xD; hinting at an unpredictable or
    disingenuous exercise when&#xD; a court enquires into purpose after a claim is raised under&#xD;
    the Establishment Clause.&#xD; The cases with findings of a predominantly religious&#xD; purpose
    point to the straightforward nature of the test. In&#xD; Wallace, for example, we inferred
    purpose from a change&#xD; of wording from an earlier statute to a later one, each&#xD; dealing
    with prayer in schools. 472 U. S., at 58–60. And&#xD; in Edwards, we relied on a statute’s text
    and the detailed&#xD; public comments of its sponsor, when we sought the pur-&#xD; pose of a
    state law requiring creationism to be taught&#xD; alongside evolution. 482 U. S., at 586–588. In
    other cases,&#xD; the government action itself bespoke the purpose, as in&#xD; Abington, where
    the object of required Bible study in&#xD; public schools was patently religious, 374 U. S., at
    223–&#xD; 224; in Stone, the Court held that the “[p]osting of reli-&#xD; gious texts on the
    wall serve[d] no . . . educational func-&#xD; tion,” and found that if “the posted copies of the
    Ten&#xD; Commandments [were] to have any effect at all, it [would]&#xD; be to induce the
    schoolchildren to read, meditate upon,&#xD; perhaps to venerate and obey, the Commandments.”
    449&#xD; U. S., at 42. In each case, the government’s action was&#xD; held unconstitutional only
    because openly available data&#xD; supported a commonsense conclusion that a religious&#xD;
    objective permeated the government’s action.&#xD; Nor is there any indication that the enquiry
    is rigged in&#xD; practice to finding a religious purpose dominant every&#xD; time a case is
    filed. In the past, the test has not been fatal&#xD; very often, presumably because government
    does not&#xD; generally act unconstitutionally, with the predominant&#xD; purpose of advancing
    religion. That said, one consequence&#xD; Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005) 15&#xD; &#xD; Opinion
    of the Court&#xD; &#xD; of the corollary that Establishment Clause analysis does&#xD; not look
    to the veiled psyche of government officers could&#xD; be that in some of the cases in which
    establishment com-&#xD; plaints failed, savvy officials had disguised their religious&#xD;
    intent so cleverly that the objective observer just missed&#xD; it. But that is no reason for
    great constitutional concern.&#xD; If someone in the government hides religious motive so&#xD;
    well that the “ ‘objective observer, acquainted with the&#xD; text, legislative history, and
    implementation of the stat-&#xD; ute,’ ” Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, 530 U.
    S.,&#xD; at 308 (quoting Wallace, supra, at 73) (O’CONNOR, J.,&#xD; concurring in judgment)),
    cannot see it, then without&#xD; something more the government does not make a divisive&#xD;
    announcement that in itself amounts to taking religious&#xD; sides. A secret motive stirs up no
    strife and does nothing&#xD; to make outsiders of nonadherents, and it suffices to wait&#xD; and
    see whether such government action turns out to have&#xD; (as it may even be likely to have) the
    illegitimate effect of&#xD; advancing religion.&#xD; C&#xD; After declining the invitation to
    abandon concern with&#xD; purpose wholesale, we also have to avoid the Counties’&#xD;
    alternative tack of trivializing the enquiry into it. The&#xD; Counties would read the cases as
    if the purpose enquiry&#xD; were so naive that any transparent claim to secularity&#xD; would
    satisfy it, and they would cut context out of the&#xD; enquiry, to the point of ignoring
    history, no matter what&#xD; bearing it actually had on the significance of current&#xD;
    circumstances. There is no precedent for the Counties’&#xD; arguments, or reason supporting
    them.&#xD; 1&#xD; Lemon said that government action must have “a secu-&#xD; lar . . . purpose,”
    403 U. S., at 612, and after a host of&#xD; cases it is fair to add that although a
    legislature’s stated&#xD; 16 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD;
    Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; reasons will generally get deference, the secular purpose&#xD;
    required has to be genuine, not a sham, and not merely&#xD; secondary to a religious objective.
    See, e.g., Santa Fe&#xD; Independent School Dist. v. Doe, supra, at 308 (“When a&#xD;
    governmental entity professes a secular purpose for an&#xD; arguably religious policy, the
    government’s characteriza-&#xD; tion is, of course, entitled to some deference. But it is&#xD;
    nonetheless the duty of the courts to ‘distinguis[h] a sham&#xD; secular purpose from a sincere
    one’ ”); Edwards, 482 U. S.,&#xD; at 586–587 (“While the Court is normally deferential to a&#xD;
    State’s articulation of a secular purpose, it is required&#xD; that the statement of such
    purpose be sincere and not a&#xD; sham”); id., at 590, 594 (referring to enquiry as one
    into&#xD; “preeminent” or “primary” purpose); Stone, supra, at 41&#xD; (looking to the
    “pre-eminent purpose” of government&#xD; action).&#xD; Even the Counties’ own cited authority
    confirms that we&#xD; have not made the purpose test a pushover for any secular&#xD; claim.
    True, Wallace said government action is tainted by&#xD; its object “if it is entirely motivated
    by a purpose to ad-&#xD; vance religion,” 472 U. S., at 56, a remark that suggests,&#xD; in
    isolation, a fairly complaisant attitude. But in that very&#xD; case the Court declined to
    credit Alabama’s stated secular&#xD; rationale of “accommodation” for legislation authorizing
    a&#xD; period of silence in school for meditation or voluntary&#xD; prayer, given the
    implausibility of that explanation in&#xD; light of another statute already accommodating
    children&#xD; wishing to pray. Id., at 57, n. 45 (internal quotation&#xD; marks omitted). And it
    would be just as much a mistake&#xD; to infer that a timid standard underlies the statement
    in&#xD; Lynch v. Donnelly that the purpose enquiry looks to&#xD; whether government “activity
    was motivated wholly by&#xD; religious considerations,” 465 U. S., at 680; for two cases&#xD;
    cited for that proposition had examined and rejected&#xD; claims of secular purposes that turned
    out to be implausi-&#xD; Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005) 17&#xD; &#xD; Opinion of the Court&#xD;

    also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S.&#xD; 589, 602 (1988) (using the “motivated wholly by an
    im-&#xD; permissible purpose” language, but citing Lynch and&#xD; Stone). As we said, the Court
    often does accept govern-&#xD; mental statements of purpose, in keeping with the respect&#xD;
    owed in the first instance to such official claims. But in&#xD; those unusual cases where the
    claim was an apparent&#xD; sham, or the secular purpose secondary, the unsurprising&#xD; results
    have been findings of no adequate secular object,&#xD; as against a predominantly religious
    one.13&#xD; 2&#xD; The Counties’ second proffered limitation can be dis-&#xD; patched quickly.
    They argue that purpose in a case like&#xD; &#xD; ——————&#xD; 11 Moreover, JUSTICE O’CONNOR
    provided the fifth vote for the Lynch&#xD; &#xD; majority and her concurrence emphasized the
    point made implicitly in&#xD; the majority opinion that a secular purpose must be serious to
    be&#xD; sufficient. 465 U. S., at 691 (The purpose inquiry “is not satisfied . . . by&#xD; the
    mere existence of some secular purpose, however dominated by&#xD; religious purposes”).&#xD; 12
    Stone found the sacred character of the Ten Commandments pre-&#xD; &#xD; eminent despite an
    avowed secular purpose to show their “adoption as&#xD; the fundamental legal code of Western
    Civilization and the Common&#xD; Law . . . .” 449 U. S., at 39–40, n. 1 (internal quotation
    marks omitted).&#xD; And the Abington Court was unconvinced that music education or the&#xD;
    teaching of literature were actual secular objects behind laws requiring&#xD; public school
    teachers to lead recitations from the Lord’s Prayer and&#xD; readings from the Bible. 374 U. S.,
    at 273.&#xD; 13 The dissent nonetheless maintains that the purpose test is satisfied&#xD; &#xD;
    so long as any secular purpose for the government action is apparent.&#xD; Post, at 18–19
    (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Leaving aside the fact that this&#xD; position is inconsistent with the
    language of the cases just discussed, it&#xD; would leave the purpose test with no real bite,
    given the ease of finding&#xD; some secular purpose for almost any government action. While
    height-&#xD; ened deference to legislatures is appropriate for the review of economic&#xD;
    legislation, an approach that credits any valid purpose, no matter how&#xD; trivial, has not
    been the way the Court has approached government&#xD; action that implicates establishment.&#xD;
    18 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD; Opinion of the Court&#xD;
    &#xD; this one should be inferred, if at all, only from the latest&#xD; news about the last in a
    series of governmental actions,&#xD; however close they may all be in time and subject. But
    the&#xD; world is not made brand new every morning, and the&#xD; Counties are simply asking us
    to ignore perfectly proba-&#xD; tive evidence; they want an absentminded objective ob-&#xD;
    server, not one presumed to be familiar with the history of&#xD; the government’s actions and
    competent to learn what&#xD; history has to show, Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v.&#xD; Doe,
    530 U. S., at 308 (objective observer is familiar with&#xD; “ ‘implementation of’ ” government
    action) (quoting Wal-&#xD; lace, supra, at 73) (O’CONNOR, J., concurring in judg-&#xD; ment));
    Edwards, supra, at 595 (enquiry looks to “the&#xD; historical context of the statute . . . and
    the specific se-&#xD; quence of events leading to [its] passage”); Capitol Square&#xD; Review
    and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 780&#xD; (1995) (O’CONNOR, J., concurring in part
    and concurring in&#xD; judgment) (“[T]he reasonable observer in the endorsement&#xD; inquiry
    must be deemed aware of the history and context&#xD; of the community and forum in which the
    religious display&#xD; appears”). The Counties’ position just bucks common&#xD; sense:
    reasonable observers have reasonable memories,&#xD; and our precedents sensibly forbid an
    observer “to turn a&#xD; blind eye to the context in which [the] policy arose.”14&#xD;
    ——————&#xD; 14 One consequence of taking account of the purpose underlying past&#xD; &#xD;
    actions is that the same government action may be constitutional if&#xD; taken in the first
    instance and unconstitutional if it has a sectarian&#xD; heritage. This presents no incongruity,
    however, because purpose&#xD; matters. Just as Holmes’s dog could tell the difference between
    being&#xD; kicked and being stumbled over, it will matter to objective observers&#xD; whether
    posting the Commandments follows on the heels of displays&#xD; motivated by sectarianism, or
    whether it lacks a history demonstrating&#xD; that purpose. The dissent, apparently not giving
    the reasonable&#xD; observer as much credit as Holmes’s dog, contends that in practice it&#xD;
    will be “absur[d]” to rely upon differences in purpose in assessing&#xD; government action.
    Post, at 24. As an initial matter, it will be the rare&#xD; case in which one of two identical
    displays violates the purpose prong.&#xD; Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005) 19&#xD; &#xD; Opinion
    of the Court&#xD; &#xD; Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, supra, at 315.&#xD; III&#xD;
    This case comes to us on appeal from a preliminary&#xD; injunction. We accordingly review the
    District Court’s&#xD; legal rulings de novo, and its ultimate conclusion for abuse&#xD; of
    discretion.15 Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union,&#xD; 542 U. S. 656 (2004).&#xD; We
    take Stone as the initial legal benchmark, our only&#xD; case dealing with the constitutionality
    of displaying the&#xD; Commandments. Stone recognized that the Command-&#xD; ments are an
    “instrument of religion” and that, at least on&#xD; the facts before it, the display of their
    text could presump-&#xD; tively be understood as meant to advance religion: al-&#xD; though
    state law specifically required their posting in&#xD; public school classrooms, their isolated
    exhibition did not&#xD; leave room even for an argument that secular education&#xD; explained
    their being there. 449 U. S., at 41, n. 3 (internal&#xD; quotation marks omitted). But Stone did
    not purport to&#xD; decide the constitutionality of every possible way the&#xD; Commandments
    might be set out by the government, and&#xD; under the Establishment Clause detail is key.
    County of&#xD; Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater&#xD; Pittsburgh Chapter, 492
    U. S. 573, 595 (1989) (opinion of&#xD; &#xD; ——————&#xD; In general, like displays tend to show
    like objectives and will be treated&#xD; accordingly. But where one display has a history
    manifesting sectarian&#xD; purpose that the other lacks, it is appropriate that they be
    treated&#xD; differently, for the one display will be properly understood as demon-&#xD;
    strating a preference for one group of religious believers as against&#xD; another. See supra,
    at 11–12. While posting the Commandments may&#xD; not have the effect of causing greater
    adherence to them, an ostensible&#xD; indication of a purpose to promote a particular faith
    certainly will have&#xD; the effect of causing viewers to understand the government is
    taking&#xD; sides.&#xD; 15 We note that the only factor in the preliminary injunction
    analysis&#xD; &#xD; that is at issue here is the likelihood of the ACLU’s success on the&#xD;
    merits.&#xD; 20 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD; Opinion of
    the Court&#xD; &#xD; Blackmun, J.) (“[T]he question is what viewers may fairly&#xD; understand
    to be the purpose of the display. That inquiry,&#xD; of necessity, turns upon the context in
    which the contested&#xD; object appears”) (internal quotation marks and citation&#xD; omitted).
    Hence, we look to the record of evidence showing&#xD; the progression leading up to the third
    display of the&#xD; Commandments.&#xD; A&#xD; The display rejected in Stone had two obvious
    similari-&#xD; ties to the first one in the sequence here: both set out a&#xD; text of the
    Commandments as distinct from any tradition-&#xD; ally symbolic representation, and each stood
    alone, not&#xD; part of an arguably secular display. Stone stressed the&#xD; significance of
    integrating the Commandments into a&#xD; secular scheme to forestall the broadcast of an
    otherwise&#xD; clearly religious message, supra, at 42, and for good rea-&#xD; son, the
    Commandments being a central point of reference&#xD; in the religious and moral history of Jews
    and Christians.&#xD; They proclaim the existence of a monotheistic god (no&#xD; other gods).
    They regulate details of religious obligation&#xD; (no graven images, no sabbath breaking, no
    vain oath&#xD; swearing). And they unmistakably rest even the univer-&#xD; sally accepted
    prohibitions (as against murder, theft, and&#xD; the like) on the sanction of the divinity
    proclaimed at the&#xD; beginning of the text. Displaying that text is thus differ-&#xD; ent from
    a symbolic depiction, like tablets with 10 roman&#xD; numerals, which could be seen as alluding
    to a general&#xD; notion of law, not a sectarian conception of faith. Where&#xD; the text is set
    out, the insistence of the religious message&#xD; is hard to avoid in the absence of a context
    plausibly sug-&#xD; gesting a message going beyond an excuse to promote the&#xD; religious point
    of view. The display in Stone had no con-&#xD; text that might have indicated an object beyond
    the reli-&#xD; gious character of the text, and the Counties’ solo exhibit&#xD; here did nothing
    more to counter the sectarian implication&#xD; Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005) 21&#xD; &#xD;
    Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; than the postings at issue in Stone.16 See also County of&#xD;
    Allegheny, supra, at 598 (“Here, unlike in Lynch [v. Don-&#xD; nelly], nothing in the context of
    the display detracts from the&#xD; crèche’s religious message”). Actually, the posting by
    the&#xD; Counties lacked even the Stone display’s implausible&#xD; disclaimer that the
    Commandments were set out to show&#xD; their effect on the civil law.17 What is more, at the
    cere-&#xD; mony for posting the framed Commandments in Pulaski&#xD; County, the county executive
    was accompanied by his&#xD; pastor, who testified to the certainty of the existence of&#xD; God.
    The reasonable observer could only think that the&#xD; Counties meant to emphasize and celebrate
    the Com-&#xD; mandments’ religious message.&#xD; This is not to deny that the Commandments have
    had&#xD; influence on civil or secular law; a major text of a majority&#xD; religion is bound to
    be felt. The point is simply that the&#xD; original text viewed in its entirety is an
    unmistakably&#xD; religious statement dealing with religious obligations and&#xD; with morality
    subject to religious sanction. When the&#xD; government initiates an effort to place this
    statement&#xD; alone in public view, a religious object is unmistakable.&#xD; B&#xD; Once the
    Counties were sued, they modified the exhibits&#xD; and invited additional insight into their
    purpose in a&#xD; display that hung for about six months. This new one was&#xD; the product of
    forthright and nearly identical Pulaski and&#xD; McCreary County resolutions listing a series of
    American&#xD; ——————&#xD; 16 Although the Counties point out that the courthouses contained&#xD;
    &#xD; other displays besides the Ten Commandments, there is no suggestion&#xD; that the
    Commandments display was integrated to form a secular&#xD; display.&#xD; 17 In Stone, the
    Commandments were accompanied by a small dis-&#xD; &#xD; claimer: “The secular application of
    the Ten Commandments is clearly&#xD; seen in its adoption as the fundamental legal code of
    Western Civiliza-&#xD; tion and the Common Law of the United States.” 449 U. S., at 39–40,&#xD;

    LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD; Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; historical documents with
    theistic and Christian refer-&#xD; ences, which were to be posted in order to furnish a
    setting&#xD; for displaying the Ten Commandments and any “other&#xD; Kentucky and American
    historical documen[t]” without&#xD; raising concern about “any Christian or religious
    refer-&#xD; ences” in them. Def. Exh. 1, at 1. As mentioned, the&#xD; resolutions expressed
    support for an Alabama judge who&#xD; posted the Commandments in his courtroom, and cited
    the&#xD; fact the Kentucky Legislature once adjourned a session in&#xD; honor of “Jesus Christ,
    Prince of Ethics.” Id., at 2–3.&#xD; In this second display, unlike the first, the Command-&#xD;
    ments were not hung in isolation, merely leaving the&#xD; Counties’ purpose to emerge from the
    pervasively religious&#xD; text of the Commandments themselves. Instead, the&#xD; second version
    was required to include the statement of&#xD; the government’s purpose expressly set out in the
    county&#xD; resolutions, and underscored it by juxtaposing the Com-&#xD; mandments to other
    documents with highlighted refer-&#xD; ences to God as their sole common element. The
    display’s&#xD; unstinting focus was on religious passages, showing that&#xD; the Counties were
    posting the Commandments precisely&#xD; because of their sectarian content. That demonstration
    of&#xD; the government’s objective was enhanced by serial reli-&#xD; gious references and the
    accompanying resolution’s claim&#xD; about the embodiment of ethics in Christ. Together,
    the&#xD; display and resolution presented an indisputable, and&#xD; undisputed, showing of an
    impermissible purpose.&#xD; Today, the Counties make no attempt to defend their&#xD; undeniable
    objective, but instead hopefully describe ver-&#xD; sion two as “dead and buried.” Reply Brief
    for Petitioners&#xD; 15. Their refusal to defend the second display is under-&#xD; standable,
    but the reasonable observer could not forget it.&#xD; C&#xD; 1&#xD; After the Counties changed
    lawyers, they mounted a&#xD; Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005) 23&#xD; &#xD; Opinion of the
    Court&#xD; &#xD; third display, without a new resolution or repeal of the old&#xD; one. The
    result was the “Foundations of American Law&#xD; and Government” exhibit, which placed the
    Command-&#xD; ments in the company of other documents the Counties&#xD; thought especially
    significant in the historical foundation&#xD; of American government. In trying to persuade the
    District&#xD; Court to lift the preliminary injunction, the Counties cited&#xD; several new
    purposes for the third version, including a&#xD; desire “to educate the citizens of the county
    regarding&#xD; some of the documents that played a significant role in the&#xD; foundation of
    our system of law and government.”18 145&#xD; F. Supp. 2d, at 848 (internal quotation marks
    omitted). The&#xD; Counties’ claims did not, however, persuade the court,&#xD; intimately
    familiar with the details of this litigation, or&#xD; the Court of Appeals, neither of which
    found a legitimizing&#xD; secular purpose in this third version of the display.&#xD; “ ‘When
    both courts [that have already passed on the case]&#xD; are unable to discern an arguably valid
    secular purpose,&#xD; this Court normally should hesitate to find one.’ ” Ed-&#xD; wards, 482 U.
    S., at 594, n. 15 (quoting Wallace, 472 U. S.,&#xD; at 66 (Powell, J., concurring)). The
    conclusions of the two&#xD; courts preceding us in this case are well warranted.&#xD; These new
    statements of purpose were presented only&#xD; as a litigating position, there being no further
    authorizing&#xD; action by the Counties’ governing boards. And although&#xD; repeal of the
    earlier county authorizations would not have&#xD; erased them from the record of evidence
    bearing on cur-&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; ——————&#xD; 18 The Counties’ other purposes were:&#xD; “to

    demonstrate that the Ten Commandments were part of&#xD; the foundation of American Law and
    Government; . . . [to include the&#xD; Ten Commandments] as part of the display for their
    significance in&#xD; providing ‘the moral background of the Declaration of Independence&#xD; and
    the foundation of our legal tradition.’ ” 145 F. Supp. 2d, at 848&#xD; (some internal quotation
    marks omitted).&#xD; 24 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD;
    Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; rent purpose,19 the extraordinary resolutions for the sec-&#xD;
    ond display passed just months earlier were not repealed&#xD; or otherwise repudiated.20 Indeed,
    the sectarian spirit of&#xD; the common resolution found enhanced expression in the&#xD; third
    display, which quoted more of the purely religious&#xD; language of the Commandments than the
    first two dis-&#xD; plays had done; for additions, see App. to Pet. for Cert.&#xD; 189a (“I the
    LORD thy God am a jealous God”) (text of&#xD; Second Commandment in third display); (“the LORD
    will&#xD; not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain”) (from&#xD; text of Third
    Commandment); and (“that thy days may be&#xD; long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth
    thee”)&#xD; (text of Fifth Commandment). No reasonable observer&#xD; could swallow the claim
    that the Counties had cast off the&#xD; objective so unmistakable in the earlier displays.&#xD;
    Nor did the selection of posted material suggest a clear&#xD; theme that might prevail over
    evidence of the continuing&#xD; religious object. In a collection of documents said to be&#xD;
    “foundational” to American government, it is at least odd&#xD; to include a patriotic anthem,
    but to omit the Fourteenth&#xD; Amendment, the most significant structural provision&#xD;
    ——————&#xD; 19 Following argument in this case, in which the resolutions were&#xD; &#xD;
    discussed, the McCreary and Pulaski County Boards did repeal the&#xD; resolutions, acts of
    obviously minimal significance in the evolution of&#xD; the evidence.&#xD; 20 The Counties argue
    that the objective observer would not continue&#xD; &#xD; to believe that the resolution was in
    effect after the third display went&#xD; up because the resolution authorized only the second
    display. But the&#xD; resolution on its face is not limited to any particular display. On
    the&#xD; contrary, it encourages the creation of a display with the Ten Com-&#xD; mandments that
    also includes such documents as “the National anthem&#xD; . . . the National Motto . . . the
    preamble to the Kentucky Constitu-&#xD; tion[,] the Declaration of Independence [and] the
    Mayflower Compact&#xD; . . . without censorship because of any Christian or religious
    refer-&#xD; ences.” Def. Exh. 1, at 1. The third display contains all of these docu-&#xD; ments,
    suggesting that it fell within the resolutions as well. The record&#xD; does not indicate
    whether the resolutions were posted with the third&#xD; display.&#xD; Cite as: 545 U. S. ____

    from the&#xD; Thames.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 205a, ¶33. If an observer&#xD; found these choices
    and omissions perplexing in isolation,&#xD; he would be puzzled for a different reason when he
    read&#xD; the Declaration of Independence seeking confirmation for&#xD; the Counties’ posted
    explanation that the “Ten Com-&#xD; mandments’ . . . influence is clearly seen in the
    Declara-&#xD; tion,” id., at 180a; in fact the observer would find that the&#xD; Commandments
    are sanctioned as divine imperatives,&#xD; while the Declaration of Independence holds that
    the&#xD; authority of government to enforce the law derives “from&#xD; the consent of the
    governed,” id., at 190a.21 If the observer&#xD; had not thrown up his hands, he would probably
    suspect&#xD; that the Counties were simply reaching for any way to&#xD; keep a religious
    document on the walls of courthouses&#xD; constitutionally required to embody religious
    neutrality.22&#xD; ——————&#xD; 21 The Counties have now backed away from their broad
    assertion&#xD; &#xD; that the Commandments provide “the” moral background of the Decla-&#xD;
    ration of Independence, and now merely claim that many of the Com-&#xD; mandments “regarding

    7.&#xD; 22 The Counties grasp at McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420 (1961),&#xD; &#xD; but it
    bears little resemblance to this case. As noted supra, at 12–13,&#xD; McGowan held that
    religious purposes behind centuries-old predeces-&#xD; sors of Maryland’s Sunday laws were not
    dispositive of the purposes of&#xD; modern Sunday laws, where the legislature had removed much
    of the&#xD; religious reference in the laws and stated secular and pragmatic&#xD; justifications
    for them. 366 U. S., at 446–452. But a conclusion that&#xD; centuries-old purposes may no longer
    be operative says nothing about&#xD; the relevance of recent evidence of purpose, and this case
    is far more&#xD; like Santa Fe, with its evolution of a school football game prayer policy&#xD;
    over the course of a single lawsuit. Like that case, “[t]his [one] comes to&#xD; us as the
    latest step in developing litigation brought as a challenge to&#xD; institutional practices that
    unquestionably violated the Establishment&#xD; 26 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL
    LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD; Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; 2&#xD; In holding the
    preliminary injunction adequately sup-&#xD; ported by evidence that the Counties’ purpose had
    not&#xD; changed at the third stage, we do not decide that the&#xD; Counties’ past actions
    forever taint any effort on their part&#xD; to deal with the subject matter. We hold only that
    pur-&#xD; pose needs to be taken seriously under the Establishment&#xD; Clause and needs to be
    understood in light of context; an&#xD; implausible claim that governmental purpose has
    changed&#xD; should not carry the day in a court of law any more than&#xD; in a head with common
    sense. It is enough to say here&#xD; that district courts are fully capable of adjusting
    prelimi-&#xD; nary relief to take account of genuine changes in constitu-&#xD; tionally
    significant conditions. See Ashcroft v. American&#xD; Civil Liberties Union, 542 U. S. 656
    (2004).&#xD; Nor do we have occasion here to hold that a sacred text&#xD; can never be
    integrated constitutionally into a governmen-&#xD; tal display on the subject of law, or
    American history. We&#xD; do not forget, and in this litigation have frequently been&#xD;
    reminded, that our own courtroom frieze was deliberately&#xD; designed in the exercise of
    governmental authority so as to&#xD; include the figure of Moses holding tablets exhibiting
    a&#xD; portion of the Hebrew text of the later, secularly phrased&#xD; Commandments; in the
    company of 17 other lawgivers,&#xD; most of them secular figures, there is no risk that
    Moses&#xD; would strike an observer as evidence that the National&#xD; Government was violating
    neutrality in religion.23&#xD; &#xD; ——————&#xD; Clause.” 530 U. S., at 315. (describing the
    evolution of the school&#xD; district’s football prayer policy). Thus, as in Santa Fe, it makes
    sense&#xD; to examine the Counties’ latest action “in light of [their] history of”&#xD;
    unconstitutional practices. Id., at 309.&#xD; 23 The dissent notes that another depiction of
    Moses and the Com-&#xD; &#xD; mandments adorns this Court’s east pediment. Post, at 23. But
    as&#xD; with the courtroom frieze, Moses is found in the company of other&#xD; figures, not only
    great but secular.&#xD; Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005) 27&#xD; &#xD; Opinion of the Court&#xD;
    &#xD; IV&#xD; The importance of neutrality as an interpretive guide is&#xD; no less true now
    than it was when the Court broached the&#xD; principle in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330
    U. S. 1&#xD; (1947), and a word needs to be said about the different&#xD; view taken in today’s
    dissent. We all agree, of course, on&#xD; the need for some interpretative help. The First
    Amend-&#xD; ment contains no textual definition of “establishment,”&#xD; and the term is
    certainly not self-defining. No one con-&#xD; tends that the prohibition of establishment stops
    at a&#xD; designation of a national (or with Fourteenth Amendment&#xD; incorporation, Cantwell
    v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 303&#xD; (1940), a state) church, but nothing in the text says
    just&#xD; how much more it covers. There is no simple answer, for&#xD; more than one
    reason.&#xD; The prohibition on establishment covers a variety of&#xD; issues from prayer in
    widely varying government settings,&#xD; to financial aid for religious individuals and
    institutions,&#xD; to comment on religious questions. In these varied set-&#xD; tings, issues of
    about interpreting inexact Establishment&#xD; Clause language, like difficult interpretative
    issues gener-&#xD; ally, arise from the tension of competing values, each&#xD; constitutionally
    respectable, but none open to realization&#xD; to the logical limit.&#xD; The First Amendment
    has not one but two clauses tied&#xD; to “religion,” the second forbidding any prohibition on
    the&#xD; “the free exercise thereof,” and sometimes, the two clauses&#xD; compete: spending
    government money on the clergy looks&#xD; like establishing religion, but if the government
    cannot&#xD; pay for military chaplains a good many soldiers and sail-&#xD; ors would be kept
    from the opportunity to exercise their&#xD; chosen religions. See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S.
    ___,&#xD; ___ (2005) (slip. op., at 8–9). At other times, limits on&#xD; governmental action
    that might make sense as a way to&#xD; avoid establishment could arguably limit freedom of&#xD;
    speech when the speaking is done under government&#xD; 28 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL
    LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD; Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; auspices. Rosenberger v. Rector
    and Visitors of Univ. of&#xD; Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995). The dissent, then, is wrong to&#xD;
    read cases like Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York,&#xD; 397 U. S. 664 (1970), as a
    rejection of neutrality on its own&#xD; terms, post, at 7–8, for trade-offs are inevitable, and
    an&#xD; elegant interpretative rule to draw the line in all the&#xD; multifarious situations is
    not be had.&#xD; Given the variety of interpretative problems, the princi-&#xD; ple of
    neutrality has provided a good sense of direction: the&#xD; government may not favor one
    religion over another, or&#xD; religion over irreligion, religious choice being the
    preroga-&#xD; tive of individuals under the Free Exercise Clause. The&#xD; principle has been
    helpful simply because it responds to&#xD; one of the major concerns that prompted adoption of
    the&#xD; Religion Clauses. The Framers and the citizens of their&#xD; time intended not only to
    protect the integrity of individ-&#xD; ual conscience in religious matters, Wallace v. Jaffree,
    472&#xD; U. S., at 52–54, and n. 38, but to guard against the civic&#xD; divisiveness that
    follows when the Government weighs in&#xD; on one side of religious debate; nothing does a
    better job of&#xD; roiling society, a point that needed no explanation to the&#xD; descendants
    of English Puritans and Cavaliers (or Massa-&#xD; chusetts Puritans and Baptists). E.g.,
    Everson, supra, at 8&#xD; (“A large proportion of the early settlers of this country&#xD; came
    here from Europe to escape [religious persecution]”).&#xD; A sense of the past thus points to
    governmental neutrality&#xD; as an objective of the Establishment Clause, and a sensi-&#xD; ble
    standard for applying it. To be sure, given its general-&#xD; ity as a principle, an appeal to
    neutrality alone cannot&#xD; possibly lay every issue to rest, or tell us what issues on&#xD;
    the margins are substantial enough for constitutional&#xD; significance, a point that has been
    clear from the Found-&#xD; ing era to modern times. E.g., Letter from J. Madison to&#xD; R.
    Adams (1832), in 5 The Founders’ Constitution at 107&#xD; (P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987)
    (“[In calling for separa-&#xD; tion] I must admit moreover that it may not be easy, in&#xD; Cite
    as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005) 29&#xD; &#xD; Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; every possible case, to
    trace the line of separation between&#xD; the rights of religion and the Civil authority with
    such&#xD; distinctness as to avoid collisions &amp; doubts on unessential&#xD; points”);
    Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, 422 (1963)&#xD; (Harlan, J., dissenting) (“The constitutional
    obligation of&#xD; ‘neutrality’ . . . is not so narrow a channel that the slightest&#xD;
    deviation from an absolutely straight course leads to con-&#xD; demnation”). But invoking
    neutrality is a prudent way of&#xD; keeping sight of something the Framers of the First&#xD;
    Amendment thought important.&#xD; The dissent, however, puts forward a limitation on the&#xD;
    application of the neutrality principle, with citations to&#xD; historical evidence said to show
    that the Framers under-&#xD; stood the ban on establishment of religion as sufficiently&#xD;
    narrow to allow the government to espouse submission to&#xD; the divine will. The dissent
    identifies God as the God of&#xD; monotheism, all of whose three principal strains (Jewish,&#xD;
    Christian, and Muslim) acknowledge the religious impor-&#xD; tance of the Ten Commandments.
    Post, at 9–10. On the&#xD; dissent’s view, it apparently follows that even rigorous&#xD;
    espousal of a common element of this common monothe-&#xD; ism, is consistent with the
    establishment ban.&#xD; But the dissent’s argument for the original understand-&#xD; ing is
    flawed from the outset by its failure to consider the&#xD; full range of evidence showing what
    the Framers believed.&#xD; The dissent is certainly correct in putting forward evi-&#xD; dence
    that some of the Framers thought some endorse-&#xD; ment of religion was compatible with the
    establishment&#xD; ban; the dissent quotes the first President as stating that&#xD; “national
    morality [cannot] prevail in exclusion of religious&#xD; principle,” for example, post, at 3,
    and it cites his first&#xD; Thanksgiving proclamation giving thanks to God, post, at&#xD; 2
    (internal quotation marks omitted). Surely if expres-&#xD; sions like these from Washington and
    his contemporaries&#xD; were all we had to go on, there would be a good case that&#xD; the
    neutrality principle has the effect of broadening the&#xD; 30 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL
    LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD; Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; ban on establishment beyond the
    Framers’ understand-&#xD; ing of it (although there would, of course, still be the&#xD; question
    of whether the historical case could overcome&#xD; some 60 years of precedent taking neutrality
    as its guid-&#xD; ing principle).24&#xD; But the fact is that we do have more to go on, for
    there&#xD; is also evidence supporting the proposition that the Fram-&#xD; ers intended the
    Establishment Clause to require govern-&#xD; mental neutrality in matters of religion, including
    neutral-&#xD; ity in statements acknowledging religion. The very&#xD; language of the
    Establishment Clause represented a&#xD; significant departure from early drafts that merely
    prohib-&#xD; ited a single national religion, and, the final language&#xD; instead “extended
    [the] prohibition to state support for&#xD; ‘religion’ in general.” See Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.
    S. 577,&#xD; 614–615 (1992) (SOUTER, J., concurring) (tracing develop-&#xD; ment of
    language).&#xD; The historical record, moreover, is complicated beyond&#xD; the dissent’s
    account by the writings and practices of&#xD; figures no less influential than Thomas Jefferson
    and&#xD; James Madison. Jefferson, for example, refused to issue&#xD; Thanksgiving Proclamations
    because he believed that they&#xD; violated the Constitution. See Letter to S. Miller (Jan.
    23,&#xD; 1808), in 5 The Founders’ Constitution at 98. And Madi-&#xD; son, whom the dissent
    claims as supporting its thesis,&#xD; ——————&#xD; 24 The dissent also maintains that our
    precedents show that a solo&#xD; &#xD; display of the Commandments is a mere acknowledgement of
    religion&#xD; “on par with the inclusion of a crèche or a menorah” in a holiday&#xD; display, or
    an official’s speech or prayer, post, at 22. Whether or not our&#xD; views would differ about
    the significance of those practices if we were&#xD; considering them as original matters, they
    manifest no objective of&#xD; subjecting individual lives to religious influence comparable to
    the&#xD; apparent and openly acknowledged purpose behind posting the Com-&#xD; mandments.
    Crèches placed with holiday symbols and prayers by&#xD; legislators do not insistently call for
    religious action on the part of&#xD; citizens; the history of posting the Commandments expressed
    a purpose&#xD; to urge citizens to act in prescribed ways as a personal response to&#xD; divine
    authority.&#xD; Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005) 31&#xD; &#xD; Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD;

    persecution. It&#xD; degrades from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose&#xD; opinions in
    Religion do not bend to those of the Legislative&#xD; authority.” 505 U. S., at 622 (internal
    quotation marks&#xD; omitted); see also Letter from J. Madison to E. Livingston&#xD; (July 10,
    1822), in 5 The Founders’ Constitution, at 106&#xD; (“[R]eligion &amp; Govt. will both exist in
    greater purity, the&#xD; less they are mixed together”); Letter from J. Madison to&#xD; J. Adams
    (Sept. 1833) in Religion and Politics in the Early&#xD; Republic 120 (D. Dresibach ed. 1996)
    (stating that with&#xD; respect to religion and government the “tendency to a&#xD; usurpation on
    one side, or the other, or to a corrupting&#xD; coalition or alliance between them, will be best

    Orden v. Perry, 545 U. S. ___ (2005)&#xD; (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 19-20).25&#xD;
    The fair inference is that there was no common under-&#xD; standing about the limits of the
    establishment prohibition,&#xD; and the dissent’s conclusion that its narrower view was&#xD; the
    original understanding, post, at 2–3, stretches the&#xD; evidence beyond tensile capacity. What
    the evidence does&#xD; show is a group of statesmen, like others before and after&#xD; them, who
    proposed a guarantee with contours not wholly&#xD; worked out, leaving the Establishment Clause
    with edges&#xD; still to be determined. And none the worse for that. Inde-&#xD; terminate edges

    that separationists like Jef-&#xD; &#xD; ferson and Madison were not absolutely consistent in
    abstaining from&#xD; official religious acknowledgment. Post, at 4. But, a record of
    inconsis-&#xD; tent historical practice is too weak a lever to upset decades of precedent&#xD;
    adhering to the neutrality principle. And it is worth noting that Jeffer-&#xD; son thought his
    actions were consistent with non-endorsement of&#xD; religion and Madison regretted any
    backsliding he may have done. Lee&#xD; v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 622–25 (1992) (SOUTER, J.,
    concurring).&#xD; “Homer nodded.” Id., at 624, n. 5 (corrected in erratum at 535 U. S., at

    Court&#xD; &#xD; meant to endure, and to meet “exigencies which, if fore-&#xD; seen at all, must
    have been seen dimly, and which can be&#xD; best provided for as they occur.” McCulloch v.
    Maryland,&#xD; 4 Wheat. 316, 415 (1819).&#xD; While the dissent fails to show a consistent
    original&#xD; understanding from which to argue that the neutrality&#xD; principle should be
    rejected, it does manage to deliver a&#xD; surprise. As mentioned, the dissent says that the
    deity&#xD; the Framers had in mind was the God of monotheism,&#xD; with the consequence that
    government may espouse a&#xD; tenet of traditional monotheism. This is truly a remark-&#xD; able
    view. Other members of the Court have dissented on&#xD; the ground that the Establishment Clause
    bars nothing&#xD; more than governmental preference for one religion over&#xD; another, e.g.,
    Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S., at 98–99&#xD; (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting), but at least religion
    has&#xD; previously been treated inclusively. Today’s dissent,&#xD; however, apparently means
    that government should be&#xD; free to approve the core beliefs of a favored religion over&#xD;
    the tenets of others, a view that should trouble anyone&#xD; who prizes religious liberty.
    Certainly history cannot&#xD; justify it; on the contrary, history shows that the religion&#xD;
    of concern to the Framers was not that of the monotheistic&#xD; faiths generally, but
    Christianity in particular, a fact that&#xD; no member of this Court takes as a premise for
    construing&#xD; the Religion Clauses. Justice Story probably reflected the&#xD; thinking of the
    framing generation when he wrote in his&#xD; Commentaries that the purpose of the Clause was
    “not to&#xD; countenance, much less to advance, Mahometanism, or&#xD; Judaism, or infidelity, by
    prostrating Christianity; but to&#xD; exclude all rivalry among Christian sects.” R. Cord,
    Sepa-&#xD; ration of Church and State: Historical Fact and Current&#xD; Fiction 13 (1988)
    (emphasis omitted). The Framers would,&#xD; therefore, almost certainly object to the dissent’s
    unstated&#xD; reasoning that because Christianity was a monotheistic&#xD; “religion,” monotheism
    with Mosaic antecedents should be&#xD; Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005) 33&#xD; &#xD; Opinion of
    the Court&#xD; &#xD; a touchstone of establishment interpretation.26 Even on&#xD; originalist
    critiques of existing precedent there is, it&#xD; seems, no escape from interpretative
    consequences that&#xD; would surprise the Framers. Thus, it appears to be com-&#xD; mon ground
    in the interpretation of a Constitution “in-&#xD; tended to endure for ages to come,” McCulloch
    v. Mary-&#xD; land, supra, at 415, that applications unanticipated by the&#xD; Framers are
    inevitable.&#xD; Historical evidence thus supports no solid argument for&#xD; changing course
    (whatever force the argument might have&#xD; when directed at the existing precedent), whereas
    public&#xD; discourse at the present time certainly raises no doubt&#xD; about the value of the
    interpretative approach invoked for&#xD; 60 years now. We are centuries away from the St.
    Bar-&#xD; tholomew’s Day massacre and the treatment of heretics in&#xD; early Massachusetts, but
    the divisiveness of religion in&#xD; current public life is inescapable. This is no time to
    deny&#xD; the prudence of understanding the Establishment&#xD; Clause to require the Government
    to stay neutral on&#xD; religious belief, which is reserved for the conscience of&#xD; the
    individual.&#xD; V&#xD; Given the ample support for the District Court’s finding&#xD; &#xD;
    ——————&#xD; 26 There might, indeed, even have been some reservations about&#xD; &#xD; monotheism
    as the paradigm example. It is worth noting that the&#xD; canonical biography of George
    Washington, the dissent’s primary&#xD; exemplar of the monotheistic tradition, calls him a
    deist. J. Flexner,&#xD; George Washington: Anguish and Farewell (1793–1799) 490 (1972)&#xD;
    (“Washington’s religious belief was that of the enlightenment: deism”).&#xD; It would have been
    odd for the First Congress to propose an Amend-&#xD; ment with Religion Clauses that took no
    account of the President’s&#xD; religion. As with other historical matters pertinent here,
    however,&#xD; there are conflicting conclusions. R. Brookhiser, Founding Father:&#xD;
    Rediscovering George Washington 146 (1996) (“Washington’s God was&#xD; no watchmaker”). History

    2005]&#xD; &#xD; JUSTICE O’CONNOR, concurring.&#xD; I join in the Court’s opinion. The First
    Amendment&#xD; expresses our Nation’s fundamental commitment to reli-&#xD; gious liberty by
    means of two provisions—one protecting&#xD; the free exercise of religion, the other barring
    establish-&#xD; ment of religion. They were written by the descendents of&#xD; people who had
    come to this land precisely so that they&#xD; could practice their religion freely. Together
    with the&#xD; other First Amendment guarantees—of free speech, a free&#xD; press, and the rights
    to assemble and petition—the Relig-&#xD; ion Clauses were designed to safeguard the freedom
    of&#xD; conscience and belief that those immigrants had sought.&#xD; They embody an idea that
    was once considered radical:&#xD; Free people are entitled to free and diverse thoughts,&#xD;
    which government ought neither to constrain nor to direct.&#xD; Reasonable minds can disagree
    about how to apply the&#xD; Religion Clauses in a given case. But the goal of the&#xD; Clauses
    is clear: to carry out the Founders’ plan of pre-&#xD; serving religious liberty to the fullest
    extent possible in a&#xD; pluralistic society. By enforcing the Clauses, we have kept&#xD;
    religion a matter for the individual conscience, not for the&#xD; prosecutor or bureaucrat. At a

    themselves fortunate: Our regard for constitutional&#xD; boundaries has protected us from
    similar travails, while&#xD; allowing private religious exercise to flourish. The well-&#xD;
    known statement that “[w]e are a religious people,” Zorach&#xD; v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306, 313
    (1952), has proved true.&#xD; Americans attend their places of worship more often than&#xD; do
    citizens of other developed nations, R. Fowler, A.&#xD; Hertzke, &amp; L. Olson, Religion and

    cially important role in their lives, Pew Global Attitudes&#xD; Project, Among Wealthy Nations
    U. S. Stands Alone in its&#xD; Embrace of Religion (Dec. 19, 2002). Those who would&#xD;
    renegotiate the boundaries between church and state must&#xD; therefore answer a difficult
    question: Why would we trade&#xD; a system that has served us so well for one that has
    served&#xD; others so poorly?&#xD; Our guiding principle has been James Madison’s—that&#xD;

    O’CONNOR, J., concurring&#xD; &#xD; When we enforce these restrictions, we do so for the&#xD;
    same reason that guided the Framers—respect for relig-&#xD; ion’s special role in society. Our
    Founders conceived of a&#xD; Republic receptive to voluntary religious expression, and&#xD;
    provided for the possibility of judicial intervention when&#xD; government action threatens or
    impedes such expression.&#xD; Voluntary religious belief and expression may be as&#xD;
    threatened when government takes the mantle of religion&#xD; upon itself as when government
    directly interferes with&#xD; private religious practices. When the government associ-&#xD; ates
    one set of religious beliefs with the state and identi-&#xD; fies nonadherents as outsiders, it
    encroaches upon the&#xD; individual’s decision about whether and how to worship.&#xD; In the
    marketplace of ideas, the government has vast&#xD; resources and special status. Government
    religious ex-&#xD; pression therefore risks crowding out private observance&#xD; and distorting
    the natural interplay between competing&#xD; beliefs. Allowing government to be a potential
    mouthpiece&#xD; for competing religious ideas risks the sort of division that&#xD; might easily
    spill over into suppression of rival beliefs.&#xD; Tying secular and religious authority
    together poses risks to&#xD; both.&#xD; Given the history of this particular display of the
    Ten&#xD; Commandments, the Court correctly finds an Establish-&#xD; ment Clause violation. See
    ante, at 19–25. The purpose&#xD; behind the counties’ display is relevant because it
    conveys&#xD; an unmistakable message of endorsement to the reason-&#xD; able observer. See Lynch
    v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 690&#xD; (1984) (O’CONNOR, J., concurring).&#xD; It is true that
    many Americans find the Commandments&#xD; in accord with their personal beliefs. But we do not
    count&#xD; heads before enforcing the First Amendment. See West&#xD; Virginia Bd. of Ed. v.
    Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 638 (1943)&#xD; (“The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to
    withdraw&#xD; certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political contro-&#xD; versy, to place
    them beyond the reach of majorities and&#xD; 4 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD;
    &#xD; UNION OF KY. &#xD; &#xD; O’CONNOR, J., concurring &#xD; &#xD; &#xD; officials and to
    establish them as legal principles to be&#xD; applied by the courts”). Nor can we accept the
    theory that&#xD; Americans who do not accept the Commandments’ validity&#xD; are outside the
    First Amendment’s protections. There is no&#xD; list of approved and disapproved beliefs
    appended to the&#xD; First Amendment—and the Amendment’s broad terms&#xD; (“free exercise,”
    “establishment,” “religion”) do not admit of&#xD; such a cramped reading. It is true that the
    Framers lived&#xD; at a time when our national religious diversity was nei-&#xD; ther as robust
    nor as well recognized as it is now. They&#xD; may not have foreseen the variety of religions
    for which&#xD; this Nation would eventually provide a home. They surely&#xD; could not have
    predicted new religions, some of them born&#xD; in this country. But they did know that
    line-drawing&#xD; between religions is an enterprise that, once begun, has no&#xD; logical
    stopping point. They worried that “the same au-&#xD; thority which can establish Christianity,
    in exclusion of all&#xD; other Religions, may establish with the same ease any&#xD; particular
    sect of Christians, in exclusion of all other&#xD; Sects.” Memorial 186. The Religion Clauses,
    as a result,&#xD; protect adherents of all religions, as well as those who&#xD; believe in no
    religion at all.&#xD; * * *&#xD; We owe our First Amendment to a generation with a&#xD; profound
    commitment to religion and a profound commit-&#xD; ment to religious liberty—visionaries who
    held their faith&#xD; “with enough confidence to believe that what should be&#xD; rendered to
    God does not need to be decided and collected&#xD; by Caesar.” Zorach, supra, at 324–325
    (Jackson, J., dis-&#xD; senting). In my opinion, the display at issue was an estab-&#xD;
    lishment of religion in violation of our Constitution. For&#xD; the reasons given above, I join
    in the Court’s opinion.&#xD; Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005) 1&#xD; &#xD; SCALIA, J.,

    was attending in Rome, Italy&#xD; an international conference of judges and lawyers,
    princi-&#xD; pally from Europe and the United States. That night and&#xD; the next morning
    virtually all of the participants watched,&#xD; in their hotel rooms, the address to the Nation
    by the&#xD; President of the United States concerning the murderous&#xD; attacks upon the Twin
    Towers and the Pentagon, in which&#xD; thousands of Americans had been killed. The address&#xD;
    ended, as Presidential addresses often do, with the prayer&#xD; “God bless America.” The next
    afternoon I was ap-&#xD; 2 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; &#xD; UNION OF KY.
    &#xD; &#xD; SCALIA, J., dissenting &#xD; &#xD; &#xD; proached by one of the judges from a
    European country,&#xD; who, after extending his profound condolences for my&#xD; country’s loss,
    sadly observed “How I wish that the Head&#xD; of State of my country, at a similar time of
    national trag-&#xD; edy and distress, could conclude his address ‘God bless&#xD; ______.’ It is
    of course absolutely forbidden.”&#xD; That is one model of the relationship between church&#xD;
    and state—a model spread across Europe by the armies of&#xD; Napoleon, and reflected in the
    Constitution of France,&#xD; which begins “France is [a] . . . secular . . . Republic.”&#xD;
    France Const., Art. 1, in 7 Constitutions of the Countries&#xD; of the World, p. 1 (G. Flanz ed.
    2000). Religion is to be&#xD; strictly excluded from the public forum. This is not, and&#xD;
    never was, the model adopted by America. George Wash-&#xD; ington added to the form of
    Presidential oath prescribed&#xD; by Art. II, §1, cl. 8, of the Constitution, the
    concluding&#xD; words “so help me God.” See Blomquist, The Presidential&#xD; Oath, the American
    National Interest and a Call for Pre-&#xD; siprudence, 73 UMKC L. Rev. 1, 34 (2004). The
    Supreme&#xD; Court under John Marshall opened its sessions with the&#xD; prayer, “God save the
    United States and this Honorable&#xD; Court.” 1 C. Warren, The Supreme Court in United
    States&#xD; History 469 (rev. ed. 1926). The First Congress instituted&#xD; the practice of
    beginning its legislative sessions with a&#xD; prayer. Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783, 787
    (1983).&#xD; The same week that Congress submitted the Establish-&#xD; ment Clause as part of
    the Bill of Rights for ratification by&#xD; the States, it enacted legislation providing for
    paid chap-&#xD; lains in the House and Senate. Id., at 788. The day after&#xD; the First
    Amendment was proposed, the same Congress&#xD; that had proposed it requested the President to
    proclaim&#xD; “ a day of public thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed,&#xD; by acknowledging,
    with grateful hearts, the many and&#xD; signal favours of Almighty God.” See H. R. Jour.,

    grati-&#xD; tude to God that continues today. See Wallace v. Jaffree,&#xD; 472 U. S. 38, 100–103
    (1985) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting).1&#xD; The same Congress also reenacted the Northwest
    Terri-&#xD; tory Ordinance of 1787, 1 Stat. 50, Article III of which&#xD; provided: “Religion,
    morality, and knowledge, being neces-&#xD; sary to good government and the happiness of
    mankind,&#xD; schools and the means of education shall forever be en-&#xD; couraged.” Id., at
    52, n. (a). And of course the First&#xD; Amendment itself accords religion (and no other
    manner&#xD; of belief) special constitutional protection.&#xD; These actions of our First
    President and Congress and&#xD; the Marshall Court were not idiosyncratic; they reflected&#xD;
    the beliefs of the period. Those who wrote the Constitu-&#xD; tion believed that morality was
    essential to the well-being&#xD; of society and that encouragement of religion was the best&#xD;
    way to foster morality. The “fact that the Founding Fa-&#xD; thers believed devotedly that there
    was a God and that the&#xD; unalienable rights of man were rooted in Him is clearly&#xD;

    dissenting &#xD; &#xD; &#xD; Washington opened his Presidency with a prayer, see&#xD; Inaugural
    Addresses of the Presidents of the United&#xD; States 1, 2 (1989), and reminded his fellow
    citizens at the&#xD; conclusion of it that “reason and experience both forbid us&#xD; to expect
    that National morality can prevail in exclusion of&#xD; religious principle.” Farewell Address
    (1796), reprinted in&#xD; 35 Writings of George Washington 229 (J. Fitzpatrick ed.&#xD; 1940).
    President John Adams wrote to the Massachusetts&#xD; Militia, “we have no government armed with
    power capa-&#xD; ble of contending with human passions unbridled by mo-&#xD; rality and
    religion. . . . Our Constitution was made only&#xD; for a moral and religious people. It is
    wholly inadequate&#xD; to the government of any other.” Letter (Oct. 11, 1798),&#xD; reprinted
    in 9 Works of John Adams 229 (C. Adams ed.&#xD; 1971). Thomas Jefferson concluded his second
    inaugural&#xD; address by inviting his audience to pray:&#xD; “I shall need, too, the favor of
    that Being in whose&#xD; hands we are, who led our fathers, as Israel of old,&#xD; from their
    native land and planted them in a country&#xD; flowing with all the necessaries and comforts of
    life;&#xD; who has covered our infancy with His providence and&#xD; our riper years with His

    Presidents of the United States, at 18, 22–23.&#xD; James Madison, in his first inaugural
    address, likewise&#xD; placed his confidence “in the guardianship and guidance of&#xD; that

    &#xD; SCALIA, J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD; fervent supplications and best hopes for the future.”
    Id.,&#xD; at 25, 28.&#xD; Nor have the views of our people on this matter signifi-&#xD; cantly
    changed. Presidents continue to conclude the Presi-&#xD; dential oath with the words “so help me
    God.” Our legisla-&#xD; tures, state and national, continue to open their sessions&#xD; with
    prayer led by official chaplains. The sessions of this&#xD; Court continue to open with the
    prayer “God save the&#xD; United States and this Honorable Court.” Invocation of&#xD; the
    Almighty by our public figures, at all levels of govern-&#xD; ment, remains commonplace. Our
    coinage bears the motto&#xD; “IN GOD WE TRUST.” And our Pledge of Allegiance&#xD; contains the
    acknowledgment that we are a Nation “under&#xD; God.” As one of our Supreme Court opinions
    rightly ob-&#xD; served, “We are a religious people whose institutions&#xD; presuppose a Supreme
    Being.” Zorach v. Clauson, 343&#xD; U. S. 306, 313 (1952), repeated with approval in Lynch
    v.&#xD; Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 675 (1984); Marsh, 463 U. S., at&#xD; 792; Abington Township,
    supra, at 213.&#xD; With all of this reality (and much more) staring it in the&#xD; face, how
    can the Court possibly assert that “ ‘the First&#xD; Amendment mandates governmental neutrality
    between&#xD; . . . religion and nonreligion,’ ” ante, at 11, and that&#xD; “[m]anifesting a
    purpose to favor . . . adherence to religion&#xD; generally,” ante, at 12, is unconstitutional?
    Who says so?&#xD; Surely not the words of the Constitution. Surely not the&#xD; history and
    traditions that reflect our society’s constant&#xD; understanding of those words. Surely not
    even the cur-&#xD; rent sense of our society, recently reflected in an Act of&#xD; Congress
    adopted unanimously by the Senate and with&#xD; only 5 nays in the House of Representatives, see
    148 Cong.&#xD; Rec. S6226 (2002); id., at H7186, criticizing a Court of&#xD; Appeals opinion
    that had held “under God” in the Pledge&#xD; of Allegiance unconstitutional. See Act of Nov. 13,
    2002,&#xD; §§1(9), 2(a), 3(a), 116 Stat. 2057, 2058, 2060–2061 (reaf-&#xD; firming the Pledge of

    stating that the Pledge of Alle-&#xD; giance is “clearly consistent with the text and intent of
    the&#xD; Constitution”). Nothing stands behind the Court’s asser-&#xD; tion that governmental
    affirmation of the society’s belief in&#xD; God is unconstitutional except the Court’s own
    say-so,&#xD; citing as support only the unsubstantiated say-so of earlier&#xD; Courts going back
    no farther than the mid-20th century.&#xD; See ante, at 11, citing Corporation of Presiding
    Bishop of&#xD; Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483&#xD; U. S. 327, 335
    (1987), in turn citing Lemon v. Kurtzman,&#xD; 403 U. S. 602, 612 (1971), in turn citing Board

    quoting Abington Township, supra, at 222, in&#xD; turn citing Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing,
    330 U. S. 1, 15&#xD; (1947).2 And it is, moreover, a thoroughly discredited say-&#xD; so. It is
    discredited, to begin with, because a majority of&#xD; the Justices on the current Court
    (including at least one&#xD; Member of today’s majority) have, in separate opinions,&#xD;
    repudiated the brain-spun “Lemon test” that embodies the&#xD; supposed principle of neutrality
    between religion and&#xD; irreligion. See Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union&#xD; Free

    a&#xD; review of historical evidence that focused on the debate leading up to the&#xD; passage
    of the Virginia Bill for Religious Liberty, see id., at 11–13. A&#xD; prominent commentator of
    the time remarked (after a thorough review of&#xD; the evidence himself) that it appeared the

    dissenting) (disparaging “the sisyphean&#xD; task of trying to patch together the ‘blurred,
    indistinct, and&#xD; variable barrier’ described in Lemon”). And it is discredited&#xD; because
    the Court has not had the courage (or the foolhar-&#xD; diness) to apply the neutrality
    principle consistently.&#xD; What distinguishes the rule of law from the dictatorship&#xD; of a
    shifting Supreme Court majority is the absolutely&#xD; indispensable requirement that judicial
    opinions be&#xD; grounded in consistently applied principle. That is what&#xD; prevents judges
    from ruling now this way, now that—&#xD; thumbs up or thumbs down—as their personal
    preferences&#xD; dictate. Today’s opinion forthrightly (or actually, some-&#xD; what less than
    forthrightly) admits that it does not rest&#xD; upon consistently applied principle. In a
    revealing foot-&#xD; note, ante, at 11, n. 10, the Court acknowledges that the&#xD;
    “Establishment Clause doctrine” it purports to be applying&#xD; “lacks the comfort of
    categorical absolutes.” What the&#xD; Court means by this lovely euphemism is that
    sometimes&#xD; the Court chooses to decide cases on the principle that&#xD; government cannot
    favor religion, and sometimes it does&#xD; not. The footnote goes on to say that “[i]n special
    in-&#xD; stances we have found good reason” to dispense with the&#xD; principle, but “[n]o such
    reasons present themselves here.”&#xD; Ibid. It does not identify all of those “special
    instances,”&#xD; much less identify the “good reason” for their existence.&#xD; I have cataloged
    elsewhere the variety of circumstances&#xD; in which this Court—even after its embrace of
    Lemon’s&#xD; stated prohibition of such behavior—has approved gov-&#xD; ernment action
    “undertaken with the specific intention of&#xD; improving the position of religion,” Edwards v.
    Aguillard,&#xD; 482 U. S. 578, 616 (1987) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). See id.,&#xD; 8 MCCREARY
    COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD; SCALIA, J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD;
    616–618. Suffice it to say here that when the government&#xD; relieves churches from the
    obligation to pay property&#xD; taxes, when it allows students to absent themselves from&#xD;
    public school to take religious classes, and when it ex-&#xD; empts religious organizations from
    generally applicable&#xD; prohibitions of religious discrimination, it surely means to&#xD;
    bestow a benefit on religious practice—but we have ap-&#xD; proved it. See Amos, supra, at 338
    (exemption from federal&#xD; prohibition of religious discrimination by employers); Walz&#xD; v.
    Tax Comm’n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 673&#xD; (1970) (property tax exemption for
    church property); Zorach,&#xD; 343 U. S., at 308, 315 (law permitting students to leave&#xD;
    public school for the purpose of receiving religious educa-&#xD; tion). Indeed, we have even
    approved (post-Lemon) gov-&#xD; ernment-led prayer to God. In Marsh v. Chambers, supra,&#xD; the
    Court upheld the Nebraska State Legislature’s prac-&#xD; tice of paying a chaplain to lead it in
    prayer at the opening&#xD; of legislative sessions. The Court explained that “[t]o&#xD; invoke
    Divine guidance on a public body entrusted with&#xD; making the laws is not . . . an
    ‘establishment’ of religion or&#xD; a step toward establishment; it is simply a tolerable
    ac-&#xD; knowledgment of beliefs widely held among the people of&#xD; this country.” 463 U. S.,
    at 792. (Why, one wonders, is not&#xD; respect for the Ten Commandments a tolerable
    acknowl-&#xD; edgment of beliefs widely held among the people of this&#xD; country?)&#xD; The
    only “good reason” for ignoring the neutrality prin-&#xD; ciple set forth in any of these cases
    was the antiquity of&#xD; the practice at issue. See Marsh, supra, at 786–792, 794;&#xD; Walz,
    supra, at 676–680. That would be a good reason for&#xD; finding the neutrality principle a
    mistaken interpretation&#xD; of the Constitution, but it is hardly a good reason for&#xD;
    letting an unconstitutional practice continue. We did not&#xD; hide behind that reason in
    Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533&#xD; (1964), which found unconstitutional bicameral state&#xD;
    legislatures of a sort that had existed since the beginning&#xD; Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)
    9&#xD; &#xD; SCALIA, J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD; of the Republic. And almost monthly, it seems,
    the Court&#xD; has not shrunk from invalidating aspects of criminal&#xD; procedure and penology
    of similar vintage. See, e.g., Deck&#xD; v. Missouri, 544 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at
    10–11)&#xD; (invalidating practice of shackling defendants absent&#xD; “special circumstances”);
    id., at ___ (slip op., at 7–11)&#xD; (THOMAS, J., dissenting); Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S.
    ___,&#xD; ___ (2005) (slip op., at 14) (invalidating practice of execut-&#xD; ing
    under-18-year-old offenders); id., at ___ (slip op., at 2,&#xD; n. 1) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).
    What, then, could be the&#xD; genuine “good reason” for occasionally ignoring the neu-&#xD;
    trality principle? I suggest it is the instinct for self-&#xD; preservation, and the recognition
    that the Court, which&#xD; “has no influence over either the sword or the purse,” The&#xD;
    Federalist No. 78, p. 412 (J. Pole ed. 2005), cannot go too&#xD; far down the road of an
    enforced neutrality that contra-&#xD; dicts both historical fact and current practice
    without&#xD; losing all that sustains it: the willingness of the people to&#xD; accept its
    interpretation of the Constitution as definitive,&#xD; in preference to the contrary
    interpretation of the democ-&#xD; ratically elected branches.&#xD; Besides appealing to the
    demonstrably false principle&#xD; that the government cannot favor religion over
    irreligion,&#xD; today’s opinion suggests that the posting of the Ten Com-&#xD; mandments
    violates the principle that the government&#xD; cannot favor one religion over another. See
    ante, at 19;&#xD; see also Van Orden, ante, at 11–13 (STEVENS, J., dissent-&#xD; ing). That is
    indeed a valid principle where public aid or&#xD; assistance to religion is concerned, see
    Zelman v. Sim-&#xD; mons-Harris, 536 U. S. 639, 652 (2002), or where the free&#xD; exercise of
    religion is at issue, Church of Lukumi Babalu&#xD; Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 532–533
    (1993); id., at&#xD; 557–558 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in&#xD; judgment),
    but it necessarily applies in a more limited&#xD; sense to public acknowledgment of the Creator.
    If religion&#xD; in the public forum had to be entirely nondenominational,&#xD; 10 MCCREARY
    COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD; SCALIA, J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD;
    there could be no religion in the public forum at all. One&#xD; cannot say the word “God,” or
    “the Almighty,” one cannot&#xD; offer public supplication or thanksgiving, without contra-&#xD;
    dicting the beliefs of some people that there are many&#xD; gods, or that God or the gods pay no
    attention to human&#xD; affairs. With respect to public acknowledgment of reli-&#xD; gious
    belief, it is entirely clear from our Nation’s historical&#xD; practices that the Establishment
    Clause permits this&#xD; disregard of polytheists and believers in unconcerned&#xD; deities,
    just as it permits the disregard of devout atheists.&#xD; The Thanksgiving Proclamation issued
    by George Wash-&#xD; ington at the instance of the First Congress was scrupu-&#xD; lously
    nondenominational—but it was monotheistic. 3 In&#xD; Marsh v. Chambers, supra, we said that the
    fact the par-&#xD; ticular prayers offered in the Nebraska Legislature were&#xD; “in the
    Judeo-Christian tradition,” id., at 793, posed no&#xD; additional problem, because “there is no
    indication that&#xD; the prayer opportunity has been exploited to proselytize or&#xD; advance
    any one, or to disparage any other, faith or be-&#xD; lief,” id., at 794–795.&#xD; Historical
    practices thus demonstrate that there is a&#xD; distance between the acknowledgment of a single
    Creator&#xD; and the establishment of a religion. The former is, as&#xD; Marsh v. Chambers put
    it, “a tolerable acknowledgment of&#xD; beliefs widely held among the people of this country.”

    all the in-&#xD; stances of invocation of the deity I have cited) “was the God of monothe-&#xD;
    ism.” Ante, at 32. This reaction would be more comprehensible if the&#xD; Court could suggest
    what other God (in the singular, and with a capital&#xD; G) there is, other than “the God of
    monotheism." This is not necessarily&#xD; the Christian God (though if it were, one would expect
    Christ regu-&#xD; larly to be invoked, which He is not); but it is inescapably the God of&#xD;

    Commandments were&#xD; given by God to Moses, and are divine prescriptions for a&#xD; virtuous
    life. See 13 Encyclopedia of Religion 9074 (2d ed.&#xD; 2005); The Qur’an 104 (M. Haleem trans.
    2004). Publicly&#xD; honoring the Ten Commandments is thus indistinguish-&#xD; able, insofar as
    discriminating against other religions is&#xD; concerned, from publicly honoring God. Both
    practices are&#xD; recognized across such a broad and diverse range of the&#xD; population—from
    Christians to Muslims—that they can-&#xD; not be reasonably understood as a government
    endorse-&#xD; ment of a particular religious viewpoint.4&#xD; B&#xD; A few remarks are necessary
    in response to the criticism&#xD; of this dissent by the Court, as well as JUSTICE STEVENS’&#xD;
    criticism in the related case of Van Orden v. Perry, ante, p.&#xD; 1. JUSTICE STEVENS’ writing
    is largely devoted to an&#xD; attack upon a straw man. “[R]eliance on early religious&#xD;
    proclamations and statements made by the Founders is&#xD; . . . problematic,” he says, “because
    those views were not&#xD; espoused at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 nor&#xD; enshrined
    in the Constitution’s text.” Van Orden, ante, at&#xD; 18–19 (dissenting opinion) (footnote
    omitted). But I have&#xD; not relied upon (as he and the Court in this case do) mere&#xD;
    “proclamations and statements” of the Founders. I have&#xD; ——————&#xD; 4 This is not to say
    that a display of the Ten Commandments could&#xD; never constitute an impermissible endorsement
    of a particular religious&#xD; view. The Establishment Clause would prohibit, for example,
    govern-&#xD; mental endorsement of a particular version of the Decalogue as au-&#xD;
    thoritative. Here the display of the Ten Commandments alongside&#xD; eight secular documents,
    and the plaque’s explanation for their inclu-&#xD; sion, make clear that they were not posted to
    take sides in a theological&#xD; dispute.&#xD; 12 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL
    LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD; SCALIA, J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD; relied primarily upon
    official acts and official proclama-&#xD; tions of the United States or of the component
    branches of&#xD; its Government, including the First Congress’s beginning&#xD; of the tradition
    of legislative prayer to God, its appoint-&#xD; ment of congressional chaplains, its legislative
    proposal of&#xD; a Thanksgiving Proclamation, and its reenactment of the&#xD; Northwest
    Territory Ordinance; our first President’s&#xD; issuance of a Thanksgiving Proclamation; and
    invocation&#xD; of God at the opening of sessions of the Supreme Court.&#xD; The only mere
    “proclamations and statements” of the&#xD; Founders I have relied upon were statements of
    Founders&#xD; who occupied federal office, and spoke in at least a quasi-&#xD; official
    capacity—Washington’s prayer at the opening of&#xD; his Presidency and his Farewell Address,
    President John&#xD; Adams’ letter to the Massachusetts Militia, and Jefferson’s&#xD; and
    Madison’s inaugural addresses. The Court and&#xD; JUSTICE STEVENS, by contrast, appeal to no
    official or even&#xD; quasi-official action in support of their view of the Estab-&#xD; lishment
    Clause—only James Madison’s Memorial and&#xD; Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments,
    written&#xD; before the federal Constitution had even been proposed,&#xD; two letters written by
    Madison long after he was Presi-&#xD; dent, and the quasi-official inaction of Thomas Jefferson
    in&#xD; refusing to issue a Thanksgiving Proclamation. See ante,&#xD; at 30–31; Van Orden, ante,
    at 19 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).&#xD; The Madison Memorial and Remonstrance, dealing as it&#xD;
    does with enforced contribution to religion rather than&#xD; public acknowledgment of God, is
    irrelevant; one of the&#xD; letters is utterly ambiguous as to the point at issue here,&#xD; and
    should not be read to contradict Madison’s statements&#xD; in his first inaugural address,
    quoted earlier; even the&#xD; other letter does not disapprove public acknowledgment of&#xD;
    God, unless one posits (what Madison’s own actions as&#xD; President would contradict) that
    reference to God contra-&#xD; dicts “the equality of all religious sects.” See Letter from&#xD;

    &amp; R.&#xD; Lerner eds. 1987). And as to Jefferson: the notoriously&#xD; self-contradicting
    Jefferson did not choose to have his&#xD; nonauthorship of a Thanksgiving Proclamation
    inscribed&#xD; on his tombstone. What he did have inscribed was his&#xD; authorship of the
    Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom,&#xD; a governmental act which begins “Whereas Almighty
    God&#xD; hath created the mind free . . . .” Va. Code Ann. §57–1&#xD; (Lexis 2003).&#xD; It is
    no answer for JUSTICE STEVENS to say that the&#xD; understanding that these official and
    quasi-official actions&#xD; reflect was not “enshrined in the Constitution’s text.” Van&#xD;
    Orden, ante, at 18 (dissenting opinion). The Establish-&#xD; ment Clause, upon which JUSTICE
    STEVENS would rely,&#xD; was enshrined in the Constitution’s text, and these official&#xD;
    actions show what it meant. There were doubtless some&#xD; who thought it should have a broader
    meaning, but those&#xD; views were plainly rejected. JUSTICE STEVENS says that&#xD; reliance on
    these actions is “bound to paint a misleading&#xD; picture,” Van Orden, ante, at 19, but it is
    hard to see why.&#xD; What is more probative of the meaning of the Establish-&#xD; ment Clause
    than the actions of the very Congress that&#xD; proposed it, and of the first President charged
    with observ-&#xD; ing it?&#xD; JUSTICE STEVENS also appeals to the undoubted fact&#xD; that some
    in the founding generation thought that the&#xD; Religion Clauses of the First Amendment should
    have a&#xD; narrower meaning, protecting only the Christian religion&#xD; or perhaps only
    Protestantism. See Van Orden, ante, at&#xD; 20–22. I am at a loss to see how this helps his
    case, except&#xD; by providing a cloud of obfuscating smoke. (Since most&#xD; thought the Clause
    permitted government invocation of&#xD; monotheism, and some others thought it permitted
    gov-&#xD; ernment invocation of Christianity, he proposes that it be&#xD; construed not to
    permit any government invocation of&#xD; religion at all.) At any rate, those narrower views of
    the&#xD; 14 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD; SCALIA, J.,
    dissenting&#xD; &#xD; Establishment Clause were as clearly rejected as the more&#xD; expansive
    ones. Washington’s First Thanksgiving Proc-&#xD; lamation is merely an example. All of the
    actions of Wash-&#xD; ington and the First Congress upon which I have relied,&#xD; virtually all
    Thanksgiving Proclamations throughout our&#xD; history,5 and all the other examples of our
    Government’s&#xD; favoring religion that I have cited, have invoked God, but&#xD; not Jesus
    Christ.6 Rather than relying upon JUSTICE&#xD; STEVENS’ assurance that “[t]he original
    understanding of&#xD; the type of ‘religion’ that qualified for constitutional pro-&#xD; tection
    under the First amendment certainly did not in-&#xD; clude . . . followers of Judaism and
    Islam,” Van Orden,&#xD; ante, at 22; see also ante, at 32–33, I would prefer to take&#xD; the
    word of George Washington, who, in his famous Letter&#xD; to the Hebrew Congregation of Newport,
    Rhode Island,&#xD; wrote that,&#xD; “All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities&#xD;
    of citizenship. It is now no more that toleration is&#xD; spoken of, as if it was by the
    indulgence of one class of&#xD; ——————&#xD; 5 The two exceptions are the March 23, 1798
    proclamation of John&#xD; &#xD; Adams, which asks God “freely to remit all our offenses”
    “through the&#xD; Redeemer of the World,” http://www.pilgrimhall.org/ThanxProc1789.htm,&#xD; and
    the November 17, 1972 proclamation of Richard Nixon, which&#xD; stated, “From Moses at the Red
    Sea to Jesus preparing to feed the&#xD; multitudes, the Scriptures summon us to words and deeds
    of gratitude,&#xD; even before divine blessings are fully perceived,” Presidential Procla-&#xD;
    mation No. 4170, 37 Fed. Reg. 24647 (1972).&#xD; 6 JUSTICE STEVENS finds that Presidential
    inaugural and farewell&#xD; &#xD; speeches (which are the only speeches upon which I have
    relied) do not&#xD; violate the Establishment Clause only because everyone knows that&#xD; they
    express the personal religious views of the speaker, and not&#xD; government policy. See Van
    Orden, ante, at 17–18 (dissenting opinion).&#xD; This is a peculiar stance for one who has voted
    that a student-led&#xD; invocation at a high school football game and a rabbi-led invocation at
    a&#xD; high school graduation did constitute the sort of governmental en-&#xD; dorsement of
    religion that the Establishment Clause forbids. See&#xD; Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v.

    way, with an invocation of the&#xD; one God:&#xD; “May the father of all mercies scatter light
    and not&#xD; darkness in our paths, and make us all in our several&#xD; vocations useful here,
    and in his own due time and&#xD; way everlastingly happy.” Ibid.&#xD; JUSTICE STEVENS says that
    if one is serious about fol-&#xD; lowing the original understanding of the Establishment&#xD;
    Clause, he must repudiate its incorporation into the Four-&#xD; teenth Amendment, and hold that
    it does not apply&#xD; against the States. See Van Orden, ante, at 24–26 (dis-&#xD; senting
    opinion). This is more smoke. JUSTICE STEVENS&#xD; did not feel that way last Term, when he
    joined an opinion&#xD; insisting upon the original meaning of the Confrontation&#xD; Clause, but
    nonetheless applying it against the State of&#xD; Washington. See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.
    S. 36&#xD; (2004). The notion that incorporation empties the incorpo-&#xD; rated provisions of
    their original meaning has no support&#xD; in either reason or precedent.&#xD; JUSTICE STEVENS
    argues that original meaning should&#xD; not be the touchstone anyway, but that we should
    rather&#xD; “expoun[d] the meaning of constitutional provisions with&#xD; one eye towards our
    Nation’s history and the other fixed&#xD; on its democratic aspirations.” Van Orden, ante, at
    27–28&#xD; (dissenting opinion). This is not the place to debate the&#xD; merits of the “living
    Constitution,” though I must observe&#xD; that JUSTICE STEVENS’ quotation from McCulloch v.
    Mary-&#xD; land, 4 Wheat. 316, 407 (1819), refutes rather than sup-&#xD; ports that approach.7
    Even assuming, however, that the&#xD; ——————&#xD; 7 See Scalia, Originalism: The Lesser Evil, 57

    KY.&#xD; SCALIA, J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD; meaning of the Constitution ought to change according
    to&#xD; “democratic aspirations,” why are those aspirations to be&#xD; found in Justices’
    notions of what the Establishment&#xD; Clause ought to mean, rather than in the
    democratically&#xD; adopted dispositions of our current society? As I have&#xD; observed above,
    numerous provisions of our laws and&#xD; numerous continuing practices of our people
    demonstrate&#xD; that the government’s invocation of God (and hence the&#xD; government’s
    invocation of the Ten Commandments) is&#xD; unobjectionable—including a statute enacted by
    Congress&#xD; almost unanimously less than three years ago, stating&#xD; that “under God” in the
    Pledge of Allegiance is constitu-&#xD; tional, see 116 Stat., at 2058. To ignore all this is not
    to&#xD; give effect to “democratic aspirations” but to frustrate&#xD; them.&#xD; Finally, I must
    respond to JUSTICE STEVENS’ assertion&#xD; that I would “marginaliz[e] the belief systems of
    more&#xD; than 7 million Americans” who adhere to religions that are&#xD; not monotheistic. Van
    Orden, ante, at 13–14, n. 18 (dis-&#xD; senting opinion). Surely that is a gross exaggeration.
    The&#xD; beliefs of those citizens are entirely protected by the Free&#xD; Exercise Clause, and
    by those aspects of the Establish-&#xD; ment Clause that do not relate to government
    acknowl-&#xD; edgment of the Creator. Invocation of God despite their&#xD; beliefs is permitted
    not because nonmonotheistic religions&#xD; cease to be religions recognized by the religion
    clauses of&#xD; the First Amendment, but because governmental invoca-&#xD; tion of God is not an
    establishment. JUSTICE STEVENS&#xD; fails to recognize that in the context of public
    acknowl-&#xD; edgments of God there are legitimate competing interests:&#xD; On the one hand,
    the interest of that minority in not&#xD; feeling “excluded”; but on the other, the interest of
    the&#xD; overwhelming majority of religious believers in being able&#xD; to give God thanks and
    supplication as a people, and with&#xD; ——————&#xD; 853 (1989).&#xD; Cite as: 545 U. S. ____

    national tradition&#xD; has resolved that conflict in favor of the majority.8 It is&#xD; not for
    this Court to change a disposition that accounts,&#xD; many Americans think, for the phenomenon
    remarked&#xD; upon in a quotation attributed to various authors, includ-&#xD; ing Bismarck, but
    which I prefer to associate with Charles&#xD; de Gaulle: “God watches over little children,
    drunkards,&#xD; and the United States of America.”&#xD; II&#xD; As bad as the Lemon test is, it
    is worse for the fact that,&#xD; since its inception, its seemingly simple mandates have&#xD;
    been manipulated to fit whatever result the Court aimed&#xD; to achieve. Today’s opinion is no
    different. In two re-&#xD; spects it modifies Lemon to ratchet up the Court’s hostility&#xD; to
    religion. First, the Court justifies inquiry into legisla-&#xD; tive purpose, not as an end
    itself, but as a means to ascer-&#xD; tain the appearance of the government action to an “
    ‘ob-&#xD; jective observer.’ ” Ante, at 13. Because in the Court’s&#xD; view the true danger to
    be guarded against is that the&#xD; objective observer would feel like an “outside[r]” or “not
    [a]&#xD; full membe[r] of the political community,” its inquiry&#xD; focuses not on the actual
    purpose of government action,&#xD; but the “purpose apparent from government action.” Ante,&#xD;
    at 12. Under this approach, even if a government could&#xD; show that its actual purpose was not
    to advance religion,&#xD; it would presumably violate the Constitution as long as&#xD; the
    Court’s objective observer would think otherwise. See&#xD; Capitol Square Review and Advisory
    Bd. v. Pinette, 515&#xD; ——————&#xD; 8 Nothing so clearly demonstrates the utter inconsistency
    of our Es-&#xD; tablishment Clause jurisprudence as JUSTICE O’CONNOR’s stirring&#xD; concurrence
    in the present case. “[W]e do not,” she says, “count heads&#xD; before enforcing the First
    Amendment.” Ante, at 4. But JUSTICE&#xD; O’CONNOR joined the opinion of the Court in Marsh v.
    Chambers, 463&#xD; U. S. 783 (1983) which held legislative prayer to be “a tolerable ac-&#xD;
    knowledgment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country.”&#xD; Id., at 792.&#xD; 18
    MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD; SCALIA, J., dissenting&#xD;
    &#xD; U.S. 753, 776–777 (1995) (O’CONNOR, J., concurring in&#xD; part and concurring in
    judgment) (stating that “when the&#xD; reasonable observer would view a government practice
    as&#xD; endorsing religion, . . . it is our duty to hold the practice&#xD; invalid,” even if the
    law at issue was neutral and the&#xD; benefit conferred on the religious entity was
    incidental).&#xD; I have remarked before that it is an odd jurisprudence&#xD; that bases the
    unconstitutionality of a government prac-&#xD; tice that does not actually advance religion on
    the hopes of&#xD; the government that it would do so. See Edwards, 482&#xD; U. S., at 639. But
    that oddity pales in comparison to the&#xD; one invited by today’s analysis: the legitimacy of a
    gov-&#xD; ernment action with a wholly secular effect would turn on&#xD; the misperception of an
    imaginary observer that the gov-&#xD; ernment officials behind the action had the intent to
    ad-&#xD; vance religion.&#xD; Second, the Court replaces Lemon’s requirement that&#xD; the
    government have “a secular . . . purpose,” 403 U. S., at&#xD; 612 (emphasis added), with the
    heightened requirement&#xD; that the secular purpose “predominate” over any purpose&#xD; to
    advance religion. Ante, at 15–17. The Court treats this&#xD; extension as a natural outgrowth of
    the longstanding&#xD; requirement that the government’s secular purpose not be&#xD; a sham, but
    simple logic shows the two to be unrelated. If&#xD; the government’s proffered secular purpose
    is not genuine,&#xD; then the government has no secular purpose at all. The&#xD; new demand that
    secular purpose predominate contradicts&#xD; Lemon’s more limited requirement, and finds no
    support&#xD; in our cases. In all but one of the five cases in which this&#xD; Court has
    invalidated a government practice on the basis&#xD; of its purpose to benefit religion, it has
    first declared that&#xD; the statute was motivated entirely by the desire to ad-&#xD; vance
    religion. See Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v.&#xD; Doe, 530 U. S. 290, 308–309 (2000)
    (dismissing the school&#xD; district’s proffered secular purposes as shams); Wallace, 472&#xD;
    U. S., at 56 (finding “no secular purpose”) (emphasis&#xD; Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)
    19&#xD; &#xD; SCALIA, J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD; added); Stone v. Graham, 449 U. S. 39, 41 (1980)
    (per&#xD; curiam) (finding that “Kentucky’s statute requiring the&#xD; posting of the Ten
    Commandments in public school rooms&#xD; has no secular legislative purpose”) (emphasis
    added);&#xD; Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97, 107–109 (1968). In&#xD; Edwards, supra, the
    Court did say that the state action&#xD; was invalid because its “primary” or “preeminent”
    purpose&#xD; was to advance a particular religious belief, 482 U. S., at&#xD; 590, 593, 594, but
    that statement was unnecessary to the&#xD; result, since the Court rejected the State’s only
    proffered&#xD; secular purpose as a sham. See id., at 589.&#xD; I have urged that Lemon’s
    purpose prong be abandoned,&#xD; because (as I have discussed in Part I) even an exclusive&#xD;
    purpose to foster or assist religious practice is not neces-&#xD; sarily invalidating. But
    today’s extension makes things&#xD; even worse. By shifting the focus of Lemon’s purpose&#xD;
    prong from the search for a genuine, secular motivation to&#xD; the hunt for a predominantly
    religious purpose, the Court&#xD; converts what has in the past been a fairly limited
    inquiry&#xD; into a rigorous review of the full record.9 Those responsi-&#xD; ble for the
    adoption of the Religion Clauses would surely&#xD; regard it as a bitter irony that the
    religious values they&#xD; ——————&#xD; 9 The Court’s reflexive skepticism of the government’s
    asserted secu-&#xD; &#xD; lar purposes is flatly inconsistent with the deferential approach
    taken&#xD; by our previous Establishment Clause cases. We have repeated many&#xD; times that,
    where a court undertakes the sensitive task of reviewing a&#xD; government’s asserted purpose,
    it must take the government at its&#xD; word absent compelling evidence to the contrary. See,
    e.g., Edwards v.&#xD; Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 586 (stating that “the Court is . . .
    deferential to&#xD; a State’s articulation of a secular purpose,” unless that purpose is
    insin-&#xD; cere or a sham); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 394–395 (1983) (ascribing&#xD; the
    Court’s disinclination to invalidate government practices under&#xD; Lemon’s purpose prong to
    its “reluctance to attribute unconstitutional&#xD; motives to the States, particularly when a
    plausible secular purpose for&#xD; the State’s program may be discerned from the face of the
    statute”); see&#xD; also Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 74 (O’CONNOR, J., concurring in&#xD;
    judgment) (“the inquiry into the purpose of the legislature . . . should be&#xD; deferential and
    limited”).&#xD; 20 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD; SCALIA,
    J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD; designed those Clauses to protect have now become so&#xD; distasteful
    to this Court that if they constitute anything&#xD; more than a subordinate motive for
    government action&#xD; they will invalidate it.&#xD; III&#xD; Even accepting the Court’s
    Lemon-based premises, the&#xD; displays at issue here were constitutional.&#xD; A&#xD; To any
    person who happened to walk down the hallway&#xD; of the McCreary or Pulaski County Courthouse
    during the&#xD; roughly nine months when the Foundations Displays were&#xD; exhibited, the
    displays must have seemed unremarkable—&#xD; if indeed they were noticed at all. The walls of
    both court-&#xD; houses were already lined with historical documents and&#xD; other assorted
    portraits; each Foundations Display was&#xD; exhibited in the same format as these other
    displays and&#xD; nothing in the record suggests that either County took&#xD; steps to give it
    greater prominence.&#xD; Entitled “The Foundations of American Law and Gov-&#xD; ernment
    Display,” each display consisted of nine equally&#xD; sized documents: the original version of
    the Magna Carta,&#xD; the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, the&#xD; Star
    Spangled Banner, the Mayflower Compact of 1620, a&#xD; picture of Lady Justice, the National
    Motto of the United&#xD; States (“In God We Trust”), the Preamble to the Kentucky&#xD;
    Constitution, and the Ten Commandments. The displays&#xD; did not emphasize any of the nine
    documents in any way:&#xD; The frame holding the Ten Commandments was of the&#xD; same size and
    had the same appearance as that which&#xD; held each of the other documents. See 354 F. 3d 438,
    443&#xD; (CA6 2003).&#xD; Posted with the documents was a plaque, identifying the&#xD; display,
    and explaining that it “contains documents that&#xD; played a significant role in the foundation
    of our system of&#xD; Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005) 21&#xD; &#xD; SCALIA, J., dissenting&#xD;
    &#xD; law and government.” Ibid. The explanation related to&#xD; the Ten Commandments was third
    in the list of nine and&#xD; did not serve to distinguish it from the other documents.&#xD; It
    stated:&#xD; “The Ten Commandments have profoundly influ-&#xD; enced the formation of Western
    legal thought and the&#xD; formation of our country. That influence is clearly&#xD; seen in the
    Declaration of Independence, which de-&#xD; clared that, ‘We hold these truths to be
    self-evident,&#xD; that all men are created equal, that they are endowed&#xD; by their Creator
    with certain unalienable Rights, that&#xD; among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of
    Hap-&#xD; piness.’ The Ten Commandments provide the moral&#xD; background of the Declaration of
    Independence and&#xD; the foundation of our legal tradition.” Ibid.&#xD; B&#xD; On its face, the
    Foundations Displays manifested the&#xD; purely secular purpose that the Counties asserted
    before&#xD; the District Court: “to display documents that played a&#xD; significant role in the
    foundation of our system of law and&#xD; government.” Affidavit of Judge Jimmie Green in

    That the&#xD; Displays included the Ten Commandments did not trans-&#xD; form their apparent
    secular purpose into one of impermis-&#xD; sible advocacy for Judeo-Christian beliefs. Even an
    iso-&#xD; lated display of the Decalogue conveys, at worst, “an&#xD; equivocal message, perhaps
    of respect for Judaism, for&#xD; religion in general, or for law.” Allegheny County, 492&#xD; U.
    S., at 652 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissent-&#xD; ing in part). But when the Ten
    Commandments appear&#xD; alongside other documents of secular significance in a&#xD; display
    devoted to the foundations of American law and&#xD; government, the context communicates that
    the Ten&#xD; 22 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD; SCALIA, J.,
    dissenting&#xD; &#xD; Commandments are included, not to teach their binding&#xD; nature as a
    religious text, but to show their unique contri-&#xD; bution to the development of the legal
    system. See id., at&#xD; 652–653. This is doubly true when the display is intro-&#xD; duced by a
    document that informs passersby that it “con-&#xD; tains documents that played a significant
    role in the foun-&#xD; dation of our system of law and government.”&#xD; The same result follows
    if the Ten Commandments&#xD; display is viewed in light of the government practices that&#xD;
    this Court has countenanced in the past. The acknowl-&#xD; edgment of the contribution that
    religion in general, and&#xD; the Ten Commandments in particular, have made to our&#xD; Nation’s
    legal and governmental heritage is surely no&#xD; more of a step towards establishment of
    religion than was&#xD; the practice of legislative prayer we approved in Marsh v.&#xD; Chambers,
    463 U. S. 783 (1983), and it seems to be on par&#xD; with the inclusion of a crèche or a menorah
    in a “Holiday”&#xD; display that incorporates other secular symbols, see Lynch,&#xD; supra, at
    679–680; Allegheny County, supra, at 621. The&#xD; parallels between this case and Marsh and
    Lynch are&#xD; sufficiently compelling that they ought to decide this case,&#xD; even under the
    Court’s misguided Establishment Clause&#xD; jurisprudence.10&#xD; ——————&#xD; 10 The Court’s
    only response is that the inclusion of the Ten Com-&#xD; mandments in a display about the
    foundations of American law reflects&#xD; “a purpose to call on citizens to act in prescribed
    ways as a personal&#xD; response to divine authority,” in a way that legislative prayer and
    the&#xD; inclusion of a crèche in a Holiday display do not. See ante, at 30, n. 24.&#xD; That
    might be true if the Commandments were displayed by them-&#xD; selves in a church, or even in
    someone’s home. It seems to me patently&#xD; untrue—given the Decalogue’s “undeniable historical
    meaning” as a&#xD; symbol of the religious foundations of law, see Van Orden, ante, at 11&#xD;
    (plurality opinion)—when they are posted in a courthouse display of&#xD; historical documents.
    The observer would no more think himself&#xD; “called upon to act” in conformance with the
    Commandments than he&#xD; would think himself called upon to think and act like William
    Bradford&#xD; because of the courthouse posting of the Mayflower Compact—&#xD; Cite as: 545 U.
    S. ____ (2005) 23&#xD; &#xD; SCALIA, J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD; Acknowledgment of the
    contribution that religion has&#xD; made to our Nation’s legal and governmental heritage&#xD;
    partakes of a centuries-old tradition. Members of this&#xD; Court have themselves often detailed
    the degree to which&#xD; religious belief pervaded the National Government during&#xD; the
    founding era. See Lynch, supra, at 674–678; Marsh,&#xD; supra, at 786–788; Lee v. Weisman, 505
    U. S. 577, 633–636&#xD; (1992) (SCALIA, J., dissenting); Wallace, 472 U. S. at 100–&#xD; 106
    (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting); Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S.&#xD; 421, 446–450, and n. 3 (1962)
    (Stewart, J., dissenting).&#xD; Display of the Ten Commandments is well within the&#xD;
    mainstream of this practice of acknowledgment. Federal,&#xD; State, and local governments across
    the Nation have&#xD; engaged in such display.11 The Supreme Court Building&#xD; itself includes
    depictions of Moses with the Ten Com-&#xD; mandments in the Courtroom and on the east pediment
    of&#xD; the building, and symbols of the Ten Commandments&#xD; “adorn the metal gates lining the
    north and south sides of&#xD; the Courtroom as well as the doors leading into the Court-&#xD;
    room.” Van Orden, ante, at 9 (plurality opinion). Similar&#xD; depictions of the Decalogue
    appear on public buildings and&#xD; monuments throughout our Nation’s Capital. Ibid. The&#xD;
    &#xD; ——————&#xD; especially when he is told that the exhibit consists of documents that&#xD;
    contributed to American law and government.&#xD; 11 The significant number of cases involving
    Ten Commandments&#xD; &#xD; displays in the last two years suggests the breadth of their
    appearance.&#xD; See, e.g., Books v. Elkhart County, 401 F. 3d 857, 858–859 (CA7 2005)&#xD; (Ten
    Commandments included in a display identical to the Foundations&#xD; display); Mercier v.
    Fraternal Order of Eagles, 395 F. 3d 693, 696 (CA7&#xD; 2005) (Ten Commandments monument in city
    park since 1965);&#xD; Modrovich v. Allegheny County, 385 F. 3d 397, 399 (CA3 2004) (Ten&#xD;
    Commandments plaque, donated in 1918, on wall of Allegheny County&#xD; Courthouse); Freethought
    Soc. of Greater Philadelphia v. Chester&#xD; County, 334 F. 3d 247, 249 (CA3 2003) (Ten
    Commandment plaque,&#xD; donated in 1920, on wall of Chester County Courthouse); King v.&#xD;
    Richmond County, 331 F. 3d 1271, 1273–1274 (CA11 2003) (Ten Com-&#xD; mandments depicted in
    county seal since 1872).&#xD; 24 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF
    KY.&#xD; SCALIA, J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD; frequency of these displays testifies to the popular
    un-&#xD; derstanding that the Ten Commandments are a founda-&#xD; tion of the rule of law, and a
    symbol of the role that&#xD; religion played, and continues to play, in our system of&#xD;
    government.&#xD; Perhaps in recognition of the centrality of the Ten Com-&#xD; mandments as a
    widely recognized symbol of religion in&#xD; public life, the Court is at pains to dispel the
    impression&#xD; that its decision will require governments across the coun-&#xD; try to
    sandblast the Ten Commandments from the public&#xD; square. See ante, at 26. The constitutional
    problem, the&#xD; Court says, is with the Counties’ purpose in erecting the&#xD; Foundations
    Displays, not the displays themselves. The&#xD; Court adds in a footnote: “One consequence of
    taking&#xD; account of the purpose underlying past actions is that the&#xD; same government
    action may be constitutional if taken in&#xD; the first instance and unconstitutional if it has
    a sectarian&#xD; heritage.” Ante, at 18, n. 14.&#xD; This inconsistency may be explicable in
    theory, but I&#xD; suspect that the “objective observer” with whom the Court&#xD; is so
    concerned will recognize its absurdity in practice. By&#xD; virtue of details familiar only to
    the parties to litigation&#xD; and their lawyers, McCreary and Pulaski Counties, Ken-&#xD;
    tucky, and Rutherford County, Tennessee, have been&#xD; ordered to remove the same display that
    appears in court-&#xD; houses from Mercer County, Kentucky to Elkhart County,&#xD; Indiana.

    (and under the direction of good legal&#xD; advice) are permissible, while those hung after
    discussion&#xD; and debate are deemed unconstitutional. Reduction of the&#xD; Establishment
    Clause to such minutiae trivializes the&#xD; Clause’s protection against religious
    establishment; in-&#xD; deed, it may inflame religious passions by making the&#xD; passing
    comments of every government official the subject&#xD; of endless litigation.&#xD; C&#xD; In any
    event, the Court’s conclusion that the Counties&#xD; exhibited the Foundations Displays with the
    purpose of&#xD; promoting religion is doubtful. In the Court’s view, the&#xD; impermissible
    motive was apparent from the initial dis-&#xD; plays of the Ten Commandments all by themselves:
    When&#xD; that occurs, the Court says, “a religious object is unmis-&#xD; takable.” Ante, at 21.
    Surely that cannot be. If, as dis-&#xD; cussed above, the Commandments have a proper place
    in&#xD; our civic history, even placing them by themselves can be&#xD; civically
    motivated—especially when they are placed, not&#xD; in a school (as they were in the Stone case
    upon which the&#xD; Court places such reliance), but in a courthouse. Cf. Van&#xD; Orden, ante,
    at 4 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment)&#xD; (“The circumstances surrounding the display’s
    placement&#xD; on the capital grounds, and its physical setting suggest&#xD; that the State
    itself intended the . . . nonreligious aspects&#xD; of the tablets’ message to predominate”).
    And the fact that&#xD; at the posting of the exhibit a clergyman was present is&#xD;
    unremarkable (clergymen taking particular pride in the&#xD; role of the Ten Commandments in our
    civic history); and&#xD; even more unremarkable the fact that the clergyman&#xD; “testified to
    the certainty of the existence of God,” ante, at&#xD; 21.&#xD; The Court has in the past
    prohibited government ac-&#xD; 26 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF
    KY.&#xD; SCALIA, J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD; tions that “proselytize or advance any one, or . . .
    dispar-&#xD; age any other, faith or belief,” see Marsh, 463 U. S., at&#xD; 794–795, or that
    apply some level of coercion (though I&#xD; and others have disagreed about the form that
    coercion&#xD; must take), see, e.g., Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S., at 592&#xD; (prayer at
    high-school graduation invalid because of “subtle&#xD; coercive pressure”); id., at 642 (SCALIA,
    J., dissenting). The&#xD; passive display of the Ten Commandments, even standing&#xD; alone,
    does not begin to do either. What JUSTICE&#xD; KENNEDY said of the crèche in Allegheny County is
    equally&#xD; true of the Counties’ original Ten Commandments&#xD; displays:&#xD; “No one was
    compelled to observe or participate in&#xD; any religious ceremony or activity. [T]he
    count[ies]&#xD; [did not] contribut[e] significant amounts of tax&#xD; money to serve the cause
    of one religious faith. [The&#xD; Ten Commandments] are purely passive symbols of&#xD; [the
    religious foundation for many of our laws and&#xD; governmental institutions]. Passersby who
    disagree&#xD; with the message conveyed by th[e] displays are free&#xD; to ignore them, or even
    to turn their backs, just as&#xD; they are free to do when they disagree with any other&#xD;
    form of government speech.” 492 U. S., at 664 (opin-&#xD; ion concurring in judgment in part and
    dissenting in&#xD; part).&#xD; Nor is it the case that a solo display of the Ten Com-&#xD;
    mandments advances any one faith. They are assuredly a&#xD; religious symbol, but they are not
    so closely associated&#xD; with a single religious belief that their display can rea-&#xD;
    sonably be understood as preferring one religious sect over&#xD; another. The Ten Commandments
    are recognized by&#xD; Judaism, Christianity, and Islam alike as divinely given.&#xD; See 13

    &#xD; SCALIA, J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD; The Court also points to the Counties’ second
    displays,&#xD; which featured a number of statements in historical&#xD; documents reflecting a
    religious influence, and the resolu-&#xD; tions that accompanied their erection, as evidence of
    an&#xD; impermissible religious purpose.13 In the Court’s view,&#xD; “[t]he [second] display’s
    unstinting focus . . . on religious&#xD; passages, show[s] that the Counties were posting
    the&#xD; Commandments precisely because of their sectarian con-&#xD; tent.” Ante, at 22. No, all
    it necessarily shows is that the&#xD; &#xD; ——————&#xD; within faiths concerning the meaning and
    perhaps even the text of the&#xD; Commandments, JUSTICE STEVENS maintains that any display of
    the&#xD; text of the Ten Commandments is impermissible because it “invariably&#xD; places the
    [government] at the center of a serious sectarian dispute.”&#xD; Van Orden, ante, at 13
    (dissenting opinion). I think not. The sectarian&#xD; dispute regarding text, if serious, is not
    widely known. I doubt that&#xD; most religious adherents are even aware that there are
    competing&#xD; versions with doctrinal consequences (I certainly was not). In any&#xD; event,
    the context of the display here could not conceivably cause the&#xD; viewer to believe that the
    government was taking sides in a doctrinal&#xD; controversy.&#xD; 13 Posted less than a month
    after respondents filed suit, the second&#xD; &#xD; displays included an excerpt from the
    Declaration of Independence, the&#xD; Preamble to the Kentucky Constitution, a page from the
    Congressional&#xD; Record declaring 1983 to be the Year of the Bible and the proclamation&#xD;
    of President Reagan stating the same, a proclamation of President&#xD; Lincoln designating April
    30, 1863 as a National Day of Prayer and&#xD; Humiliation, an excerpt from Lincoln’s “Reply to
    Loyal Colored People&#xD; of Baltimore upon Presentation of a Bible” stating that “[t]he Bible
    is&#xD; the best gift God has ever given to man,” and the Mayflower Compact.&#xD; <span

    </span>, 684 (ED Ky., 2000). The Counties erected the&#xD; displays in accordance with a
    resolution passed by their legislative&#xD; bodies, authorizing the County-Judge Executives “to
    read or post the&#xD; Ten Commandments as the precedent legal code upon which the civil&#xD; and
    criminal codes of the Commonwealth of Kentucky are founded,”&#xD; and to display alongside the
    Ten Commandments copies of the docu-&#xD; ments listed above “without censorship because of any
    Christian or&#xD; religious references in these writings, documents, and historical re-&#xD;
    cords.” Def. Exh. 1 in Memorandum in Support of Defendants’ Motion&#xD; to Dismiss in Civ. A.
    No. 99–507, p. 1 (ED Ky.) (hereinafter Def. Exh.&#xD; 1).&#xD; 28 MCCREARY COUNTY v. AMERICAN
    CIVIL LIBERTIES&#xD; UNION OF KY.&#xD; SCALIA, J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD; exhibit was meant to
    focus upon the historic role of reli-&#xD; gious belief in our national life—which is entirely
    permis-&#xD; sible. And the same can be said of the resolution. To&#xD; forbid any government
    focus upon this aspect of our his-&#xD; tory is to display what Justice Goldberg called
    “untutored&#xD; devotion to the concept of neutrality,” Abington Township,&#xD; 374 U. S., at
    306 (concurring opinion), that would commit&#xD; the Court (and the Nation) to a revisionist
    agenda of&#xD; secularization.&#xD; Turning at last to the displays actually at issue in
    this&#xD; case, the Court faults the Counties for not repealing the&#xD; resolution expressing
    what the Court believes to be an&#xD; impermissible intent. Under these circumstances, the&#xD;
    Court says, “no reasonable observer could swallow the&#xD; claim that the Counties had cast off
    the objective so un-&#xD; mistakable in the earlier displays.” Ante, at 24. Even&#xD; were I to
    accept all that the Court has said before, I would&#xD; not agree with that assessment. To begin
    with, of course,&#xD; it is unlikely that a reasonable observer would even have&#xD; been aware
    of the resolutions, so there would be nothing to&#xD; “cast off.” The Court implies that the
    Counties may have&#xD; been able to remedy the “taint” from the old resolutions by&#xD; enacting
    a new one. See ante, at 23–24. But that action&#xD; would have been wholly unnecessary in light
    of the expla-&#xD; nation that the Counties included with the displays them-&#xD; selves: A
    plaque next to the documents informed all who&#xD; passed by that each display “contains
    documents that&#xD; played a significant role in the foundation of our system of&#xD; law and
    government.” Additionally, there was no reason&#xD; for the Counties to repeal or repudiate the
    resolutions&#xD; adopted with the hanging of the second displays, since&#xD; they related only
    to the second displays. After complying&#xD; with the District Court’s order to remove the
    second dis-&#xD; plays “immediately,” and erecting new displays that in&#xD; content and by
    express assertion reflected a different&#xD; purpose from that identified in the resolutions,
    the Coun-&#xD; Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005) 29&#xD; &#xD; SCALIA, J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD;
    ties had no reason to believe that their previous resolu-&#xD; tions would be deemed to be the
    basis for their actions.14&#xD; After the Counties discovered that the sentiments ex-&#xD;
    pressed in the resolutions could be attributed to their most&#xD; recent displays (in oral
    argument before this Court), they&#xD; repudiated them immediately.&#xD; In sum: The first
    displays did not necessarily evidence&#xD; an intent to further religious practice; nor did the
    second&#xD; displays, or the resolutions authorizing them; and there is&#xD; in any event no
    basis for attributing whatever intent&#xD; motivated the first and second displays to the
    third.&#xD; Given the presumption of regularity that always accom-&#xD; panies our review of
    official action, see supra, at 18–19&#xD; n. 9, the Court has identified no evidence of a
    purpose to&#xD; advance religion in a way that is inconsistent with our&#xD; cases. The Court
    may well be correct in identifying the&#xD; third displays as the fruit of a desire to display
    the Ten&#xD; Commandments, ante, at 24, but neither our cases nor our&#xD; ——————&#xD; 14
    Contrary to the Court’s suggestion, see ante, at 24, n. 20, it is clear&#xD; that the
    resolutions were closely tied to the second displays, but not to the&#xD; third. Each of the
    documents included in the second displays was author-&#xD; ized by the resolutions, and those
    displays, consistent with the resolutions’&#xD; direction to “post the Ten Commandments as the
    precedent legal code&#xD; upon which the civil and criminal codes of the Commonwealth of
    Ken-&#xD; tucky are founded,” Def. Exh. 1, consisted of a large copy of the Ten&#xD;
    Commandments alongside much smaller framed copies of other historical,&#xD; religious documents.
    The third displays, in contrast, included documents&#xD; not mentioned in the resolutions (the
    Magna Carta and a picture of Lady&#xD; Justice) and did not include documents authorized by the
    resolutions&#xD; (correspondence and proclamations of Abraham Lincoln and the Resolu-&#xD; tion
    of Congress declaring 1983 to be the Year of the Bible).&#xD; The resolutions also provided that
    they were to be posted beside the&#xD; displays that they authorized. Def. Exh. 1, at 9. Yet
    respondents have&#xD; never suggested the resolutions were posted next to the third
    displays,&#xD; and the record before the Court indicates that they were not. The&#xD; photos
    included in the Appendix show that the third displays included&#xD; 10 frames—the nine
    historical documents and the prefatory statement&#xD; explaining the relevance of each of the
    documents. See App. to Pet. for&#xD; Cert. 177a (McCreary County), 178a (Pulaski County).&#xD;
