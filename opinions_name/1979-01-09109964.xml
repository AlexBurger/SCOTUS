      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*324</span> MR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the
         Court.</p>
      <p>This case presents the question whether a party who has had issues of fact adjudicated
         adversely to it in an equitable action may be collaterally estopped from relitigating the
         same issues before a jury in a subsequent legal action brought against it by a new
         party.</p>
      <p>The respondent brought this stockholder's class action against the petitioners in a Federal
         District Court. The complaint alleged that the petitioners, Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc.
         (Parklane), and 13 of its officers, directors, and stockholders, had issued a materially
         false and misleading proxy statement in connection with a merger.<span class="sup"
            >[1]</span> The proxy statement, according to the complaint, had violated §§ 14 (a), 10
         (b), and 20 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 895, 891, 899, as amended,
         15 U. S. C. §§ 78n (a), 78j (b), and 78t (a), as well as various rules and regulations
         promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The complaint sought damages,
         rescission of the merger, and recovery of costs.</p>
      <p>Before this action came to trial, the SEC filed suit against the same defendants in the
         Federal District Court, alleging that the proxy statement that had been issued by Parklane
         was materially false and misleading in essentially the same respects as those that had ben
         alleged in the respondent's complaint. Injunctive relief was requested. After a 4-day <span
            class="star-pagination">*325</span> trial, the District Court found that the proxy
         statement was materially false and misleading in the respects alleged, and entered a
         declaratory judgment to that effect. SEC v. Parklane Hosiery Co., 422 F. Supp. 477. The
         Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed this judgment. 558 F. 2d 1083.</p>
      <p>The respondent in the present case then moved for partial summary judgment against the
         petitioners, asserting that the petitioners were collaterally estopped from relitigating
         the issues that had been resolved against them in the action brought by the SEC.<span
            class="sup">[2]</span> The District Court denied the motion on the ground that such an
         application of collateral estoppel would deny the petitioners their Seventh Amendment right
         to a jury trial. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, holding that a party
         who has had issues of fact determined against him after a full and fair opportunity to
         litigate in a nonjury trial is collaterally estopped from obtaining a subsequent jury trial
         of these same issues of fact. 565 F. 2d 815. The appellate court concluded that "the
         Seventh Amendment preserves the right to jury trial only with respect to issues of fact,
         [and] once those issues have been fully and fairly adjudicated in a prior proceeding,
         nothing remains for trial, either with or without a jury." Id., at 819. Because of an
         intercircuit conflict,<span class="sup">[3]</span> we granted certiorari. 435 U. S.
         1006.</p>

      <h2>
         <span class="star-pagination">*326</span> I</h2>
      <p>The threshold question to be considered is whether, quite apart from the right to a jury
         trial under the Seventh Amendment, the petitioners can be precluded from relitigating facts
         resolved adversely to them in a prior equitable proceeding with another party under the
         general law of collateral estoppel. Specifically, we must determine whether a litigant who
         was not a party to a prior judgment may nevertheless use that judgment "offensively" to
         prevent a defendant from relitigating issues resolved in the earlier proceeding.<span
            class="sup">[4]</span>
      </p>
      <p/>
      <h2>A</h2>
      <p>Collateral estoppel, like the related doctrine of res judicata,<span class="sup">[5]</span>
         has the dual purpose of protecting litigants from the burden of relitigating an identical
         issue with the same party or his privy and of promoting judicial economy by preventing
         needless litigation. Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois
         Foundation, 402 U. S. 313, 328-329. Until relatively recently, however, the scope of
         collateral estoppel was limited by the doctrine of mutuality of parties. Under this
         mutuality doctrine, neither party could use a prior judgment <span class="star-pagination"
            >*327</span> as an estoppel against the other unless both parties were bound by the
            judgment.<span class="sup">[6]</span> Based on the premise that it is somehow unfair to
         allow a party to use a prior judgment when he himself would not be so bound,<span
            class="sup">[7]</span> the mutuality requirement provided a party who had litigated and
         lost in a previous action an opportunity to relitigate identical issues with new
         parties.</p>
      <p>By failing to recognize the obvious difference in position between a party who has never
         litigated an issue and one who has fully litigated and lost, the mutuality requirement was
         criticized almost from its inception.<span class="sup">[8]</span> Recognizing the validity
         of this criticism, the Court in Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois
         Foundation, supra, abandoned the mutuality requirement, at least in cases where a patentee
         seeks to relitigate the validity of a patent after a federal court in a previous lawsuit
         has already declared it invalid.<span class="sup">[9]</span> The <span
            class="star-pagination">*328</span> "broader question" before the Court, however, was
         "whether it is any longer tenable to afford a litigant more than one full and fair
         opportunity for judicial resolution of the same issue." 402 U. S., at 328. The Court
         strongly suggested a negative answer to that question:</p> "In any lawsuit where a
      defendant, because of the mutuality principle, is forced to present a complete defense on the
      merits to a claim which the plaintiff has fully litigated and lost in a prior action, there is
      an arguable misallocation of resources. To the extent the defendant in the second suit may not
      win by asserting, without contradiction, that the plaintiff had fully and fairly, but
      unsuccessfully, litigated the same claim in the prior suit, the defendant's time and money are
      diverted from alternative uses&#x97;productive or otherwise&#x97;to relitigation of a decided
      issue. And, still assuming that the issue was resolved correctly in the first suit, there is
      reason to be concerned about the plaintiff's allocation of resources. Permitting repeated
      litigation of the same issue as long as the supply of unrelated defendants holds out reflects
      either the aura of the gaming table or `a lack of discipline and of disinterestedness on the
      part of the lower courts, hardly a worthy or wise basis for fashioning rules of procedure.'
      Kerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O-Two Co., 342 U. S. 180, 185 (1952). Although neither judges, the
      parties, nor the adversary system performs perfectly in all cases, the requirement of
      determining whether the party against whom an estoppel is asserted had a full and fair
      opportunity to litigate is a most significant safeguard." Id., at 329.<span class="sup"
         >[10]</span>
      <p/>
      <h2>
         <span class="star-pagination">*329</span> B</h2>
      <p>The Blonder-Tongue case involved defensive use of collateral estoppel&#x97;a plaintiff was
         estopped from asserting a claim that the plaintiff had previously litigated and lost
         against another defendant. The present case, by contrast, involves offensive use of
         collateral estoppel&#x97;a plaintiff is seeking to estop a defendant from relitigating the
         issues which the defendant previously litigated and lost against another plaintiff. In both
         the offensive and defensive use situations, the party against whom estoppel is asserted has
         litigated and lost in an earlier action. Nevertheless, several reasons have been advanced
         why the two situations should be treated differently.<span class="sup">[11]</span>
      </p>
      <p>First, offensive use of collateral estoppel does not promote judicial economy in the same
         manner as defensive use does. Defensive use of collateral estoppel precludes a plaintiff
         from relitigating identical issues by merely "switching adversaries." Bernhard v. Bank of
         America Nat. Trust &amp;amp; Savings Assn., 19 Cal. 2d, at 813, 122 P. 2d, at 895.<span
            class="sup">[12]</span> Thus defensive collateral estoppel gives a plaintiff a strong
         incentive to join <span class="star-pagination">*330</span> all potential defendants in the
         first action if possible. Offensive use of collateral estoppel, on the other hand, creates
         precisely the opposite incentive. Since a plaintiff will be able to rely on a previous
         judgment against a defendant but will not be bound by that judgment if the defendant wins,
         the plaintiff has every incentive to adopt a "wait and see" attitude, in the hope that the
         first action by another plaintiff will result in a favorable judgment. E. g., Nevarov v.
         Caldwell, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/calctapp/77Ju/nevarov-v-caldwell/">
               <span class="volume">161</span>
               <span class="reporter">Cal. App. 2d</span>
               <span class="page">762</span>
            </a>
         </span>, 767-768, 327 P. 2d 111, 115; Reardon v. Allen, 88 N. J. Super. 560, 571-572, 213
         A. 2d 26, 32. Thus offensive use of collateral estoppel will likely increase rather than
         decrease the total amount of litigation, since potential plaintiffs will have everything to
         gain and nothing to lose by not intervening in the first action.<span class="sup"
            >[13]</span>
      </p>
      <p>A second argument against offensive use of collateral estoppel is that it may be unfair to
         a defendant. If a defendant in the first action is sued for small or nominal damages, he
         may have little incentive to defend vigorously, particularly if future suits are not
         foreseeable. The Evergreens v. Nunan, 141 F. 2d 927, 929 (CA2); cf. Berner v. British
         Commonwealth Pac. Airlines, 346 F. 2d 532 (CA2) (application of offensive collateral
         estoppel denied where defendant did not appeal an adverse judgment awarding damages of
         $35,000 and defendant was later sued for over $7 million). Allowing offensive collateral
         estoppel may also be unfair to a defendant if the judgment relied upon as a basis for the
         estoppel is itself inconsistent with one or more previous judgments in favor of the
            defendant.<span class="sup">[14]</span> Still another situation where it might be <span
            class="star-pagination">*331</span> unfair to apply offensive estoppel is where the
         second action affords the defendant procedural opportunities unavailable in the first
         action that could readily cause a different result.<span class="sup">[15]</span>
      </p>
      <p/>
      <h2>C</h2>
      <p>We have concluded that the preferable approach for dealing with these problems in the
         federal courts is not to preclude the use of offensive collateral estoppel, but to grant
         trial courts broad discretion to determine when it should be applied.<span class="sup"
            >[16]</span> The general rule should be that in cases where a plaintiff could easily
         have joined in the earlier action or where, either for the reasons discussed above or for
         other reasons, the application of offensive estoppel would be unfair to a defendant, a
         trial judge should not allow the use of offensive collateral estoppel.</p>
      <p>In the present case, however, none of the circumstances that might justify reluctance to
         allow the offensive use of collateral estoppel is present. The application of offensive
         collateral <span class="star-pagination">*332</span> estoppel will not here reward a
         private plaintiff who could have joined in the previous action, since the respondent
         probably could not have joined in the injunctive action brought by the SEC even had he so
            desired.<span class="sup">[17]</span> Similarly, there is no unfairness to the
         petitioners in applying offensive collateral estoppel in this case. First, in light of the
         serious allegations made in the SEC's complaint against the petitioners, as well as the
         foreseeability of subsequent private suits that typically follow a successful Government
         judgment, the petitioners had every incentive to litigate the SEC lawsuit fully and
            vigorously.<span class="sup">[18]</span> Second, the judgment in the SEC action was not
         inconsistent with any previous decision. Finally, there will in the respondent's action be
         no procedural opportunities available to the petitioners that were unavailable in the first
         action of a kind that might be likely to cause a different result.<span class="sup"

      <p>We conclude, therefore, that none of the considerations that would justify a refusal to
         allow the use of offensive collateral estoppel is present in this case. Since the
         petitioners received a "full and fair" opportunity to litigate their claims in the <span
            class="star-pagination">*333</span> SEC action, the contemporary law of collateral
         estoppel leads inescapably to the conclusion that the petitioners are collaterally estopped
         from relitigating the question of whether the proxy statement was materially false and
         misleading.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>II</h2>
      <p>The question that remains is whether, notwithstanding the law of collateral estoppel, the
         use of offensive collateral estoppel in this case would violate the petitioners' Seventh
         Amendment right to a jury trial.<span class="sup">[20]</span>

      </p>
      <p>Recognition that an equitable determination could have collateral-estoppel effect in a
         subsequent legal action was the major premise of this Court's decision in Beacon Theatres,
         Inc. v. Westover, 359 U. S. 500. In that case the plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment
         that certain arrangements between it <span class="star-pagination">*334</span> and the
         defendant were not in violation of the antitrust laws, and asked for an injunction to
         prevent the defendant from instituting an antitrust action to challenge the arrangements.
         The defendant denied the allegations and counter-claimed for treble damages under the
         antitrust laws, requesting a trial by jury of the issues common to both the legal and
         equitable claims. The Court of Appeals upheld denial of the request, but this Court
         reversed, stating:</p> "[T]he effect of the action of the District Court could be, as the
      Court of Appeals believed, `to limit the petitioner's opportunity fully to try to a jury every
      issue which has a bearing upon its treble damage suit,' for determination of the issue of
      clearances by the judge might `operate either by way of res judicata or collateral estoppel so
      as to conclude both parties with respect thereto at the subsequent trial of the treble damage
      claim.' " Id., at 504. <p>It is thus clear that the Court in the Beacon Theatres case thought
         that if an issue common to both legal and equitable claims was first determined by a judge,
         relitigation of the issue before a jury might be foreclosed by res judicata or collateral
         estoppel. To avoid this result, the Court held that when legal and equitable claims are
         joined in the same action, the trial judge has only limited discretion in determining the
         sequence of trial and "that discretion . . . must, wherever possible, be exercised to
         preserve jury trial." Id., at 510.<span class="sup">[22]</span>
      </p>
      <p>Both the premise of Beacon Theatres, and the fact that it enunciated no more than a general
         prudential rule were confirmed by this Court's decision in Katchen v. Landy, 382 U. S. 323.
         In that case the Court held that a bankruptcy court, sitting as a statutory court of
         equity, is empowered to adjudicate <span class="star-pagination">*335</span> equitable
         claims prior to legal claims, even though the factual issues decided in the equity action
         would have been triable by a jury under the Seventh Amendment if the legal claims had been
         adjudicated first. The Court stated:</p> "Both Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen recognize
      that there might be situations in which the Court could proceed to resolve the equitable claim
      first even though the results might be dispositive of the issues involved in the legal claim."
      Id., at 339. <p>Thus the Court in Katchen v. Landy recognized that an equitable determination
         can have collateral-estoppel effect in a subsequent legal action and that this estoppel
         does not violate the Seventh Amendment.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>B</h2>
      <p>Despite the strong support to be found both in history and in the recent decisional law of
         this Court for the proposition that an equitable determination can have collateral-estoppel
         effect in a subsequent legal action, the petitioners argue that application of collateral
         estoppel in this case would nevertheless violate their Seventh Amendment right to a jury
         trial. The petitioners contend that since the scope of the Amendment must be determined by
         reference to the common law as it existed in 1791, and since the common law permitted
         collateral estoppel only where there was mutuality of parties, collateral estoppel cannot
         constitutionally be applied when such mutuality is absent.</p>
      <p>The petitioners have advanced no persuasive reason, however, why the meaning of the Seventh
         Amendment should depend on whether or not mutuality of parties is present. A litigant who
         has lost because of adverse factual findings in an equity action is equally deprived of a
         jury trial whether he is estopped from relitigating the factual issues against the same
         party or a new party. In either case, the party against whom estoppel is asserted has
         litigated questions of fact, and has had the facts determined against him in an earlier
         proceeding. <span class="star-pagination">*336</span> In either case there is no further
         factfinding function for the jury to perform, since the common factual issues have been
         resolved in the previous action. Cf. Ex parte Peterson, 253 U. S. 300, 310 ("No one is
         entitled in a civil case to trial by jury unless and except so far as there are issues of
         fact to be determined").</p>
      <p>The Seventh Amendment has never been interpreted in the rigid manner advocated by the
         petitioners. On the contrary, many procedural devices developed since 1791 that have
         diminished the civil jury's historic domain have been found not to be inconsistent with the
         Seventh Amendment. See Galloway v. United States, 319 U. S. 372, 388-393 (directed verdict
         does not violate the Seventh Amendment); Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refining Co.,
         283 U. S. 494, 497-498 (retrial limited to question of damages does not violate the Seventh
         Amendment even though there was no practice at common law for setting aside a verdict in
         part); Fidelity &amp;amp; Deposit Co. v. United States, 187 U. S. 315, 319-321 (summary
         judgment does not violate the Seventh Amendment).<span class="sup">[23]</span>
      </p>
      <p>The Galloway case is particularly instructive. There the party against whom a directed
         verdict had been entered argued that the procedure was unconstitutional under the Seventh
         Amendment. In rejecting this claim, the Court said:</p> "The Amendment did not bind the
      federal courts to the exact procedural incidents or details of jury trial according <span
         class="star-pagination">*337</span> to the common law in 1791, any more than it tied them
      to the common-law system of pleading or the specific rules of evidence then prevailing. Nor
      were `the rules of the common law' then prevalent, including those relating to the procedure
      by which the judge regulated the jury's role on questions of fact, crystallized in a fixed and
      immutable system. . . . "The more logical conclusion, we think, and the one which both history
      and the previous decisions here support, is that the Amendment was designed to preserve the
      basic institution of jury trial in only its most fundamental elements, not the great mass of
      procedural forms and details, varying even then so widely among common-law jurisdictions." 319
      U. S., at 390, 392 (footnote omitted). <p>The law of collateral estoppel, like the law in
         other procedural areas defining the scope of the jury's function, has evolved since 1791.
         Under the rationale of the Galloway case, these developments are not repugnant to the
         Seventh Amendment simply for the reason that they did not exist in 1791. Thus if, as we
         have held, the law of collateral estoppel forecloses the petitioners from relitigating the
         factual issues determined against them in the SEC action, nothing in the Seventh Amendment
         dictates a different result, even though because of lack of mutuality there would have been
         no collateral estoppel in 1791.<span class="sup">[24]</span>
      </p>
      <p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>
      <p>Affirmed.</p>
      <p>MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting.</p>
      <p>It is admittedly difficult to be outraged about the treatment accorded by the federal
         judiciary to petitioners' demand for a jury trial in this lawsuit. Outrage is an emotion
         all but <span class="star-pagination">*338</span> impossible to generate with respect to a
         corporate defendant in a securities fraud action, and this case is no exception. But the
         nagging sense of unfairness as to the way petitioners have been treated, engendered by the
         imprimatur placed by the Court of Appeals on respondent's "heads I win, tails you lose"
         theory of this litigation, is not dispelled by this Court's antiseptic analysis of the
         issues in the case. It may be that if this Nation were to adopt a new Constitution today,
         the Seventh Amendment guaranteeing the right of jury trial in civil cases in federal courts
         would not be included among its provisions. But any present sentiment to that effect cannot
         obscure or dilute our obligation to enforce the Seventh Amendment, which was included in
         the Bill of Rights in 1791 and which has not since been repealed in the only manner
         provided by the Constitution for repeal of its provisions.</p>
      <p>The right of trial by jury in civil cases at common law is fundamental to our history and
         jurisprudence. Today, however, the Court reduces this valued right, which Blackstone
         praised as "the glory of the English law," to a mere "neutral" <span
            class="star-pagination">*339</span> factor and in the name of procedural reform denies
         the right of jury trial to defendants in a vast number of cases in which defendants,
         heretofore, have enjoyed jury trials. Over 35 years ago, Mr. Justice Black lamented the
         "gradual process of judicial erosion which in one-hundred-fifty years has slowly worn away
         a major portion of the essential guarantee of the Seventh Amendment." Galloway v. United
         States, 319 U. S. 372, 397 (1943) (dissenting opinion). Regrettably, the erosive process
         continues apace with today's decision.<span class="sup">[1]</span>
      </p>
      <p/>
      <h2>I</h2>
      <p>The Seventh Amendment provides:</p> "In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy
      shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried
      by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to
      the rules of the common law." <p>The history of the Seventh Amendment has been amply
         documented by this Court and by legal scholars,<span class="sup">[2]</span> and it would
         serve no useful purpose to attempt here to repeat all that has been written on the subject.
         Nonetheless, the decision of this case turns on the scope and effect of the Seventh
         Amendment, which, perhaps more than with any other provision of the Constitution, are
         determined by reference to the historical <span class="star-pagination">*340</span> setting
         in which the Amendment was adopted. See Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U. S. 149, 152 (1973). It
         therefore is appropriate to pause to review, albeit briefly, the circumstances preceding
         and attending the adoption of the Seventh Amendment as a guide in ascertaining its
         application to the case at hand.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>A</h2>
      <p>It is perhaps easy to forget, now more than 200 years removed from the events, that the
         right of trial by jury was held in such esteem by the colonists that its deprivation at the
         hands of the English was one of the important grievances leading to the break with England.
         See Sources and Documents Illustrating the American Revolution 1764-1788 and the Formation
         of the Federal Constitution 94 (S. Morison 2d ed. 1929); R. Pound, The Development of
         Constitutional Guarantees of Liberty 69-72 (1957); C. Ubbelohde, The Vice-Admiralty Courts
         and the American Revolution 208-211 (1960). The extensive use of vice-admiralty courts by
         colonial administrators to eliminate the colonists' right of jury trial was listed among
         the specific offensive English acts denounced in the Declaration of Independence.<span
            class="sup">[3]</span> And after <span class="star-pagination">*341</span> war had
         broken out, all of the 13 newly formed States restored the institution of civil jury trial
         to its prior prominence; 10 expressly guaranteed the right in their state constitutions and
         the 3 others recognized it by statute or by common practice.<span class="sup">[4]</span>
         Indeed, "[t]he right to trial by jury was probably the only one universally secured by the
         first American state constitutions . . . ." L. Levy, Legacy of Suppression: Freedom of
         Speech and Press in Early American History 281 (1960).<span class="sup">[5]</span>
      </p>
      <p>One might justly wonder then why no mention of the right of jury trial in civil cases
         should have found its way into the Constitution that emerged from the Philadelphia
         Convention in 1787. Article III, § 2, cl. 3, merely provides that "The Trial of all Crimes,
         except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury." The omission of a clause protective of
         the civil jury right was not for lack of trying, however. Messrs. Pinckney and Gerry
         proposed to provide a clause securing the right of jury trial in civil cases, but their
         efforts failed.<span class="sup">[6]</span> Several reasons <span class="star-pagination"
            >*342</span> have been advanced for this failure. The Federalists argued that the
         practice of civil juries among the several States varied so much that it was too difficult
         to draft constitutional language to accommodate the different state practices. See Colgrove
         v. Battin, supra, at 153.<span class="sup">[7]</span> Whatever the reason for the omission,
         however, it is clear that even before the delegates had left Philadelphia, plans were under
         way to attack the proposed Constitution on the ground that it failed to contain a guarantee
         of civil jury trial in the new federal courts. See R. Rutland, George Mason 91 (1961);
         Wolfram 662.</p>
      <p>The virtually complete absence of a bill of rights in the proposed Constitution was the
         principal focus of the Anti-Federalists' attack on the Constitution, and the lack of a
         provision for civil juries featured prominently in their arguments. See Parsons v. Bedford,
            <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/rtj/parsons-v-bedford/">
               <span class="volume">3</span>
               <span class="reporter">Pet.</span>
               <span class="page">433</span>
            </a>
         </span>, 445 (1830). Their pleas struck a responsive chord in the populace, and the price
         exacted in many States for approval of the Constitution was the appending of a list of
         recommended amendments, chief among them a clause securing the right of jury trial in civil
            cases.<span class="sup">[8]</span> Responding to the pressures for a civil jury <span
            class="star-pagination">*343</span> guarantee generated during the ratification debates,
         the first Congress under the new Constitution at its first session in 1789 proposed to
         amend the Constitution by adding the following language: "In suits at common law, between
         man and man, the trial by jury, as one of the best securities to the rights of the people,
         ought to remain inviolate." 1 Annals of Cong. 435 (1789). That provision, altered in
         language to what became the Seventh Amendment, was proposed by the Congress in 1789 to the
         legislatures of the several States and became effective with its ratification by Virginia
         on December 15, 1791.<span class="sup">[9]</span>
      </p>
      <p>The foregoing sketch is meant to suggest what many of those who oppose the use of juries in
         civil trials seem to ignore. The founders of our Nation considered the right of trial by
         jury in civil cases an important bulwark against tyranny and corruption, a safeguard too
         precious to be left to the whim of the sovereign, or, it might be added, to that of the
            judiciary.<span class="sup">[10]</span> Those who passionately advocated the right to a
         civil jury trial did not do so because they considered the jury a familiar procedural
         device that should be continued; the concerns for the institution of jury trial that led to
         the passages of the Declaration of Independence and to the Seventh Amendment were not
         animated by a belief that use of juries would lead to more efficient judicial
         administration. Trial by a jury of laymen rather than by the sovereign's judges <span
            class="star-pagination">*344</span> was important to the founders because juries
         represent the layman's common sense, the "passional elements in our nature," and thus keep
         the administration of law in accord with the wishes and feelings of the community. O.
         Holmes, Collected Legal Papers 237 (1920). Those who favored juries believed that a jury
         would reach a result that a judge either could not or would not reach.<span class="sup"
            >[11]</span> It is with these values that underlie the Seventh Amendment in mind that
         the Court should, but obviously does not, approach the decision of this case.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>B</h2>
      <p>The Seventh Amendment requires that the right of trial by jury be "preserved." Because the
         Seventh Amendment demands preservation of the jury trial right, our cases have uniformly
         held that the content of the right must be judged by historical standards. E. g., Curtis v.
         Loether, 415 U. S. 189, 193 (1974); Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U. S., at 155-156; Ross v.
         Bernhard, 396 U. S. 531, 533 (1970); Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U. S. 1,8-9 (1899);
         Parsons v. Bedford, supra, at 446. Thus, in Baltimore &amp;amp; Carolina Line v. Redman,
         295 U. S. 654, 657 (1935), the Court stated that "[t]he right of trial by jury thus
         preserved is the right which existed under the English common law when the Amendment was
         adopted." <span class="star-pagination">*345</span> And in Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S.
         474, 476 (1935), the Court held: "In order to ascertain the scope and meaning of the
         Seventh Amendment, resort must be had to the appropriate rules of the common law
         established at the time of the adoption of that constitutional provision in 1791."<span
            class="sup">[12]</span> If a jury would have been impaneled in a particular kind of case
         in 1791, then the Seventh Amendment requires a jury trial today, if either party so
         desires.</p>
      <p>To be sure, it is the substance of the right of jury trial that is preserved, not the
         incidental or collateral effects of common-law practice in 1791. Walker v. New Mexico
         &amp;amp; S. P. R. Co., 165 U. S. 593, 596 (1897). "The aim of the Amendment, as this Court
         has held, is to preserve the substance of the common-law right of trial by jury, as
         distinguished from mere matters of form or procedure, and particularly to retain the
         common-law distinction between the province of the court and that of the jury. . . ."
         Baltimore &amp;amp; Carolina Line v. Redman, supra, at 657. Accord, Colgrove v. Battin,
         supra, at 156-157; Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refining Co., 283 U. S. 494, 498
         (1931); Ex parte Peterson, 253 U. S. 300, 309 (1920). "The Amendment did not bind the
         federal courts to the exact procedural incidents or details of jury trial according to the
         common law of 1791, any more than it tied them to the common-law system of pleading or the
         specific rules of evidence then prevailing." Galloway v. United States, 319 U. S., at
         390.</p>
      <p>To say that the Seventh Amendment does not tie federal courts to the exact procedure of the
         common law in 1791 does <span class="star-pagination">*346</span> not imply, however, that
         any nominally "procedural" change can be implemented, regardless of its impact on the
         functions of the jury. For to sanction creation of procedural devices which limit the
         province of the jury to a greater degree than permitted at common law in 1791 is in direct
         contravention of the Seventh Amendment. See Neely v. Martin K. Eby Constr. Co., 386 U. S.
         317, 322 (1967); Galloway v. United States, supra, at 395; Dimick v. Schiedt, supra, at
         487; Ex parte Peterson, supra, at 309-310. And since we deal here not with the common law
         qua common law but with the Constitution, no amount of argument that the device provides
         for more efficiency or more accuracy or is fairer will save it if the degree of invasion of
         the jury's province is greater than allowed in 1791. To rule otherwise would effectively
         permit judicial repeal of the Seventh Amendment because nearly any change in the province
         of the jury, no matter how drastic the diminution of its functions, can always be
         denominated "procedural reform."</p>
      <p>The guarantees of the Seventh Amendment will prove burdensome in some instances; the civil
         jury surely was a burden to the English governors who, in its stead, substituted the
         vice-admiralty court. But, as with other provisions of the Bill of Rights, the onerous
         nature of the protection is no license for contracting the rights secured by the Amendment.
         Because " `[m]aintenance of the jury as a fact-finding body is of such importance and
         occupies so firm a place in our history and jurisprudence . . . any seeming curtailment of
         the right to a jury trial should be scrutinized with the utmost care.' " Dimick v. Schiedt,
         supra, at 486, quoted in Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U. S. 500, 501 (1959).</p>

      <h2>C</h2>
      <p>Judged by the foregoing principles, I think it is clear that petitioners were denied their
         Seventh Amendment right to a <span class="star-pagination">*347</span> jury trial in this
         case. Neither respondent nor the Court doubts that at common law as it existed in 1791,
         petitioners would have been entitled in the private action to have a jury determine whether
         the proxy statement was false and misleading in the respects alleged. The reason is that at
         common law in 1791, collateral estoppel was permitted only where the parties in the first
         action were identical to, or in privity with, the parties to the subsequent action.<span
            class="sup">[13]</span> It was not until 1971 that the doctrine of mutuality was
         abrogated by this Court in certain limited circumstances. Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc.
         v. University of Illinois Foundation, 402 U. S. 313.<span class="sup">[14]</span> But
         developments in the judge-made doctrine of collateral estoppel, however salutary, cannot,
         consistent with the Seventh Amendment, contract in any material fashion the right to a jury
         trial that a defendant would have enjoyed in 1791. In the instant case, resort to the
         doctrine of collateral estoppel does more than merely contract the right to a jury trial:
         It eliminates the right entirely and therefore contravenes the Seventh Amendment.</p>
      <p>The Court responds, however, that at common law "a litigant was not entitled to have a jury
         [in a subsequent action at law between the same parties] determine issues that had been
         previously adjudicated by a chancellor in equity," and that "petitioners have advanced no
         persuasive reason . . . why the meaning of the Seventh Amendment should depend on <span
            class="star-pagination">*348</span> whether or not mutuality of parties is present."
         Ante, at 333, 335. But that is tantamount to saying that since a party would not be
         entitled to a jury trial if he brought an equitable action, there is no persuasive reason
         why he should receive a jury trial on virtually the same issues if instead he chooses to
         bring his lawsuit in the nature of a legal action. The persuasive reason is that the
         Seventh Amendment requires that a party's right to jury trial which existed at common law
         be "preserved" from incursions by the government or the judiciary. Whether this Court
         believes that use of a jury trial in a particular instance is necessary, or fair or
         repetitive is simply irrelevant. If that view is "rigid," it is the Constitution which
         commands that rigidity. To hold otherwise is to rewrite the Seventh Amendment so that a
         party is guaranteed a jury trial in civil cases unless this Court thinks that a jury trial
         would be inappropriate.</p>
      <p>No doubt parallel "procedural reforms" could be instituted in the area of criminal
         jurisprudence, which would accomplish much the same sort of expedition of court calendars
         and conservation of judicial resources as would the extension of collateral estoppel in
         civil litigation. Government motions for summary judgment, or for a directed verdict in
         favor of the prosecution at the close of the evidence, would presumably save countless
         hours of judges' and jurors' time. It can scarcely be doubted, though, that such
         "procedural reforms" would not survive constitutional scrutiny under the jury trial
         guarantee of the Sixth Amendment. Just as the principle of separation of powers was not
         incorporated by the Framers into the Constitution in order to promote efficiency or
         dispatch in the business of government, the right to a jury trial was not guaranteed in
         order to facilitate prompt and accurate decision of lawsuits. The essence of that right
         lies in its insistence that a body of laymen not permanently attached to the sovereign
         participate along with the judge in the factfinding <span class="star-pagination"
            >*349</span> necessitated by a lawsuit. And that essence is as much a part of the
         Seventh Amendment's guarantee in civil cases as it is of the Sixth Amendment's guarantee in
         criminal prosecutions. Cf. Thiel v. Southern Pacific Co., 328 U. S. 217, 220 (1946).</p>
      <p>Relying on Galloway v. United States, Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refining Co., and
         Fidelity &amp;amp; Deposit Co. v. United States, 187 U. S. 315 (1902), the Court seems to
         suggest that the offensive use of collateral estoppel in this case is permissible under the
         limited principle set forth above that a mere procedural change that does not invade the
         province of the jury and a defendant's right thereto to a greater extent than authorized by
         the common law is permissible. But the Court's actions today constitute a far greater
         infringement of the defendant's rights than it ever before has sanctioned. In Galloway, the
         Court upheld the modern form of directed verdict against a Seventh Amendment challenge, but
         it is clear that a similar form of directed verdict existed at common law in 1791. E. g.,
         Beauchamp v. Borret, Peake 148, 170 Eng. Rep. 110 (N. P. 1792); Coupey v. Henley, 2 Esp.
         540, 542, 170 Eng. Rep. 448, 449 (C. P. 1797).<span class="sup">[15]</span> The modern form
         did not materially alter the function of the jury. Similarly, the modern device of summary
         judgment was found not to violate the Seventh Amendment because in 1791 a demurrer to the
         evidence, a procedural device substantially similar to summary judgment, was a common
         practice. E. g., Pawling v. United States, 4 Cranch 219, 221-222 (1808).<span class="sup"
            >[16]</span>
         <span class="star-pagination">*350</span> The procedural devices of summary judgment and
         directed verdict are direct descendants of their common-law antecedents. They accomplish
         nothing more than could have been done at common law, albeit by a more cumbersome
         procedure. See also Montgomery Ward &amp;amp; Co. v. Duncan, 311 U. S. 243, 250 (1940). And
         while at common law there apparently was no practice of setting aside a verdict in
            part,<span class="sup">[17]</span> the Court in Gasoline Products permitted a partial
         retrial of "distinct and separable" issues because the change in procedure would not impair
         the substance of the right to jury trial. 283 U. S., at 498. The parties in Gasoline
         Products still enjoyed the right to have a jury determine all issues of fact.</p>
      <p>By contrast, the development of nonmutual estoppel is a substantial departure from the
         common law and its use in this case completely deprives petitioners of their right to have
         a jury determine contested issues of fact. I am simply unwilling to accept the Court's
         presumption that the complete extinguishment of petitioners' right to trial by jury can be
         justified as a mere change in "procedural incident or detail." Over 40 years ago, Mr.
         Justice Sutherland observed in a not dissimilar case: "[T]his court in a very special sense
         is charged with the duty of construing and upholding the Constitution; and in the discharge
         of that important duty, it ever must be alert to see that a doubtful precedent be not
         extended by mere analogy to a different case if the result will be to weaken or subvert
         what it conceives to be a principle of the fundamental law of the land." Dimick v. Schiedt,
         293 U. S., at 485.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>
         <span class="star-pagination">*351</span> II</h2>
      <p>Even accepting, arguendo, the majority's position that there is no violation of the Seventh
         Amendment here, I nonetheless would not sanction the use of collateral estoppel in this
         case. The Court today holds:</p> "The general rule should be that in cases where a
      plaintiff could easily have joined in the earlier action or where, either for the reasons
      discussed above or for other reasons, the application of offensive estoppel would be unfair to
      a defendant, a trial judge should not allow the use of offensive collateral estoppel." Ante,
      at 331. <p>In my view, it is "unfair" to apply offensive collateral estoppel where the party
         who is sought to be estopped has not had an opportunity to have the facts of his case
         determined by a jury. Since in this case petitioners were not entitled to a jury trial in
         the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit,<span class="sup">[18]</span> I would
         not estop them from relitigating the issues determined in the SEC suit before a jury in the
         private action. I believe that several factors militate in favor of this result.</p>
      <p>First, the use of offensive collateral estoppel in this case runs counter to the strong
         federal policy favoring jury trials, even if it does not, as the majority holds, violate
         the Seventh Amendment. The Court's decision in Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U. S.
         500 (1959), exemplifies that policy. In Beacon Theatres the Court held that where both
         equitable and legal claims or defenses are presented in a single case, "only under the most
         imperative circumstances, circumstances which in view of the flexible procedures of the
         Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate, can the right to a jury trial of legal issues be
         lost through prior determination of equitable claims." <span class="star-pagination"
            >*352</span> Id., at 510-511.<span class="sup">[19]</span> And in Jacob v. New York, 315
         U. S. 752, 752-753 (1942), the Court stated: "The right of jury trial in civil cases at
         common law is a basic and fundamental feature of our system of federal jurisprudence which
         is protected by the Seventh Amendment. A right so fundamental and sacred to the citizen,
         whether guaranteed by the Constitution or provided by statute, should be jealously guarded
         by the courts." Accord, Simler v. Conner, 372 U. S. 221, 222 (1963); Byrd v. Blue Ridge
         Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc., 356 U. S. 525, 537-539 (1958) (strong federal policy in
         favor of juries requires jury trials in diversity cases, regardless of state practice).
         Today's decision will mean that in a large number of private cases defendants will no
         longer enjoy the right to jury trial.<span class="sup">[20]</span> Neither the Court nor
         respondent has adverted or cited to any unmanageable problems that have resulted <span
            class="star-pagination">*353</span> from according defendants jury trials in such cases.
         I simply see no "imperative circumstances" requiring this wholesale abrogation of jury
            trials.<span class="sup">[21]</span>
      </p>
      <p>Second, I believe that the opportunity for a jury trial in the second action could easily
         lead to a different result from that obtained in the first action before the court and
         therefore that it is unfair to estop petitioners from relitigating the issues before a
         jury. This is the position adopted in the Restatement (Second) of Judgments, which
         disapproves of the application of offensive collateral estoppel where the defendant has an
         opportunity for a jury trial in the second lawsuit that was not available in the first
            action.<span class="sup">[22]</span> The Court accepts the proposition that it is unfair
         to apply offensive collateral estoppel "where the second action affords the defendant
         procedural opportunities unavailable in the first action that could readily cause a
         different result." Ante, at 331. Differences in discovery opportunities between the two
         actions are cited as examples of situations where it would be unfair to permit offensive
         collateral estoppel. Ante, at 331 n. 15. But in the Court's view, the fact that petitioners
         would have been entitled to a jury trial in the present action is not such a "procedural
         opportunit[y]" because "the presence or absence of a jury as factfinder is basically
         neutral, quite unlike, for example, the <span class="star-pagination">*354</span> necessity
         of defending the first lawsuit in an inconvenient forum." Ante, at 332 n. 19 (emphasis
         added).</p>
      <p>As is evident from the prior brief discussion of the development of the civil jury trial
         guarantee in this country, those who drafted the Declaration of Independence and debated so
         passionately the proposed Constitution during the ratification period, would indeed be
         astounded to learn that the presence or absence of a jury is merely "neutral," whereas the
         availability of discovery, a device unmentioned in the Constitution, may be controlling. It
         is precisely because the Framers believed that they might receive a different result at the
         hands of a jury of their peers than at the mercy of the sovereign's judges, that the
         Seventh Amendment was adopted. And I suspect that anyone who litigates cases before juries
         in the 1970's would be equally amazed to hear of the supposed lack of distinction between
         trial by court and trial by jury. The Court can cite no authority in support of this
         curious proposition. The merits of civil juries have been long debated, but I suspect that
         juries have never been accused of being merely "neutral" factors.<span class="sup"
            >[23]</span>
      </p>
      <p>Contrary to the majority's supposition, juries can make a difference, and our cases have,
         before today at least, recognized this obvious fact. Thus, in Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U.
         S., at 157, we stated that "the purpose of the jury trial in . . . civil cases [is] to
         assure a fair and equitable resolution of factual issues, Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin
         Co., 283 U. S. 494, 498 (1931) . . . ." And in Byrd v. Blue Ridge <span
            class="star-pagination">*355</span> Rural Electrical Cooperative, supra, at 537, the
         Court conceded that "the nature of the tribunal which tries issues may be important in the
         enforcement of the parcel of rights making up a cause of action or defense . . . . It may
         well be that in the instant personal-injury case the outcome would be substantially
         affected by whether the issue of immunity is decided by a judge or a jury." See Curtis v.
         Loether, 415 U. S., at 198; cf. Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 156 (1968). Jurors
         bring to a case their common sense and community values; their "very inexperience is an
         asset because it secures a fresh perception of each trial, avoiding the stereotypes said to
         infect the judicial eye." H. Kalven &amp;amp; H. Zeisel, The American Jury 8 (1966).</p>
      <p>The ultimate irony of today's decision is that its potential for significantly conserving
         the resources of either the litigants or the judiciary is doubtful at best. That being the
         case, I see absolutely no reason to frustrate so cavalierly the important federal policy
         favoring jury decisions of disputed fact questions. The instant case is an apt example of
         the minimal savings that will be accomplished by the Court's decision. As the Court admits,
         even if petitioners are collaterally estopped from relitigating whether the proxy was
         materially false and misleading, they are still entitled to have a jury determine whether
         respondent was injured by the alleged misstatements and the amount of damages, if any,
         sustained by respondent. Ante, at 325 n. 2. Thus, a jury must be impaneled in this case in
         any event. The time saved by not trying the issue of whether the proxy was materially false
         and misleading before the jury is likely to be insubstantial.<span class="sup">[24]</span>
         It is just as probable that today's decision will have the result of coercing defendants to
         agree to consent orders or settlements <span class="star-pagination">*356</span> in agency
         enforcement actions in order to preserve their right to jury trial in the private actions.
         In that event, the Court, for no compelling reason, will have simply added a powerful club
         to the administrative agencies' arsenals that even Congress was unwilling to provide
         them.</p>
      <div type="notes">
      <p>[*] Solicitor General McCree, Deputy Solicitor General Easterbrook, Stephen M. Shapiro,
         Harvey L. Pitt, Paul Gonson, and Michael K. Wolensky filed a brief for the United States et
         al. as amici curiae urging affirmance.</p>
      <p>[1] The amended complaint alleged that the proxy statement that had been issued to the
         stockholders was false and misleading because it failed to disclose: (1) that the president
         of Parklane would financially benefit as a result of the company's going private; (2)
         certain ongoing negotiations that could have resulted in financial benefit to Parklane; and
         (3) that the appraisal of the fair value of Parklane stock was based on insufficient
         information to be accurate.</p>
      <p>[2] A private plaintiff in an action under the proxy rules is not entitled to relief simply
         by demonstrating that the proxy solicitation was materially false and misleading. The
         plaintiff must also show that he was injured and prove damages. Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite
         Co., 396 U. S. 375, 386-390. Since the SEC action was limited to a determination of whether
         the proxy statement contained materially false and misleading information, the respondent
         conceded that he would still have to prove these other elements of his prima facie case in
         the private action. The petitioners' right to a jury trial on those remaining issues is not
         contested.</p>
      <p>[3] The position of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is in conflict with that
         taken by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Rachal v. Hill, 435 F. 2d 59.</p>
      <p>[4] In this context, offensive use of collateral estoppel occurs when the plaintiff seeks
         to foreclose the defendant from litigating an issue the defendant has previously litigated
         unsuccessfully in an action with another party. Defensive use occurs when a defendant seeks
         to prevent a plaintiff from asserting a claim the plaintiff has previously litigated and
         lost against another defendant.</p>
      <p>[5] Under the doctrine of res judicata, a judgment on the merits in a prior suit bars a
         second suit involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action.
         Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, on the other hand, the second action is upon a
         different cause of action and the judgment in the prior suit precludes relitigation of
         issues actually litigated and necessary to the outcome of the first action. 1B J. Moore,
         Federal Practice ¶ 0.405 [1], pp. 622-624 (2d ed. 1974); e. g., Lawlor v. National Screen
         Serv. Corp., 349 U. S. 322, 326; Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U. S. 591, 597; Cromwell v.
         County of Sac, 94 U. S. 351, 352-353.</p>
      <p>[6] E. g., Bigelow v. Old Dominion Copper Co., 225 U. S. 111, 127 ("It is a principle of
         general elementary law that estoppel of a judgment must be mutual"); Buckeye Powder Co. v.
         E. I. DuPont de Nemours Powder Co., 248 U. S. 55, 63; Restatement of Judgments § 93
         (1942).</p>
      <p>[7] It is a violation of due process for a judgment to be binding on a litigant who was not
         a party or a privy and therefore has never has an opportunity to be heard. Blonder-Tongue

         </span>, 812, 122 P. 2d 892, 895, made the point succinctly: </p>
      <p>"No satisfactory rationalization has been advanced for the requirement of mutuality. Just
         why a party who was not bound by a previous action should be precluded from asserting it as
         res judicata against a party who was bound by it is difficult to comprehend."</p>
      <p>[9] In Triplett v. Lowell, 297 U. S. 638, the Court had held that a determination of patent
         invalidity in a prior action did not bar a plaintiff from relitigating the validity of a
         patent in a subsequent action against a different defendant. This holding of the Triplett
         case was explicitly over-ruled in the Blonder-Tongue case.</p>
      <p>[10] The Court also emphasized that relitigation of issues previously adjudicated is
         particularly wasteful in patent cases because of their staggering expense and typical
         length. 402 U. S., at 334, 348. Under the doctrine of mutuality of parties an alleged
         infringer might find it cheaper to pay royalties than to challenge a patent that had been
         declared invalid in a prior suit, since the holder of the patent is entitled to a statutory
         presumption of validity. Id., at 338.</p>
      <p>[11] Various commentators have expressed reservations regarding the application of
         offensive collateral estoppel. Currie, Mutuality of Estoppel: Limits of the Bernhard
         Doctrine, 9 Stan. L. Rev. 281 (1957); Semmel, Collateral Estoppel, Mutuality and Joinder of
         Parties, 68 Colum. L. Rev. 1457 (1968); Note, The Impacts of Defensive and Offensive
         Assertion of Collateral Estoppel by a Nonparty, 35 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1010 (1967).
         Professor Currie later tempered his reservations. Civil Procedure: The Tempest Brews, 53
         Calif. L. Rev. 25 (1965).</p>
      <p>[12] Under the mutuality requirement, a plaintiff could accomplish this result since he
         would not have been bound by the judgment had the original defendant won.</p>
      <p>[13] The Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 88 (3) (Tent. Draft No. 2, Apr. 15, 1975)
         provides that application of collateral estoppel may be denied if the party asserting it
         "could have effected joinder in the first action between himself and his present
         adversary."</p>
      <p>[14] In Professor Currie's familiar example, a railroad collision injures 50 passengers all
         of whom bring separate actions against the railroad. After the railroad wins the first 25
         suits, a plaintiff wins in suit 26. Professor Currie argues that offensive use of
         collateral estoppel should not be applied so as to allow plaintiffs 27 through 50
         automatically to recover. Currie, supra, 9 Stan. L. Rev., at 304. See Restatement (Second)
         of Judgments § 88 (4), supra.</p>
      <p>[15] If, for example, the defendant in the first action was forced to defend in an
         inconvenient forum and therefore was unable to engage in full scale discovery or call
         witnesses, application of offensive collateral estoppel may be unwarranted. Indeed,
         differences in available procedures may sometimes justify not allowing a prior judgment to
         have estoppel effect in a subsequent action even between the same parties, or where
         defensive estoppel is asserted against a plaintiff who has litigated and lost. The problem
         of unfairness is particularly acute in cases of offensive estoppel, however, because the
         defendant against whom estoppel is asserted typically will not have chosen the forum in the
         first action. See, id., § 88 (2) and Comment d.</p>
      <p>[16] This is essentially the approach of id., § 88, which recognizes that "the distinct
         trend if not the clear weight of recent authority is to the effect that there is no
         intrinsic difference between `offensive' as distinct from `defensive' issue preclusion,
         although a stronger showing that the prior opportunity to litigate was adequate may be
         required in the former situation than the latter." Id., Reporter's Note, at 99.</p>
      <p>[17] SEC v. Everest Management Corp., 475 F. 2d 1236, 1240 (CA2) ("[T]he complicating
         effect of the additional issues and the additional parties outweighs any advantage of a
         single disposition of the common issues"). Moreover, consolidation of a private action with
         one brought by the SEC without its consent is prohibited by statute. 15 U. S. C. § 78u
         (g).</p>
      <p>[18] After a 4-day trial in which the petitioners had every opportunity to present evidence
         and call witnesses, the District Court held for the SEC. The petitioners then appealed to
         the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which affirmed the judgment against them.
         Moreover, the petitioners were already aware of the action brought by the respondent, since
         it had commenced before the filing of the SEC action.</p>
      <p>[19] It is true, of course, that the petitioners in the present action would be entitled to
         a jury trial of the issues bearing on whether the proxy statement was materially false and
         misleading had the SEC action never been brought&#x97;a matter to be discussed in Part II
         of this opinion. But the presence or absence of a jury as factfinder is basically neutral,
         quite unlike, for example, the necessity of defending the first lawsuit in an inconvenient
         forum.</p>
      <p>[20] The Seventh Amendment provides: "In Suits at common law, where the value in
         controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right to jury trial shall be preserved. . .
         ."</p>
      <p>[21] The authors of this article conclude that the historical sources "indicates that in
         the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, determinations in equity were thought
         to have as much force as determinations at law, and that the possible impact on jury trial
         rights was not viewed with concern. . . . If collateral estoppel is otherwise warranted,
         the jury trial question should not stand in the way." 85 Harv. L. Rev., at 455-456. This
         common-law rule is adopted in the Restatement of Judgments § 68, Comment j (1942).</p>
      <p>[22] Similarly, in both Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 U. S. 469, and Meeker v. Ambassador
         Oil Corp., 375 U. S. 160, the court held that legal claims should ordinarily be tried
         before equitable claims to preserve the right to a jury trial.</p>
      <p>[23] The petitioners' reliance on Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474, is misplaced. In the
         Dimick case the Court held that an increase by the trial judge of the amount of money
         damages awarded by the jury violated the second clause of the Seventh Amendment, which
         provides that "no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the
         United States, than according to the rules of the common law." Collateral estoppel does not
         involve the "re-examination" of any fact decided by a jury. On the contrary, the whole
         premise of collateral estoppel is that once an issue has been resolved in a prior
         proceeding, there is no further factfinding function to be performed.</p>
      <p>[24] In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals went on to state: </p>
      <p>"Were there any doubt about the [question whether the petitioners were entitled to a jury
         redetermination of the issues otherwise subject to collateral estoppel] it should in any
         event be resolved against the defendants in this case for the reason that, although they
         were fully aware of the pendency of the present suit throughout the non-jury trial of the
         SEC case, they made no effort to protect their right to a jury trial of the damage claims
         asserted by plaintiffs, either by seeking to expedite trial of the present action or by
         requesting Judge Duffy, in the exercise of his discretion pursuant to Rule 39 (b), (c),
         F.R.Civ.P., to order that the issues in the SEC case be tried by a jury or before an
         advisory jury." 565 F. 2d, at 821-822. (Footnote omitted.)</p>
      <p>The Court of Appeals was mistaken in these suggestions. The petitioners did not have a
         right to a jury trial in the equitable injunctive action brought by the SEC. Moreover, an
         advisory jury, which might have only delayed and complicated that proceeding, would not in
         any event have been a Seventh Amendment jury. And the petitioners were not in a position to
         expedite the private action and stay the SEC action. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934
         provides for prompt enforcement actions by the SEC unhindered by parallel private actions.
         15 U. S. C. § 78u (g).</p>
      <p>[1] Because I believe that the use of offensive collateral estoppel in this particular case
         was improper, it is not necessary for me to decide whether I would approve its use in
         circumstances where the defendant's right to a jury trial was not impaired.</p>

      <p>[3] The Declaration of Independence states: "For depriving us in many cases, of the
         benefits of Trial by Jury." Just two years earlier, in the Declaration of Rights adopted
         October 14, 1774, the first Continental Congress had unanimously resolved that "the
         respective colonies are entitled to the common law of England, and more especially to the
         great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage, according to
         the course of that law." 1 Journals of the Continental Congress 69 (1904). </p>
      <p>Holdsworth has written that of all the new methods adopted to strengthen the administration
         of the British laws, "the most effective, and therefore the most disliked, was the
         extension given to the jurisdiction of the reorganized courts of admiralty and
         vice-admiralty. It was the most effective, because it deprived the defendant of the right
         to be tried by a jury which was almost certain to acquit him." 11 W. Holdsworth, A History
         of English Law 110 (1966). While the vice-admiralty courts dealt chiefly with criminal
         offenses, their jurisdiction also was extended to many areas of the civil law. Wolfram 654

      <p>[5] When Congress in 1787 adopted the Northwest Ordinance for governance of the territories
         west of the Appalachians, it included a guarantee of trial by jury in civil cases. 2 Thorpe
         960-961.</p>
      <p>[6] The proposal was to add the following language to Art. III: "And a trial by jury shall
         be preserved as usual in civil cases." 2 M. Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention
         of 1787, p. 628 (1911). The debate regarding this proposal is quoted in Colgrove v. Battin,
         supra, at 153-155, n. 8.</p>
      <p>[7] The objection of Mr. Gorham of Massachusetts was that "[t]he constitution of Juries is
         different in different States and the trial itself is usual in different cases in different
         States." 2 M. Farrand, supra, at 628. Commentators have suggested several additional
         reasons for the failure of the convention to include a civil jury guarantee. See Henderson
         294-295; ("[T]he true reason for omitting a similar provision for civil juries was at least
         in part that the convention members simply wanted to go home"); Wolfram 660-666.</p>
      <p>[8] See Henderson 298; Wolfram 667-703. Virginia's recommended jury trial amendment is
         typical: "That, in controversies respecting property, and in suits between man and man, the
         ancient trial by jury is one of the greatest securities to the rights of the people, and
         [ought] to remain sacred and inviolable." 3 J. Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution
         658 (2d ed. 1836).</p>
      <p>[9] The Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, which was passed within six months of the
         organization of the new government and on the day before the first 10 Amendments were
         proposed to the legislatures of the States by the First Congress, provided for a civil jury
         trial right. 1 Stat. 77.</p>
      <p>[10] Thomas Jefferson stated: "I consider [trial by jury] as the only anchor yet imagined
         by man, by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution." 3 The
         Writings of Thomas Jefferson 71 (Washington ed. 1861).</p>
      <p>[11] Wolfram 671. Professor Wolfram has written: </p>
      <p>"[T]he antifederalists were not arguing for the institution of civil jury trial in the
         belief that jury trials were short, inexpensive, decorous and productive of the same
         decisions that judges sitting without juries would produce. The inconveniences of jury
         trial were accepted precisely because in important instances, through its ability to
         disregard substantive rules of law, the jury would reach a result that the judge either
         could not or would not reach. Those who favored the civil jury were not misguided tinkerers
         with procedural devices; they were, for the day, libertarians who avowed that important
         areas of protection for litigants in general, and for debtors in particular, would be
         placed in grave danger unless it were required that juries sit in civil cases." Id., at
         671-672.</p>
      <p>[12] The majority suggests that Dimick v. Schiedt is not relevant to the decision in this
         case because it dealt with the second clause of the Seventh Amendment. Ante, at 336 n. 23.
         I disagree. There is no intimation in that opinion that the first clause should be treated
         any differently from the second. The Dimick Court's respect for the guarantees of the
         Seventh Amendment applies as much to the first clause as to the second.</p>

      <p>[14] The Court's decision in Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois

      <p>[15] See Henderson 302-303 ("In the England of 1790 the phrase `to direct a verdict' was
         common. Further, it was commonplace to instruct the jury `that the plaintiff was entitled
         to recover,' or `the plaintiff must have a verdict' "); Scott, Trial by Jury and the Reform
         of Civil Procedure, 31 Harv. L. Rev. 669, 686 (1918) (cases cited therein).</p>
      <p>[16] To demur, a party would admit the truth of all the facts adduced against him and every
         adverse inference that could be drawn therefrom, and the court would determine which party
         should receive judgment on the basis of these admitted facts and inferences. See Slocum v.
         New York Life Ins. Co., 228 U. S. 364, 388 (1913); Gibson v. Hunter, 2 H. Bl. 187, 126 Eng.

      <p>[17] The Court in Gasoline Products quoted Lord Mansfield, who stated that when a verdict
         is correct as to one issue but erroneous as to another " `for form's sake, we must set
         aside the whole verdict . . . .' " Edie v. East India Co., 1 W. Bl. 295, 298 (K. B. 1761),
         quoted 283 U. S., at 498.</p>
      <p>[18] I agree with the Court that "petitioners did not have a right to a jury trial in the
         equitable injunctive action brought by the SEC." Ante, at 338 n. 24.</p>
      <p>[19] Meeker v. Ambassador Oil Corp., 375 U. S. 160 (1963) (per curiam), is a case where the
         doctrine of collateral estoppel yielded to the right to a jury trial. In Meeker, plaintiffs
         asserted both equitable and legal claims, which presented common issues, and demanded a
         jury trial. The trial court tried the equitable claim first, and decided that claim, and
         the common issues, adversely to plaintiffs. As a result, it held that plaintiffs were
         precluded from relitigating those same issues before a jury on their legal claim. 308 F. 2d
         875, 884 (CA10 1962). Plaintiffs appealed, alleging a denial of their right to a jury
         trial, but the Tenth Circuit affirmed the trial court. This Court reversed the Court of
         Appeals on the basis of Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U. S. 500 (1959), and Dairy
         Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 U. S. 469 (1962), even though, unlike those cases, the equitable
         action in Meeker already had been tried and the common issues determined by the court.
         Thus, even though the plaintiffs in Meeker had received a "full and fair" opportunity to
         try the common issues in the prior equitable action, they nonetheless were given the
         opportunity to retry those issues before a jury. Today's decision is totally inconsistent
         with Meeker and the Court fails to explain this inconsistency.</p>
      <p>[20] The Court's decision today may well extend to other areas, such as antitrust, labor,
         employment discrimination, consumer protection, and the like, where a private plaintiff may
         sue for damages based on the same or similar violations that are the subject of government
         actions.</p>
      <p>[21] This is not to say that Congress cannot commit enforcement of statutorily created
         rights to an "administrative process or specialized court of equity." Curtis v. Loether,
         415 U. S. 189, 195 (1974); see Atlas Roofing Co., Inc. v. Occupational Safety &amp;amp;
