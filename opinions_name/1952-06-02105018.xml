      <span class="num">1</span>
      <p>We are asked to decide whether the President was acting within his constitutional power
         when he issued an order directing the Secretary of Commerce to take possession of and
         operate most of the Nation's steel mills. The mill owners argue that the President's order
         amounts to lawmaking, a legislative function which the Constitution has expressly confided
         to the Congress and not to the President. The Government's position is that the order was
         made on findings of the President that his action was necessary to avert a national
         catastrophe which would inevitably result from a stoppage of steel production, and that in
         meeting this grave emergency the President was acting within the aggregate of his
         constitutional powers as the Nation's Chief Executive and the Commander in Chief of the
         Armed Forces of the United States. The issue emerges here from the following series of
         events:</p>


      <span class="num">2</span>
      <p>In the latter part of 1951, a dispute arose between the steel companies and their employees
         over terms and conditions that should be included in new collective bargaining agreements.
         Long-continued conferences failed to resolve the dispute. On December 18, 1951, the
         employees' representative, United Steelworkers of America, C.I.O., gave notice of an
         intention to strike when the existing bargaining agreements expired on December 31. The
         Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service then intervened in an effort to get labor and
         management to agree. This failing, the President on December 22, 1951, referred the dispute
         to the Federal Wage Stabilization Board<a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref">1</a>
         to investigate and make recommendations for fair and equitable terms of settlement. This
         Board's report resulted in no settlement. On April 4, 1952, the Union gave notice of a
         nation-wide strike called to begin at 12:01 a.m. April 9. The indispensability of steel as
         a component of substantially all weapons and other war materials led the President to
         believe that the proposed work stoppage would immediately jeopardize our national defense
         and that governmental seizure of the steel mills was necessary in order to assure the
         continued availability of steel. Reciting these considerations for his action, the
         President, a few hours before the strike was to begin, issued Executive Order 10340, a copy
         of which is attached as an appendix, post, 72 S.Ct. 868. The order directed the Secretary
         of Commerce to take possession of most of the steel mills and keep them running. The
         Secretary immediately issued his own possessory orders, calling upon the presidents of the
         various seized companies to serve as operationg managers for the United States. They were
         directed to carry on their activities in accordance with regulations and directions of the
         Secretary. The next morning the President sent a message to Congress reporting his action.
         Cong.Rec., April 9, 1952, p. 3962. Twelve days later he sent a second message. Cong.Rec.,
         April 21, 1952, p. 4192. Congress has taken no action.</p>


      <span class="num">3</span>
      <p>Obeying the Secretary's orders under protest, the companies brought proceedings against him
         in the District Court. Their complaints charged that the seizure was not authorized by an
         act of Congress or by any constitutional provisions. The District Court was asked to
         declare the orders of the President and the Secretary invalid and to issue preliminary and
         permanent injunctions restraining their enforcement. Opposing the motion for preliminary
         injunction, the United States asserted that a strike disrupting steel production for even a
         brief period would so endanger the well-being and safety of the Nation that the President
         had 'inherent power' to do what he had done&amp;#8212;power 'supported by the Constitution,
         by historical precedent, and by court decisions.' The Government also contended that in any
         event no preliminary injunction should be issued because the companies had made no showing
         that their available legal remedies were inadequate or that their injuries from seizure
         would be irreparable. Holding against the Government on all points, the District Court on
         April 30 issued a preliminary injunction restraining the Secretary from 'continuing the
         seizure and possession of the plant * * * and from acting under the purported authority of
         Executive Order No. 10340.' 103 F.Supp. 569. On the same day the Court of Appeals stayed
         the District Court's injunction. 197 F.2d 582. Deeming it best that the issues raised be
         promptly decided by this Court, we granted certiorari on May 3 and set the cause for
         argument on May 12. <span class="citation">

      <span class="num">4</span>
      <p>Two crucial issues have developed: First. Should final determination of the constitutional
         validity of the President's order be made in this case which has proceeded no further than
         the preliminary injunction stage? Second. If so, is the seizure order within the
         constitutional power of the President?</p>

      <p>I.</p>

      <span class="num">5</span>
      <p>It is urged that there were nonconstitutional grounds upon which the District Court could
         have denied the preliminary injunction and thus have followed the customary judicial
         practice of declining to reach and decide constitutional questions until compelled to do
         so. On this basis it is argued that equity's extraordinary injunctive relief should have
         been denied because (a) seizure of the companies' properties did not inflict irreparable
         damages, and (b) there were available legal remedies adequate to afford compensation for
         any possible damages which they might suffer. While separately argued by the Government,
         these two contentions are here closely related, if not identical. Arguments as to both rest
         in large part on the Government's claim that should the seizure ultimately be held
         unlawful, the companies could recover full compensation in the Court of Claims for the
         unlawful taking. Prior cases in this Court have cast doubt on the right to recover in the
         Court of Claims on account of properties unlawfully taken by government officials for
         public use as these properties were alleged to have been. See e.g., Hooe v. United States,
            <span class="citation">

         governmental operation of these going businesses were bound to result in many present and
         future damages of such nature as to be difficult, if not incapable, of measurement. Viewing
         the case this way, and in the light of the facts presented, the District Court saw no
         reason for delaying decision of the constitutional validity of the orders. We agree with
         the District Court and can see no reason why that question was not ripe for determination
         on the record presented. We shall therefore consider and determine that question now.</p>

      <p>II.</p>

      <span class="num">6</span>
      <p>The President's power, if any, to issue the order must stem either from an act of Congress
         or from the Constitution itself. There is no statute that expressly authorizes the
         President to take possession of property as he did here. Nor is there any act of Congress
         to which our attention has been directed from which such a power can fairly be implied.
         Indeed, we do not understand the Government to rely on statutory authorization for this
         seizure. There are two statutes which do authorize the President to take both personal and
         real property under certain conditions.<a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref">2</a>
         However, the Government admits that these conditions were not met and that the President's
         order was not rooted in either of the statutes. The Government refers to the seizure
         provisions of one of these statutes (&amp;#167; 201(b) of the Defense Production Act) as
         'much too cumbersome, involved, and time-consuming for the crisis which was at hand.'</p>


      <span class="num">7</span>
      <p>Moreover, the use of the seizure technique to solve labor disputes in order to prevent work
         stoppages was not only unauthorized by any congressional enactment; prior to this
         controversy, Congress had refused to adopt that method of settling labor disputes. When the
         Taft-Hartley Act was under consideration in 1947, Congress rejected an amendment which
         would have authorized such governmental seizures in cases of emergency.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn3--6" id="fn3--6_ref">3</a> Apparently it was thought that the technique of
         seizure, like that of compulsory arbitration, would interfere with the process of
         collective bargaining.<a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref">4</a> Consequently, the
         plan Congress adopted in that Act did not provide for seizure under any circumstances.
         Instead, the plan sought to bring about settlements by use of the customary devices of
         mediation, conciliation, investigation by boards of inquiry, and public reports. In some
         instances temporary injunctions were authorized to provide cooling-off periods. All this
         failing, unions were left free to strike after a secret vote by employees as to whether
         they wished to accept their employers' final settlement offer.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn5--4" id="fn5--4_ref">5</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">8</span>
      <p>It is clear that if the President had authority to issue the order he did, it must be found
         in some provisions of the Constitution. And it is not claimed that express constitutional
         language grants this power to the President. The contention is that presidential power
         should be implied from the aggregate of his powers under the Constitution. Particular
         reliance is placed on provisions in Article II which say that 'the executive Power shall be
         vested in a President * * *'; that 'he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully
         executed'; and that he 'shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United
         States.'</p>


      <span class="num">9</span>
      <p>The order cannot properly be sustained as an exercise of the President's military power as
         Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. The Government attempts to do so by citing a number
         of cases upholding broad powers in military commanders engaged in day-to-day fighting in a
         theater of war. Such cases need not concern us here. Even though 'theater of war' be an
         expanding concept, we cannot with faithfulness to our constitutional system hold that the
         Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces has the ultimate power as such to take possession of
         private property in order to keep labor disputes from stopping production. This is a job
         for the Nation's lawmakers, not for its military authorities.</p>


      <span class="num">10</span>
      <p>Nor can the seizure order be sustained because of the several constitutional provisions
         that grant executive power to the President. In the framework of our Constitution, the
         President's power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is
         to be a lawmaker. The Constitution limits his functions in the lawmaking process to the
         recommending of laws he tninks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad. And the
         Constitution is neither silent nor equivocal about who shall make laws which the President
         is to execute. The first section of the first article says that 'All legislative Powers
         herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States * * *.' After granting
         many powers to the Congress, Article I goes on to provide that Congress may 'make all Laws
         which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and
         all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in
         any Department or Officer thereof.'</p>


      <span class="num">11</span>
      <p>The President's order does not direct that a congressional policy be executed in a manner
         prescribed by Congress&amp;#8212;it directs that a presidential policy be executed in a
         manner prescribed by the President. The preamble of the order itself, like that of many
         statutes, sets out reasons why the President believes certain policies should be adopted,
         proclaims these policies as rules of conduct to be followed, and again, like a statute,
         authorizes a government official to promulgate additional rules and regulations consistent
         with the policy proclaimed and needed to carry that policy into execution. The power of
         Congress to adopt such public policies as those proclaimed by the order is beyond question.
         It can authorize the taking of private property for public use. It can makes laws
         regulating the relationships between employers and employees, prescribing rules designed to
         settle labor disputes, and fixing wages and working conditions in certain fields of our
         economy. The Constitution did not subject this law-making power of Congress to presidential
         or military supervision or control.</p>


      <span class="num">12</span>
      <p>It is said that other Presidents without congressional authority have taken possession of
         private business enterprises in order to settle labor disputes. But even if this be true,
         Congress has not thereby lost its exclusive constitutional authority to make laws necessary
         and proper to carry out the powers vested by the Constitution 'in the Government of the
         United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.'</p>


      <span class="num">13</span>
      <p>The Founders of this Nation entrusted the law making power to the Congress alone in both
         good and bad times. It would do no good to recall the historical events, the fears of power
         and the hopes for freedom that lay behind their choice. Such a review would but confirm our
         holding that this seizure order cannot stand.</p>

         application of the principle to the circumstances of this case. Even though such
         differences in attitude toward this principle may be merely differences in emphasis and
         nuance, they can hardly be reflected by a single opinion for the Court. Individual

      <p>1. The Secretary of Commerce is hereby authorized and directed to take possession of all or
         such of the plants, facilities, and other property of the companies named in the list
         attached hereto (List of specific Steel Companies and Plants omitted), or any part thereof,
         as he may deem necessary in the interests of national defense; and to operate or to arrange

         operation.</p>


      <span class="num">31</span>
      <p>2. In carrying out this order the Secretary of Commerce may act through or with the aid of
         such public or private instrumentalities or persons as he may designate; and all Federal

         carrying out the purposes of this order.</p>


      <span class="num">32</span>

         the rights of workers to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing
         and to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining, adjustment
         of grievances, or other mutual aid or protection, provided that such activities do not
         interfere with the operation of such plants, facilities, and other properties.</p>

      <p>4. Except so far as the Secretary of Commerce shall otherwise provide from time to time,
         the managements of the plants, facilities, and other properties possession of which is
         taken pursuant to this order shall continue their functions, including the collection and
         disbursement of funds in the usual and ordinary course of business in the names of their
         respective companies and by means of any instrumentalities used by such companies.</p>


      <span class="num">34</span>
      <p>5. Except so far as the Secretary of Commerce may otherwise direct, existing rights and
         obligations of such companies shall remain in full force and effect, and there may be made,

      <span class="num">40</span>
      <p>Before the cares of the White House were his own, President Harding is reported to have
         said that government after all is a very simple thing. He must have said that, if he said
         it, as a fleeting inhabitant of fairyland. The opposite is the truth. A constitutional
         democracy like ours is perhaps the most difficult of man's social arrangements to manage
         successfully. Our scheme of society is more dependent than any other form of government on
         knowledge and wisdom and self-descipline for the achievement of its aims. For our democracy
         implies the reign of reason on the most extensive scale. The Founders of this Nation were
         not imbued with the modern cynicism that the only thing that history teaches is that it
         teaches nothing. They acted on the conviction that the experience of man sheds a good deal
         of light on his nature. It sheds a good deal of light not merely on the need for effective
         power, if a society is to be at once cohesive and civilized, but also on the need for
         limitations on the power of governors over the governed.</p>


      <span class="num">41</span>
      <p>To that end they rested the structure of our central government on the system of checks and
         balances. For them the doctrine of separation of powers was not mere theory; it was a felt
         necessity. Not so long ago it was fashionable to find our system of checks and balances
         obstructive to effective government. It was easy to ridicule that system as
         outmoded&amp;#8212;too easy. The experience through which the world has passed in our own
         day has made vivid the realization that the Framers of our Constitution were not
         inexperienced doctrinaires. These long-headed statesmen had no illusion that our people
         enjoyed biological or psychological or sociological immunities from the hazards of
         concentrated power. It is absurd to see a dictator in a representative product of the
         sturdy democratic traditions of the Mississippi Valley. The accretion of dangerous power
         does not come in a day. It does come, however slowly, from the generative force of
         unchecked disregard of the restrictions that fence in even the most disinterested assertion
         of authority.</p>


      <span class="num">42</span>
      <p>The Framers, however, did not make the judiciary the overseer of our government. They were
         familiar with the revisory functions entrusted to judges in a few of the States and refused
         to lodge such powers in this Court. Judicial power can be exercised only as to matters that
         were the traditional concern of the courts at Westminster, and only if they arise in ways
         that to the expert feel of lawyers constitute 'Cases' or 'Controversies.' Even as to
         questions that were the staple of judicial business, it is not for the courts to pass upon
         them unless they are indispensably involved in a conventional litigation. And then, only to
         the extent that they are so involved. Rigorous adherence to the narrow scope of the
         judicial function is especially demanded in controversies that arouse appeals to the
         Constitution. The attitude with which this Court must approach its duty when confronted
         with such issues is precisely the opposite of that normally manifested by the general
         public. So-called constitutional questions seem to exercise a mesmeric influence over the
         popular mind. This eagerness to settle&amp;#8212;preferably forever a specific problem on
         the basis of the broadest possible constitutional pronouncements may not unfairly be called
         one of our minor national traits. An English observer of our scene has acutely described
         it: 'At the first sound of a new argument over the United States Constitution and its
         interpretation the hearts of Americans leap with a fearful joy. The blood stirs powerfully
         in their veins and a new lustre brightens their eyes. Like King Harry's men before
         Harfleur, they stand like greyhounds in the slips, straining upon the start.' The
         Economist, May 10, 1952, p. 370.</p>


      <span class="num">43</span>
      <p>The path of duty for this Court, it bears repetition, lies in the opposite direction. Due
         regard for the implications of the distribution of powers in our Constitution and for the
         nature of the judicial process as the ultimate authority in interpreting the Constitution,
         has not only confined the Court within the narrow domain of appropriate adjudication. It
         has also led to 'a series of rules under which it has avoided passing upon a large part of
         all the constitutional questions pressed upon it for decision.' Brandeis, J., in Ashwander
         v. Tennessee Valley Authority, <span class="citation">

         Court not to pass on a constitutional issue at all, however narrowly it may be confined, if
         the case may, as a matter of intellectual honesty, be decided without even considering
         delicate problems of power under the Constitution. It ought to be, but apparently is not a
         matter of common understanding that clashes between different branches of the government
         should be avoided if a legal ground of less explosive potentialities is properly available.
         Constitutional adjudications are apt by exposing differences to exacerbate them.</p>


      <span class="num">44</span>
      <p>So here our first inquiry must be not into the powers of the President, but into the powers
         of a District Judge to issue a temporary injunction in the circumstances of this case.
         Familiar as that remedy is, it remains an extraordinary remedy. To start with a
         consideration of the relation between the President's powers and those of
         Congress&amp;#8212;a most delicate matter that has occupied the thoughts of statesmen and
         judges since the Nation was founded and will continue to occupy their thoughts as long as
         our democracy lasts&amp;#8212;is to start at the wrong end. A plaintiff is not entitled to
         an injunction if money damages would fairly compensate him for any wrong he may have
         suffered. The same considerations by which the Steelworkers, in their brief amicus,
         demonstrate, from the seizure here in controversy, consequences that cannot be translated
         into dollars and cents, preclude a holding that only compensable damage for the plaintiffs
         is involved. Again, a court of equity ought not to issue an injunction, even though a
         plaintiff otherwise makes out a case for it, if the plaintiff's right to an injunction is
         overborne by a commanding public interest against it. One need not resort to a large
         epigrammatic generalization that the evils of industrial dislocation are to be preferred to
         allowing illegality to go unchecked. To deny inquiry into the President's power in a case
         like this, because of the damage to the public interest to be feared from upsetting its
         exercise by him, would in effect always preclude inquiry into challenged power, which
         presumably only avowed great public interest brings into action. And so, with the utmost
         unwillingness, with every desire to avoid judicial inquiry into the powers and duties of
         the other two branches of the government, I cannot escape consideration of the legality of
         Executive Order No. 10340.</p>

         of the office, as it is to conjure up hypothetical future cases. The judiciary may, as this
         case proves, have to intervene in determining where authority lies as between the
         democratic forces in our scheme of government. But in doing so we should be wary and
         humble. Such is the teaching of this Court's role in the history of the country.</p>


      <span class="num">48</span>
      <p>It is in this mood and with this perspective that the issue before the Court must be
         approached. We must therefore put to one side consideration of what powers the President
         would have had if there had been no legislation whatever bearing on the authority asserted
         by the seizure, or if the seizure had been only for a short, explicitly temporary period,
         to be terminated automatically unless Congressional approval were given. These and other
         questions, like or unlike, are not now here. I would exceed my authority were I to say
         anything about them.</p>


      <span class="num">49</span>
      <p>The question before the Court comes in this setting. Congress has frequently&amp;#8212;at
         least 16 times since 1916&amp;#8212; specifically provided for executive seizure of
         production, transportation, communications, or storage facilities. In every case it has
         qualified this grant of power with limitations and safeguards. This body of
         enactments&amp;#8212;summarized in tabular form in Appendix I&amp;#8212;demonstrates that
         Congress deemed seizure so drastic a power as to require that it be carefully circumscribed
         whenever the President was vested with this extraordinary authority. The power to seize has
         uniformly been given only for a limited period or for a defined emergency, or has been
         repealed after a short period. Its exercise has been restricted to particular circumstances
         such as 'time of war or when was is imminent,' the needs of 'public safety' or of 'national
         security or defense,' or 'urgent and impending need.' The period of governmental operation
         has been limited, as, for instance, to 'sixty days after the restoration of productive
         efficiency.' Seizure statutes usually make executive action dependent on detailed
         conditions: for example, (a) failure or refusal of the owner of a plant to meet
         governmental supply needs or (b) failure of voluntary negotiations with the owner for the
         use of a plant necessary for great public ends. Congress often has specified the particular
         executive agency which should seize or operate the plants or whose judgment would
         appropriately test the need for seizure. Congress also has not left to implication that
         just compensation be paid: it has usually legislated in detail regarding enforcement of
         this litigation-breeding general requirement.</p>


      <span class="num">50</span>
      <p>Congress in 1947 was again called upon to consider whether governmental seizure should be
         used to avoid serious industrial shutdowns. Congress decided against conferring such power
         generally and in advance, without special congressional enactment to meet each particular
         need. Under the urgency of telephone and coal strikes in the winter of 1946, Congress
         addressed itself to the problems raised by 'national emergency' strikes and lockouts.<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn1-1" id="fn1-1_ref">1</a> The termination of wartime seizure
         powers on December 31, 1946, brought these matters to the attention of Congress with vivid
         impact. A proposal that the President be given powers to seize plants to avert a shutdown
         where the 'health or safety' of the nation was endangered, was thoroughly canvassed by
         Congress and rejected. No room for doubt remains that the proponents as well as the
         opponents of the bill which became the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 clearly
         understood that as a result of that legislation the only recourse for preventing a shutdown
         in any basic industry, after failure of mediation, was Congress.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn2-1" id="fn2-1_ref">2</a> Authorization for seizure as an available remedy for
         potential dangers was unequivocally put aside. The Senate Labor Committee, through its
         Chairman, explicitly reported to the Senate that a general grant of seizure powers had been
         considered and rejected in favor of reliance on ad hoc legislation, as a particular
         emergency might call for it.<a class="footnote" href="#fn3--5" id="fn3--5_ref">3</a> An
         amendment presented in the House providing that where necessary 'to preserve and protect
         the public health and security' the President might seize any industry in which there is an
         impending curtailment of production, was voted down after debate, by a vote of more than
         three to one.<a class="footnote" href="#fn4-1" id="fn4-1_ref">4</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">51</span>
      <p>In adopting the provisions which it did, by the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, for
         dealing with a 'national emergency' arising out of a breakdown in peaceful industrial
         relations, Congress was very familiar with Government seizure as a protective measure. On a
         balance of considerations Congress chose not to lodge this power in the President. It chose
         not to make available in advance a remedy to which both industry and labor were fiercely
            hostile.<a class="footnote" href="#fn5--3" id="fn5--3_ref">5</a> In deciding that
         authority to seize should be given to the President only after full consideration of the
         particular situation should show such legislation to be necessary, Congress presumably
         acted on experience with similar industrial conflicts in the past. It evidently assumed
         that industrial shutdowns in basic industries are not instances of spontaneous generation,
         and that danger warnings are sufficiently plain before the event to give ample opportunity
         to start the legislative process into action.</p>


      <span class="num">52</span>
      <p>In any event, nothing can be plainer than that Congress made a conscious choice of policy
         in a field full of perplexity and peculiarly within legislative responsibility for choice.
         In formulating legislation for dealing with industrial conflicts, Congress could not more
         clearly and emphatically have withheld authority than it did in 1947. Perhaps as much so as
         is true of any piece of modern legislation, Congress acted with full consciousness of what
         it was doing and in the light of much recent history. Previous seizure legislation had
         subjected the powers granted to the President to restrictions of varying degrees of
         stringency. Instead of giving him even limited powers, Congress in 1947 deemed it wise to
         require the President, upon failure of attempts to reach a voluntary settlement, to report
         to Congress if he deemed the power of seizure a needed shot for his locker. The President
         could not ignore the specific limitations of prior seizure statutes. No more could he act
         in disregard of the limitation put upon seizure by the 1947 Act.</p>


      <span class="num">53</span>
      <p>It cannot be contended that the President would have had power to issue this order had
         Congress explicitly negated such authority in formal legislation. Congress has expressed
         its will to withhold this power from the President as though it had said so in so many
         words. The authoritatively expressed purpose of Congress to disallow such power to the
         President and to require him, when in his mind the occasion arose for such a seizure, to
         put the matter to Congress and ask for specific authority from it, could not be more
         decisive if it had been written into &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 206&amp;#8212;210 of the Labor
         Management Relations Act of 1947. Only the other day we treated the Congressional gloss
         upon those sections as part of the Act. Amalgamated Ass'n of Street Electric Railway

         a purpOSE of Congress thus unequivocally expressed is the regular legislative mode for
         defining the scope of an Act of Congress. It would be not merely infelicitous draftsmanship
         but almost offensive gaucherie to write such a restriction upon the President's power in
         terms into a statute rather than to have it authoritatively expounded, as it was, by
         controlling legislative history.</p>


      <span class="num">54</span>
      <p>By the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, Congress said to the President, 'You may not
         seize. Please report to us and ask for seizure power if you think it is needed in a
         specific situation.' This of course calls for a report on the unsuccessful efforts to reach
         a voluntary settlement, as a basis for discharge by Congress of its
         responsibility&amp;#8212;which it has unquivocally reserved&amp;#8212;to fashion further
         remedies than it provided.<a class="footnote" href="#fn6--8" id="fn6--8_ref">6</a> But it
         is now claimed that the President has seizure power by virtue of the Defense Production Act
         of 1950 and its Amendments.<a class="footnote" href="#fn7--8" id="fn7--8_ref">7</a> And the
         claim is based on the occurrence of new events&amp;#8212;Korea and the need for
         stabilization, etc.&amp;#8212;although it was well known that seizure power was withheld by
         the Act of 1947 and although the President, whose specific requests for other authority
         were in the main granted by Congress, never suggested that in view of the new events he
         needed the power of seizure which Congress in its judgment had decided to withhold from
         him. The utmost that the Korean conflict may imply is that it may have been desirable to
         have given the President further authority, a freer hand in these matters. Absence of
         authority in the President to deal with a crisis does not imply want of power in the
         Government. Conversely the fact that power exists in the Government does not vest it in the
         President. The need for new legislation does not enact it. Nor does it repeal or amend
         existing law.</p>


      <span class="num">55</span>
      <p>No authority that has since been given to the President can by any fair process of
         statutory construction be deemed to withdraw the restriction or change the will of Congress
         as expressed by a body of enactments, culminating in the Labor Management Relations Act of
         1947. Title V of the Defense Production Act, entitled 'Settlement of Labor Disputes,'
         pronounced the will of Congress 'that there be effective procedures for the settlement of
         labor disputes affecting national defense,' and that 'primary reliance' be placed 'upon the
         parties to any labor dispute to make every effort through negotiation and collective
         bargaining and the full use of mediation and conciliation facilities to effect a settlement
         in the national interest.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn8--8" id="fn8--8_ref">8</a> Section
         502 authorized the President to hold voluntary conferences of labor, industry, and public
         and government representatives and to 'take such action as may be agreed upon in any such
         conference and appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title,' provided that no
         action was taken inconsistent with the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947.<a

      <p>'It should be remembered in this connection that during the period of the present emergency
         it is expected that the Congress will not adjourn, but at most, will recess only for very
         limited periods of time. If, therefore, any serious work stoppage should arise or even be
         threatened, in spite of the terms of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, the
         Congress would be readily available to pass such legislation as might be needed to meet the
            difficulty.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn14" id="fn14_ref">14</a>

      <span class="num">57</span>
      <p>The Defense Production Act affords no ground for the suggestion that the 1947 denial to the
         President of seizure powers has been impliedly repealed, and its legislative history
         contradicts such a suggestion. Although the proponents of that Act recognized that the
         President would have a choice of alternative methods of seeking a mediated settlement, they
         also recognized that Congress alone retained the ultimate coercive power to meet the threat
         of 'any serious work stoppage.'</p>


      <span class="num">58</span>
      <p>That conclusion is not changed by what occurred after the passage of the 1950 Act. Seven
         and a half months later, on April 21, 1951, the President by Executive Order 10233 gave the
         reconstituted Wage Stabilization Board authority to investigate labor disputes either (1)
         submitted voluntarily by the parties, or (2) referred to it by the President.<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn15" id="fn15_ref">15</a> The Board can make only
         'recommendations to the parties as to fair and equitable terms of settlement' unless the
         parties agree to be bound by the Board's recommendation. About a month thereafter
         Sub-Committees of both the House and Senate Labor Committees began hearings on the newly
         assigned disputes functions of the Board.<a class="footnote" href="#fn16" id="fn16_ref"
            >16</a> Amendments to deny the Board these functions were voted down in the House,<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn17" id="fn17_ref">17</a> and Congress extended the Defense
         Production Act without changing Title V in relevant part.<a class="footnote" href="#fn18"
            id="fn18_ref">18</a> The legislative history of the Defense Production Act and its
         Amendments in 1951 cannot possibly be vouched for more than Congressional awareness and
         tacit approval that the President had charged the Wage Stabilization Board with authority
         to seek voluntary settlement of labor disputes. The most favorable interpretation of the
         statements in the committee reports can make them mean no more than 'We are glad to have
         all the machinery possible for the voluntary settlement of labor disputes.' In considering
         the Defense Production Act Amendments, Congress was never asked to approve&amp;#8212;and
         there is not the slightest indication that the responsible committees ever had in mind
         seizure of plants to coerce settlement of disputes. We are not even confronted by an
         inconsistency between the authority conferred on the Wage Board, as formulated by the
         Executive Order, and the denial of Presidential seizure powers under the 1947 legislation.
         The Board has been given merely mediatory powers similar to those of agencies created by
         the Taft-Hartley Act and elsewhere, with no other sanctions for acceptance of its
         recommendations than are offered by its own moral authority and the pressure of public
         opinion. The Defense Production Act and the disputes-mediating agencies created subsequent
         to it still leave for solution elsewhere the question what action can be taken when
         attempts at voluntary settlement fail. To draw implied approval of seizure power from this
         history is to make something out of nothing.</p>


      <span class="num">59</span>
      <p>It is one thing to draw an intention of Congress from general language and to say that
         Congress would have explicitly written what is inferred, where Congress has not addressed
         itself to a specific situation. It is quite impossible, however, when Congress did
         specifically address itself to a problem, as Congress did to that of seizure, to find
         secreted in the interstices of legislation the very grant of power which Congress
         consciously withheld. To find authority so explicitly withheld is not merely to disregard
         in a particular instance the clear will of Congress. It is to disrespect the whole
         legislative process and the constitutional division of authority between President and
         Congress.</p>


      <span class="num">60</span>
      <p>The legislative history here canvassed is relevant to yet another of the issues before us,
         namely, the Government's argument that overriding public interest prevents the issuance of
         the injunction despite the illegality of the seizure. I cannot accept that contention.
         'Balancing the equities' when considering whether an injunction should issue, is lawyers'
         jargon for choosing between conflicting public interests. When Congress itself has struck
         the balance, has defined the weight to be given the competing interests, a court of equity
         is not justified in ignoring that pronouncement under the guise of exercising equitable
         discretion.</p>


      <span class="num">61</span>
      <p>Apart from his vast share of responsibility for the conduct of our foreign relations, the
         embracing function of the President is that 'he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully
         executed * * *.' Art. II, &amp;#167; 3. The nature of that authority has for me been
         comprehensively indicated by Mr. Justice Holmes. 'The duty of the President to see that the
         laws be executed is a duty that does not go beyond the laws or require him to achieve more
         than Congress sees fit to leave within his power.' Myers v. United States, <span
            class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/w17/myers-v-united-states/">
               <span class="volume">272</span>

         </span>, 177, 47 S.Ct. 21, 85, 71 L.Ed. 160. The powers of the President are not as
         particularized as are those of Congress. But unenumerated powers do not mean undefined
         powers. The separation of powers built into our Constitution gives essential content to
         undefined provisions in the frame of our government.</p>


      <span class="num">62</span>
      <p>To be sure, the content of the three authorities of government is not to be derived from an
         abstract analysis. The areas are partly interacting, not wholly disjointed. The
         Constitution is a framework for government. Therefore the way the framework has
         consistently operated fairly establishes that it has operated according to its true nature.
         Deeply embedded traditional ways of conducting government cannot supplant the Constitution
         or legislation, but they give meaning to the words of a text or supply them. It is an
         inadmissibly narrow conception of American constitutional law to confine it to the words of
         the Constitution and to disregard the gloss which life has written upon them. In short, a
         systematic, unbroken, executive practice, long pursued to the knowledge of the Congress and
         never before questioned, engaged in by Presidents who have also sworn to uphold the
         Constitution, making as it were such exercise of power part of the structure of our
         government, may be treated as a gloss on 'executive Power' vested in the President by
         &amp;#167; 1 of Art. II.</p>


      <span class="num">63</span>
      <p>Such was the case of United States v. Midwest Oil Co., <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/vff/united-states-v-midwest-oil-co/">
               <span class="volume">236</span>

               <span class="page">459</span>
            </a>
         </span>, 35 S.Ct. 309, 59 L.Ed. 673. The contrast between the circumstances of that case
         and this one helps to draw a clear line between authority not explicitly conferred yet
         authorized to be exercised by the President and the denial of such authority. In both
         instances it was the concern of Congress under express constitutional grant to make rules
         and regulations for the problems with which the President dealt. In the one case he was
         dealing with the protection of property belonging to the United States; in the other with
         the enforcement of the Commerce Clause and with raising and supporting armies and
         maintaining the Navy. In the Midwest Oil case lands which Congress had opened for entry
         were, over a period of 80 years and in 252 instances, and by Presidents learned and
         unlearned in the law, temporarily withdrawn from entry so as to enable Congress to deal
         with such withdrawals. No remotely comparable practice can be vouched for executive seizure
         of property at a time when this country was not at war, in the only constitutional way in
         which it can be at war. It would pursue the irrelevant to reopen the controversy over the
         constitutionality of some acts of Lincoln during the Civil War. See J. G. Randall,
         Constitutional Problems under Lincoln (Revised ed. 1951). Suffice it to say that he seized
         railroads in territory where armed hostilities had already interrupted the movement of
         troops to the beleaguered Capitol, and his order was ratified by the Congress.</p>


      <span class="num">64</span>
      <p>The only other instances of seizures are those during the periods of the first and second
         World Wars.<a class="footnote" href="#fn19" id="fn19_ref">19</a> In his eleven seizures of
         industrial facilities, President Wilson acted, or at least purported to act,<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn20" id="fn20_ref">20</a> under authority granted by Congress.
         Thus his seizures cannot be adduced as interpretations by a President of his own powers in
         the absence of statute.</p>


      <span class="num">65</span>
      <p>Down to the World War II period, then, the record is barren of instances comparable to the
         one before us. Of twelve seizures by President Roosevelt prior to the enactment of the War
         Labor Disputes Act in June, 1943, three were sanctioned by existing law, and six others
         were effected after Congress, on December 8, 1941, had declared the existence of a state of
         war. In this case, reliance on the powers that flow from declared war has been commendably
         disclaimed by the Solicitor General. Thus the list of executive assertions of the power of
         seizure in circumstances comparable to the present reduces to three in the six-month period
         from June to December of 1941. We need not split hairs in comparing those actions to the
         one before us, though much might be said by way of differentiation. Without passing on
         their validity, as we are not called upon to do, it suffices to say that these three
         isolated instances do not add up, either in number, scope, duration or contemporaneous
         legal justification, to the kind of executive construction of the Constitution revealed in
         the Midwest Oil case. Nor do they come to us sanctioned by long-continued acquiescence of
         Congress giving decisive weight to a construction by the Executive of its powers.</p>

      <p>A scheme of government like ours no doubt at times feels the lack of power to act with
         complete, all-embracing, swiftly moving authority. No doubt a government with distributed
         authority, subject to be challenged in the courts of law, at least long enough to consider
         and adjudicate the challenge, labors under restrictions from which other governments are
         free. It has not been our tradition to envy such governments. In any event our government
         was designed to have such restrictions. The price was deemed not too high in view of the
         safeguards which these restrictions afford. I know no more impressive words on this subject
         than those of Mr. Justice Brandeis:</p>


      <span class="num">67</span>
      <p>'The doctrine of the separation of powers was adopted by the Convention of 1787, not to
         promote efficiency but to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power. The purpose was not to
         avoid fricition, but, by means of the inevitable friction incident to the distribution of
         the governmental powers among three departments, to save the people from autocarcy.' Myers

      <p>It is not a pleasant judicial duty to find that the President has exceeded his powers and
         still less so when his purposes were dictated by concern for the Nation's wellbeing, in the
         assured conviction that he acted to avert danger. But it would stultify one's faith in our
         people to entertain even a momentary fear that the patriotism and the wisdom of the
         President and the Congress, as well as the long view of the immediate parties in interest,
         will not find ready accommodation for differences on matters which, however close to their
         concern and however intrinsically important, are overshadowed by the awesome issues which
         confront the world. When at a moment of utmost anxiety President Washington turned to this
         Court for advice, and he had to be denied it as beyond the Court's competence to give,
         Chief Justice Jay, on behalf of the Court, wrote thus to the Father of his Country:</p>


      <span class="num">69</span>
      <p>'We exceedingly regret every event that may cause embarrassment to your administration, but
         we derive consolation from the reflection that your judgment will discern what is right,

         preservations of the rights, peace, and dignity of the United States.' Letter of August 8,
         1793, 3 Johnston, Correspondence and Public Papers of John Jay (1891), 489.</p>


      <span class="num">70</span>
      <p>In reaching the conclusion that conscience compels, I too derive consolation from the
         reflection that the President and the Congress between them will continue to safeguard the
         heritage which comes to them straight from George Washington.</p>

      <p> The material in this table is summarized from a number of sources, chief of which are the
         War Labor Reports, contemporary accounts in the New York Times, United States National Wage
         Stabilization Board, Research and statistics report No. 2 (1946), and Johnson, Government
         Seizures and Labor Disputes (Philadelphia, Pa., 1948) (unpublished doctoral dissertation at
         the University of Pennsylvania). Question marks appear in the tables in instances where no
         satisfactory information on the particular point was available.</p>

      <p> Each of the Executive Orders uses the stock phrase "the constitution and laws" as
         authority for the President's action as well as his position as Commander in Chief. Only
         specific statutory authority relied upon is given in this table. The form of reference of
         the particular Executive Order is used. Statutes referred to in the table are analyzed in
         Appendix I, supra, p. 615. For convenience, their citations are repeated here:</p>

      <p>When seizures of transportation facilities were effected through agencies other than the
         War Department, the First War Powers Act of 1941, 55 Stat. 838, was cited. Title I of that
         Act permitted the President to shift certain functions among executive agencies in aid of
         the war effort. The Act of Aug. 29, 1916, authorizing seizure of transportation facilities,
         specified that it should be accomplished through the Secretary of War.</p>

      <span class="num">325</span>
      <p>There can be no doubt that the emergency which caused the President to seize these steel
         plants was one that bore heavily on the country. But the emergency did not create power; it
         merely marked an occasion when power should be exercised. And the fact that it was
         necessary that measures be taken to keep steel in production does not mean that the
         President, rather than the Congress, had the constitutional authority to act. The Congress,
         as well as the President, is trustee of the national welfare. The President can act more
         quickly than the Congress. The President with the armed services at his disposal can move
         with force as well as with speed. All executive power&amp;#8212;from the reign of ancient
         kings to the rule of modern dictators&amp;#8212;has the outward appearance of
         efficiency.</p>


      <span class="num">326</span>
      <p>Legislative power, by contrast, is slower to exercise. There must be delay while the
         ponderous machinery of committees, hearings, and debates is put into motion. That takes
         time; and while the Congress slowly moves into action, the emergency may take its toll in
         wages, consumer goods, war production, the standard of living of the people, and perhaps
         even lives. Legislative action may indeed often be cumbersome, time-consuming, and
         apparently inefficient. But as Mr. Justice Brandeis stated in his dissent in Myers v.
         United States, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/w17/myers-v-united-states/">
               <span class="volume">272</span>

         </span>, 293, 47 S.Ct. 21, 85, 71 L.Ed. 160:</p>


      <span class="num">327</span>
      <p>'The doctrine of the separation of powers was adopted by the Convention of 1787 not to
         promote efficiency but to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power. The purpose was not to
         avoid friction, but, by means of the inevitable friction incident to the distribution of
         the governmental powers among three departments, to save the people from autocracy.' We
         therefore cannot decide this case by determining which branch of government can deal most
         expeditiously with the present crisis. The answer must depend on the allocation of powers
         under the Constitution. That in turn requires an analysis of the conditions giving rise to
         the seizure and of the seizure itself.</p>


      <span class="num">328</span>
      <p>The relations between labor and industry are one of the crucial problems of the era. Their
         solution will doubtless entail many methods&amp;#8212;education of labor leaders and
         business executives; the encouragement of mediation and conciliation by the President and
         the use of his great office in the cause of industrial peace; and the passage of laws. Laws
         entail sanctions&amp;#8212;penalties for their violation. One type of sanction is find and
         imprisonment. Another is seizure of property. An industry may become so lawless, so
         irresponsible as to endanger the whole economy. Seizure of the industry may be the only
         wise and practical solution.</p>


      <span class="num">329</span>
      <p>The method by which industrial peace is achieved is of vital importance not only to the
         parties but to society as well. A determination that sanctions should be applied, that the
         hand of the law should be placed upon the parties, and that the force of the courts should
         be directed against them, is an exercise of legislative power. In some nations that power
         is entrusted to the executive branch as a matter of course or in case of emergencies. We
         chose another course. We chose to place the legislative power of the Federal Government in
         the Congress. The language of the Constitution is not ambiguous or qualified. It places not
         some legislative power in the Congress; Article I, Section 1 says 'All legislative Powers
         herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a
         Senate and House of Representatives.'</p>


      <span class="num">330</span>
      <p>The legislative nature of the action taken by the President seems to me to be clear. When
         the United States takes over an industrial plant to settle a labor controversy, it is
         condemning property. The seizure of the plant is a taking in the constitutional sense.

         </span>, 71 S.Ct. 670, 95 L.Ed. 809. A permanent taking would amount to the nationalization
         of the industry. A temporary taking falls short of that goal. But though the seizure is
         only for a week or a month, the condemnation is complete and the United States must pay
         compensation for the temporary possession. United States v. General Motors Corp., <span

      <p>The power of the Federal Government to condemn property is well established. Kohl v. United
         States, <span class="citation">

               <span class="volume">91</span>

         </span>, 23 L.Ed. 449. It can condemn for any public purpose; and I have no doubt but that
         condemnation of a plant, factory, or industry in order to promote industrial peace would be
         constitutional. But there is a duty to pay for all property taken by the Government. The
         command of the Fifth Amendment is that no 'private property be taken for public use,
         without just compensation. That constitutional requirement has an important bearing on the
         present case.</p>


      <span class="num">332</span>
      <p>The President has no power to raise reveunes. That power is in the Congress by Article I,
         Section 8 of the Constitution. The President might seize and the Congress by subsequent
         action might ratify the seizure.<a class="footnote" href="#fn1-3" id="fn1-3_ref">1</a> But
         until and unless Congress acted, no condemnation would be lawful. The branch of government
         that has the power to pay compensation for a seizure is the only one able to authorize a
         seizure or make lawful one that the President had effected.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn2-3" id="fn2-3_ref">2</a> That seems to me to be the necessary result of the
         condemnation provision in the Fifth Amendment. It squares with the theory of checks and
         balances expounded by Mr. Justice BLACK in the opinion of the Court in which I Join.</p>


      <span class="num">333</span>
      <p>If we sanctioned the present exercise of power by the President, we would be expanding
         Article II of the Constitution and rewriting it to suit the political conveniences of the
         present emergency. Article II which vests the 'executive Power' in the President defines
         that power with particularity. Article II, Section 2 makes the Chief Executive the
         Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy. But our history and tradition rebel at the thought
         that the grant of military power carries with it authority over civilian affairs. Article
         II, Section 3 provides that the President shall 'from time to time give to the Congress
         Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures
         as he shall judge necessary and expedient.' The power to recommend legislation, granted to
         the President, serves only to emphasize that it is his function to recommend and that it is
         the function of the Congress to legislate. Article II, Section 3, also provides that the
         President 'shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.' But as Mr. Justice BLACK
         and Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER point out the power to execute the laws starts and ends with
         the laws Congress has enacted.</p>


      <span class="num">334</span>
      <p>The great office of President is not a weak and powerless one. The President represents the
         people and is their spokesman in domestic and foreign affairs. The office is respected more
         than any other in the land. It gives a position of leadership that is unique. The power to
         formulate policies and mould opinion inheres in the Presidency and conditions our national
         life. The impact of the man and the philosophy he represents may at times be thwarted by
         the Congress. Stalemates may occur when emergencies mount and the Nation suffers for lack
         of harmonious, reciprocal action between the White House and Capitol Hill. That is a risk
         inherent in our system of separation of powers. The tragedy of such stalemates might be
         avoided by allowing the President the use of some legislative authority. The Framers with
         memories of the tyrannies produced by a blending of executive and legislative power
         rejected that political arrangement. Some future generation may, however, deem it so urgent
         that the President have legislative authority that the Constitution will be amended. We
         could not sanction the seizures and condemnations of the steel plants in this case without
         reading Article II as giving the President not only the power to execute the laws but to
         make some. Such a step would most assuredly alter the pattern of the Constitution.</p>


      <span class="num">335</span>
      <p>We pay a price for our system of checks and balances, for the distribution of power among
         the three branches of government. It is a price that today may seem exorbitant to many.
         Today a kindly President uses the seizure power to effect a wage increase and to keep the
         steel furnaces in production. Yet tomorrow another President might use the same power to
         prevent a wage increase, to curb trade unionists, to regiment labor as oppressively as
         industry thinks it has been regimented by this seizure.</p>

      <span class="num">337</span>
      <p>That comprehensive and undefined presidential powers hold both practical advantages and
         grave dangers for the country will impress anyone who has served as legal adviser to a
         President in time of transition and public anxiety. While an interval of detached
         reflection may temper teachings of that experience, they probably are a more realistic
         influence on my views than the conventional materials of judicial decision which seem
         unduly to accentuate doctrine and legal fiction. But as we approach the question of
         presidential power, we half overcome mental hazards by recognizing them. The opinions of
         judges, no less than executives and publicists, often suffer the infirmity of confusing the
         issue of a power's validity with the cause it is invoked to promote, of confounding the
         permanent executive office with its temporary occupant. The tendency is strong to emphasize
         transient results upon policies&amp;#8212;such as wages or stabilization&amp;#8212;and lose
         sight of enduring consequences upon the balanced power structure of our Republic.</p>


      <span class="num">338</span>
      <p>A judge, like an executive adviser, may be surprised at the poverty of really useful and
         unambiguous authority applicable to concrete problems of executive power as they actually
         present themselves. Just what our forefathers did envision, or would have envisioned had
         they foreseen modern conditions, must be divined from materials almost as enigmatic as the
         dreams Joseph was called upon to interpret for Pharaoh. A century and a half of partisan
         debate and scholarly speculation yields no net result but only supplies more or less apt
         quotations from respected sources on each side of any question. They largely cancel each
            other.<a class="footnote" href="#fn1-4" id="fn1-4_ref">1</a> And court decisions are
         indecisive because of the judicial practice of dealing with the largest questions in the
         most narrow way.</p>


      <span class="num">339</span>
      <p>The actual art of governing under our Constitution does not and cannot conform to judicial
         definitions of the power of any of its branches based on isolated clauses or even single
         Articles torn from context. While the Constitution diffuses power the better to secure
         liberty, it also contemplates that practice will integrate the dispersed powers into a
         workable government. It enjoins upon its branches separateness but interdependence,
         autonomy but reciprocity. Presidential powers are not fixed but fluctuate, depending upon
         their disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress. We may well begin by a somewhat
         over-simplified grouping of practical situations in which a President may doubt, or others
         may challenge, his powers, and by distinguishing roughly the legal consequences of this
         factor of relativity.</p>


      <span class="num">340</span>
      <p>1. When the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his
         authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus
         all that Congress can delegate.<a class="footnote" href="#fn2-4" id="fn2-4_ref">2</a> In
         these circumstances, and in these only, may he be said (for what it may be worth), to
         personify the federal sovereignty. If his act is held unconstitutional under these
         circumstances, it usually means that the Federal Government as an undivided whole lacks
         power. A seizure executed by the President pursuant to an Act of Congress would be
         supported by the strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude of judicial
         interpretation, and the burden of persuasion would rest heavily upon any who might attack
         it.</p>


      <span class="num">341</span>
      <p>2. When the President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of
         authority, he can only rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of
         twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority, or in which its
         distribution is uncertain. Therefore, congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence may
         sometimes, at least as a practical matter, enable, if not invite, measures on independent
         presidential responsibility. In this area, any actual test of power is likely to depend on
         the imperatives of events and contemporary imponderables rather than on abstract theories
         of law.<span class="sup">3</span>
      </p>


      <span class="num">342</span>
      <p>3. When the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of
         Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own
         constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter. Courts
         can sustain exclusive Presidential control in such a case only be disabling the Congress
         from acting upon the subject.<a class="footnote" href="#fn4-4" id="fn4-4_ref">4</a>
         Presidential claim to a power at once so conclusive and preclusive must be scrutinized with
         caution, for what is at stake is the equilibruim established by our constitutional
         system.</p>


      <span class="num">343</span>
      <p>Into which of these classifications does this executive seizure of the steel industry fit?
         It is eliminated from the first by admission, for it is conceded that no congressional
         authorization exists for this seizure. That takes away also the support of the many
         precedents and declarations which were made in relation, and must be confined, to this
            category.<span class="sup">5</span>
      </p>


      <span class="num">344</span>
      <p>Can it then be defended under flexible tests available to the second category? It seems
         clearly eliminated from that class because Congress has not left seizure of private
         property an open field but has covered it by three statutory policies inconsistent with
         this seizure. In cases where the purpose is to supply needs of the Government itself, two
         courses are provided: one, seizure of a plant which fails to comply with obligatory orders
         placed by the Government,<span class="sup">6</span> another, condemnation of facilities,
         including temporary use under the power of eminent domain.<span class="sup">7</span> The
         third is applicable where it is the general economy of the country that is to be protected
         rather than exclusive governmental interests.<span class="sup">8</span> None of these were
         invoked. In choosing a different and inconsistent way of his own, the President cannot
         claim that it is necessitated or invited by failure of Congress to legislate upon the
         occasions, grounds and methods for seizure of industrial properties.</p>


      <span class="num">345</span>
      <p>This leaves the current seizure to be justified only by the severe tests under the third
         grouping, where it can be supported only by any remainder of executive power after
         subtraction of such powers as Congress may have over the subject. In short, we can sustain
         the President only by holding that seizure of such strike-bound industries is within his
         domain and beyond control by Congress. Thus, this Court's first review of such seizures
         occurs under circumstances which leave Presidential power most vulnerable to attack and in
         the least favorable of possible constitutional postures.</p>


      <span class="num">346</span>
      <p>I did not suppose, and I am not persuaded, that history leaves it open to question, at
         least in the courts, that the executive branch, like the Federal Government as a whole,
         possesses only delegated powers. The purpose of the Constitution was not only to grant
         power, but to keep it from getting out of hand. However, because the President does not
         enjoy unmentioned powers does not mean that the mentioned ones should be narrowed by a
         niggardly construction. Some clauses could be made almost unworkable, as well as immutable,
         by refusal to indulge some latitude of interpretation for changing times. I have
         heretofore, and do now, give to the enumerated powers the scope and elasticity afforded by
         what seem to be reasonable practical implications instead of the rigidity dictated by a
         doctrinaire textualism.</p>


      <span class="num">347</span>
      <p>The Solicitor General seeks the power of seizure in three clauses of the Executive Article,
         the first reading, 'The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States
         of America.' Lest I be thought to exaggerate, I quote the interpretation which his brief
         puts upon it: 'In our view, this clause constitutes a grant of all the executive powers of
         which the Government is capable.' If that be true, it is difficult to see why the
         forefathers bothered to add several specific items, including some trifling ones.<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn9-1" id="fn9-1_ref">9</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">348</span>
      <p>The example of such unlimited executive power that must have most impressed the forefathers
         was the prerogative exercised by George III, and the description of its evils in the
         Declaration of Independence leads me to doubt that they were creating their new Executive
         in his image. Continental European examples were no more appealing. And if we seek
         instruction from our own times, we can match it only from the executive powers in those
         governments we disparagingly describe as totalitarian. I cannot accept the view that this
         clause is a grant in bulk of all conceivable executive power but regard it as an allocation
         to the presidential office of the generic powers thereafter stated.</p>


      <span class="num">349</span>
      <p>The clause on which the Government next relies is that 'The President shall be Commander in
         Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States * * *.' These cryptic words have given rise
         to some of the most persistent controversies in our constitutional history. Of course, they
         imply something more than an empty title. But just what authority goes with the name has
         plagued Presidential advisers who would not waive or narrow it by nonassertion yet cannot
         say where it begins or ends. It undoubtedly puts the Nation's armed forces under
         Presidential command. Hence, this loose appellation is sometimes advanced as support for
         any Presidential action, internal or external, involving use of force, the idea being that
         it vests power to do anything, anywhere, that can be done with an army or navy.</p>


      <span class="num">350</span>
      <p>That seems to be the logic of an argument tendered at our bar that the President having, on
         his own responsibility, sent American troops abroad derives from that act 'affirmative
         power' to seize the means of producing a supply of steel for them. To quote, 'Perhaps the
         most forceful illustrations of the scope of Presidential power in this connection is the
         fact that American troops in Korea, whose safety and effectiveness are so directly involved
         here, were sent to the field by an exercise of the President's constitutional powers.'
         Thus, it is said he has invested himself with 'war powers.'</p>


      <span class="num">351</span>
      <p>I cannot foresee all that it might entail if the Court should indorse this argument.
         Nothing in our Constitution is plainer than that declaration of a war is entrusted only to
         Congress. Of course, a state of war may in fact exist without a formal declaration. But no
         doctrine that the Court could promulgate would seem to me more sinister and alarming than
         that a President whose conduct of foreign affairs is so largely uncontrolled, and often
         even is unknown, can vastly enlarge his mastery over the internal affairs of the country by
         his own commitment of the Nation's armed forces to some foreign venture.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn10-1" id="fn10-1_ref">10</a> I do not, however, find it necessary or
         appropriate to consider the legal status of the Korean enterprise to discountenance
         argument based on it.</p>


      <span class="num">352</span>
      <p>Assuming that we are in a war de facto, whether it is or is not a war de jure, does that
         empower the Commander-in-Chief to seize industries he thinks necessary to supply our army?
         The Constitution expressly places in Congress power 'to raise and support Armies' and 'to
         provide and maintain a Navy.' (Emphasis supplied.) This certainly lays upon Congress
         primary responsibility for supplying the armed forces. Congress alone controls the raising
         of revenues and their appropriation and may determine in what manner and by what means they
         shall be spent for military and naval procurement. I suppose no one would doubt that
         Congress can take over war supply as a Government enterprise. On the other hand, if
         Congress sess fit to rely on free private enterprise collectively bargaining with free
         labor for support and maintenance of our armed forces can the Executive because of lawful
         disagreements incidental to that process, seize the facility for operation upon
         Government-imposed terms?</p>


      <span class="num">353</span>
      <p>There are indications that the Constitution did not contemplate that the title
         Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy will constitute him also Commander-in-Chief of the
         country, its industries and its inhabitants. He has no monopoly of 'war powers,' whatever
         they are. While Congress cannot deprive the President of the command of the army and navy,
         only Congress can provide him an army or navy to command. It is also empowered to make
         rules for the 'Government and Regulation of land and naval forces,' by which it may to some
         unknown extent impinge upon even command functions.</p>


      <span class="num">354</span>
      <p>That military powers of the Commander-in-Chief were not to supersede representative
         government of internal affairs seems obvious from the Constitution and from elementary
         American history. Time out of mind, and even now in many parts of the world, a military
         commander can seize private housing to shelter his troops. Not so, however, in the United
         States, for the Third Amendment says, 'No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in
         any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be
         prescribed by law.' Thus, even in war time, his seizure of needed military housing must be
         authorized by Congress. It also was expressly left to Congress to 'provide for calling
         forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel
         Invasions * * *.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn11-1" id="fn11-1_ref">11</a> Such a
         limitation on the command power, written at a time when the militia rather than a standing
         army was contemplated as the military weapon of the Republic, underscores the
         Constitution's policy that Congress, not the Executive, should control utilization of the
         war power as an instrument of domestic policy. Congress, fulfilling that function, has
         authorized the President to use the army to enforce certain civil rights.<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn12-1" id="fn12-1_ref">12</a> On the other hand, Congress has
         forbidden him to use the army for the purpose of executing general laws except when
         expressly authorized by the Constitution or by Act of Congress.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn13-1" id="fn13-1_ref">13</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">355</span>
      <p>While broad claims under this rubric often have been made, advice to the President in
         specific matters usually has carried overtones that powers, even under this head, are
         measured by the command functions usual to the topmost officer of the army and navy. Even
         then, heed has been taken of any efforts of Congress to negative his authority.<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn14-1" id="fn14-1_ref">14</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">356</span>
      <p>We should not use this occasion to circumscribe, much less to contract, the lawful role of
         the President as Commander-in-Chief. I should indulge the widest latitude of interpretation
         to sustain his exclusive function to command the instruments of national force, at least
         when turned against the outside world for the security of our society. But, when it is
         turned inward, not because of rebellion but because of a lawful economic struggle between
         industry and labor, it should have no such indulgence. His command power is not such an
         absolute as might be implied from that office in a militaristic system but is subject to
         limitations consistent with a constitutional Republic whose law and policy-making breanch
         is a representative Congress. The purpose of lodging dual titles in one man was to insure
         that the civilian would control the military, not to enable the military to subordinate the
         presidential office. No penance would ever expiate the sin against free government of
         holding that a President can escape control of executive powers by law through assuming his
         military role. What the power of command may include I do not try to envision, but I think
         it is not a military prerogative, without support of law, to seize persons or property
         because they are important or even essential for the military and naval establishment.</p>


      <span class="num">357</span>
      <p>The third clause in which the Solicitor General finds seizure powers is that 'he shall take
         Care that the Laws be faithfully executed * * *.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn15-1"
            id="fn15-1_ref">15</a> That authority must be matched against words of the Fifth
         Amendment that 'No person shall be * * * deprived of life, liberty, or property, without
         due process of law * * *.' One gives a governmental authority that reaches so far as there
         is law, the other gives a private right that authority shall go no farther. These signify
         about all there is of the principle that ours is a government of laws, not of men, and that
         we submit ourselves to rulers only if under rules.</p>


      <span class="num">358</span>
      <p>The Solicitor General lastly grounds support of the seizure upon nebulous, inherent powers
         never expressly granted but said to have accrued to the office from the customs and claims
         of preceding administrations. The plea is for a resulting power to deal with a crisis or an
         emergency according to the necessities of the case, the unarticulated assumption being that
         necessity knows no law.</p>


      <span class="num">359</span>
      <p>Loose and irresponsible use of adjectives colors all non-legal and much legal discussion of
         presidential powers. 'Inherent' powers, 'implied' powers, 'incidental' powers, 'plenary'
         powers, 'war' powers and 'emergency' powers are used, often interchangeably and without
         fixed or ascertainable meanings.</p>


      <span class="num">360</span>
      <p>The vagueness and generality of the clauses that set forth presidential powers afford a
         plausible basis for pressures within and without an administration for presidential action
         beyond that supported by those whose responsibility it is to defend his actions in court.
         The claim of inherent and unrestricted presidential powers has long been a persuasive
         dialectical weapon in political controversy. While it is not surprising that counsel should
         grasp support from such unadjudicated claims of power, a judge cannot accept self-serving
         press statements of the attorney for one of the interested parties as authority in
         answering a constitutional question, even if the advocate was himself. But prudence has
         counseled that actual reliance on such nebulous claims stop short of provoking a judicial
            test.<a class="footnote" href="#fn16-1" id="fn16-1_ref">16</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">361</span>
      <p>The Solicitor General, acknowledging that Congress has never authorized the seizure here,
         says practice of prior Presidents has authorized it. He seeks color of legality from
         claimed executive precedents, chief of which is President Roosevelt's seizure of June 9,
         1941, of the California plant of the North American Aviation Company. Its superficial
         similarities with the present case, upon analysis, yield to distinctions so decisive that
         it cannot be regarded as even a precedent, much less an authority for the present
            seizure.<a class="footnote" href="#fn17-1" id="fn17-1_ref">17</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">362</span>
      <p>The appeal, however, that we declare the existence of inherent powers ex necessitate to
         meet an emergency asks us to do what many think would be wise, although it is something the
         forefathers omitted. They knew what emergencies were, knew the pressures they engender for
         authoritative action, knew, too, how they afford a ready pretext for usurpation. We may
         also suspect that they suspected that emergency powers would tend to kindle emergencies.
         Aside from suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in time of rebellion or
         invasion, when the public safety may require it,<a class="footnote" href="#fn18-1"
            id="fn18-1_ref">18</a> they made no express provision for exercise of extraordinary
         authority because of a crisis.<a class="footnote" href="#fn19-1" id="fn19-1_ref">19</a> I
         do not think we rightfully may so amend their work, and, if we could, I am not convinced it
         would be wise to do so, although many modern nations have forthrightly recognized that war
         and economic crises may upset the normal balance between liberty and authority. Their
         experience with emergency powers may not be irrelevant to the argument here that we should
         say that the Executive, of his own volition, can invest himself with undefined emergency
         powers.</p>


      <span class="num">363</span>
      <p>Germany, after the First World War, framed the Weimar Constitution, designed to secure her
         liberties in the Western tradition. However, the President of the Republic, without
         concurrence of the Reichstag, was empowered temporarily to suspend any or all individual
         rights if public safety and order were seriously distrubed or endangered. This proved a
         temptation to every government, whatever its shade of opinion, and in 13 years suspension
         of rights was invoked on more than 250 occasions. Finally, Hitler persuaded President Von
         Hindenberg to suspend all such rights, and they were never restored.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn20-1" id="fn20-1_ref">20</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">364</span>
      <p>The French Republic provided for a very different kind of emergency government known as the
         'state of siege.' It differed from the German emergency dictatorship, particularly in that
         emergency powers could not be assumed at will by the Executive but could only be granted as
         a parliamentary measure. And it did not, as in Germany, result in a suspension or
         abrogation of law but was a legal institution governed by special legal rules and
         terminable by parliamentary authority.<a class="footnote" href="#fn21" id="fn21_ref">21</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">365</span>
      <p>Great Britain also has fought both World Wars under a sort of temporary dictatorship
         created by legislation.<a class="footnote" href="#fn22" id="fn22_ref">22</a> As Parliament
         is not bound by written constitutional limitations, it established a crisis government
         simply by delegation to its Ministers of a larger measure than usual of its own unlimited
         power, which is exercised under its supervision by Ministers whom it may dismiss. This has
         been called the 'highwater mark in the voluntary surrender of liberty,' but, as Churchill
         put it, 'Parliament stands custodian of these surrendered liberties, and its most sacred
         duty will be to restore them in their fullness when victory has crowned our exertions and
         our perseverance.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn23" id="fn23_ref">23</a> Thus, parliamentary
         control made emergency powers compatible with freedom.</p>


      <span class="num">366</span>
      <p>This contemporary foreign experience may be inconclusive as to the wisdom of lodging
         emergency powers somewhere in a modern government. But it suggests that emergency powers
         are consistent with free government only when their control is lodged elsewhere than in the
         Executive who exercises them. That is the safeguard that would be nullified by our adoption
         of the 'inherent powers' formula. Nothing in my experience convinces me that such risks are
         warranted by any real necessity, although such powers would, of course, be an executive
         convenience.</p>


      <span class="num">367</span>
      <p>In the practical working of our Government we already have evolved a technique within the
         framework of the Constitution by which normal executive powers may be considerably expanded
         to meet an emergency. Congress may and has granted extraordinary authorities which lie
         dormant in normal times but may be called into play by the Executive in war or upon
         proclamation of a national emergency. In 1939, upon congressional request, the Attorney
         General listed ninety-nine such separate statutory grants by Congress of emergency or
         war-time executive powers.<a class="footnote" href="#fn24" id="fn24_ref">24</a> They were
         invoked from time to time as need appeared. Under this procedure we retain Government by
         law&amp;#8212;special, temporary law, perhaps, but law nonetheless. The public may know the
         extent and limitations of the powers that can be asserted, and persons affected may be
         informed from the statute of their rights and duties.</p>

      <p>In view of the ease, expedition and safety with which Congress can grant and has granted
         large emergency powers, certainly ample to embrace this crisis, I am quite unimpressed with
         the argument that we should affirm possession of them without statute. Such power either
         has no beginning or it has no end. If it exists, it need submit to no legal restraint. I am
         not alarmed that it would plunge us straightway into dictatorship, but it is at least a
         step in that wrong direction.</p>


      <span class="num">369</span>
      <p>As to whether there is imperative necessity for such powers, it is relevant to note the gap
         that exists between the President's paper powers and his real powers. The Constitution does
         not disclose the measure of the actual controls wielded by the modern presidential office.
         That instrument must be understood as an Eighteenth-Century sketch of a government hoped
         for, not as a blueprint of the Government that is. Vast accretions of federal power, eroded
         from that reserved by the States, have magnified the scope of presidential activity. Subtle
         shifts take place in the centers of real power that do not show on the face of the
         Constitution.</p>


      <span class="num">370</span>
      <p>Executive power has the advantage of concentration in a single head in those choice the
         whole Nation has a part, making him the focus of public hopes and expectations. In drama,
         magnitude and finality his decisions so far overshadow any others that almost alone he
         fills the public eye and ear. No othe personality in public life can begin to compete with
         him in access to the public mind through modern methods of communications. By his prestige
         as head of state and his influence upon public opinion he exerts a leverage upon those who
         are supposed to check and balance his power which often cancels their effectiveness.</p>


      <span class="num">371</span>
      <p>Moreover, rise of the party system has made a significant extraconstitutional supplement to
         real executive power. No appraisal of his necessities is realistic which overlooks that he
         heads a political system as well as a legal system. Party loyalties and interests,
         sometimes more binding than law, extend his effective control into branches of government
         other than his own and he often may win, as a political leader, what he cannot command
         under the Constitution. Indeed, Woodrow Wilson, commenting on the President as leader both
         of his party and of the Nation, observed, 'If he rightly interpret the national thought and
         boldly insist upon it, he is irresistible. * * * His office is anything he has the sagacity
         and force to make it.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn25" id="fn25_ref">25</a> I cannot be
         brought to believe that this country will suffer if the Court refuses further to aggrandize
         the presidential office, already so potent and so relatively immune from judicial review,<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn26" id="fn26_ref">26</a> at the expense of Congress.</p>


      <span class="num">372</span>
      <p>But I have no illusion that any decision by this Court can keep power in the hands of
         Congress if it is not wise and timely in meeting its problems. A crisis that challenges the
         President equally, or perhaps primarily, challenges Congress. If not good law, there was
         worldly wisdom in the maxim attributed to Napoleon that 'The tools belong to the man who
         can use them.' We may say that power to legislate for emergencies belongs in the hands of
         Congress, but only Congress itself can prevent power from slipping through its fingers.</p>


      <span class="num">373</span>
      <p>The essence of our free Government is 'leave to live by no man's leave, underneath the
         law'&amp;#8212;to be governed by those impersonal forces which we call law. Our Government
         is fashioned to fulfill this concept so far as humanly possible. The Executive, except for
         recommendation and veto, has no legislative power. The executive action we have here
         originates in the individual will of the President and represents an exercise of authority
         without law. No one, perhaps not even the President, knows the limits of the power he may
         seek to exert in this instance and the parties affected cannot learn the limit of their
         rights. We do not know today what powers over labor or property would be claimed to flow
         from Government possession if we should legalize it, what rights to compensation would be
         claimed or recognized, or on what contingency it would end. With all its defects, delays
         and inconveniences, men have discovered no technique for long preserving free government
         except that the Executive be under the law, and that the law be made by parliamentary
         deliberations.</p>


      <span class="num">374</span>
      <p>Such institutions may be destined to pass away. But it is the duty of the Court to be last,
         not first, to give them up.<a class="footnote" href="#fn27" id="fn27_ref">27</a>

      </div><div type="" judge=""><p>Mr. Justice BURTON, concurring in both the opinion and judgment of the Court.</p>

      <p>My position may be summarized as follows:</p>

      <span class="num">376</span>
      <p>The validity of the President's order of seizure is at issue and ripe for decision. Its
         validity turns upon its relation to the constitutional division of governmental power
         between Congress and the President.</p>


      <span class="num">377</span>
      <p>The Constitution has delegated to Congress power to authorize action to meet a national
         emergency of the kind we face.<a class="footnote" href="#fn1-5" id="fn1-5_ref">1</a> Aware
         of this responsibility, Congress has responded to it. It has provided at least two
         procedures for the use of the President.</p>


      <span class="num">378</span>
      <p>It has outlined one in the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, better known as the
         Taft-Hartley Act. The accuracy with which Congress there describes the present emergency
         demonstrates its applicability. It says:</p>


      <span class="num">379</span>
      <p>'Whenever in the opinion of the President of the United States, a threatened or actual
         strike or lock-out affecting an entire industry or a substantial part thereof engaged in
         trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or communication among the several States or
         with foreign nations, or engaged in the production of goods for commerce, will, if
         permitted to occur or to continue, imperil the national health or safety, he may appoint a
         board of inquiry to inquire into the issues involved in the dispute and to make a written
         report to him within such time as he shall prescribe. * * *'<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn2-5" id="fn2-5_ref">2</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">380</span>
      <p>In that situation Congress has authorized not only negotiation, conciliation and impartial
         inquiry but also a 60-day cooling-off period under injunction, followed by 20 days for a
         secret ballot upon the final offer of settlement and then by recommendations from the
         President to Congress.<span class="sup">3</span>
      </p>


      <span class="num">381</span>
      <p>For the purposes of this case the most significant feature of that Act is its omission of
         authority to seize an affected industy. The debate preceding its passage demonstrated the
         significance of that omission. Collective bargaining, rather than governmental seizure, was
         to be relied upon. Seizure was not to be resorted to without specific congressional
         authority. Congress reserved to itself the opportunity to authorize seizure to meet
         particular emergencies.<a class="footnote" href="#fn4-5" id="fn4-5_ref">4</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">382</span>
      <p>The President, however, chose not to use the Taft-Hartley procedure. He chose another
         course, also authorized by Congress. He referred the controversy to the Wage Stabilization
            Board.<span class="sup">5</span> If that course had led to a settlement of the labor
         dispute, it would have avoided the need for other action. It, however, did not do so.</p>


      <span class="num">383</span>
      <p>Now it is contended that although the President did not follow the procedure authorized by
         the Taft-Hartley Act, his substituted procedure served the same purpose and must be
         accepted as it equivalent. Without appraising that equivalence, it is enough to point out
         that neither procedure carried statutory authority for the seizure of private industries in
         the manner now at issue.<span class="sup">6</span> The exhaustion of both procedures fails
         to cloud the clarity of the congressional reservation of seizure for its own
         consideration.</p>


      <span class="num">384</span>
      <p>The foregoing circumstances distinguish this emergency from one in which Congress takes no
         action and outlines no governmental policy. In the case before us, Congress authorized a
         procedure which the President declined to follow. Instead, he followed another procedure
         which he hoped might eliminate the need for the first. Upon its failure, he issued an
         executive order to seize the steel properties in the fact of the reserved right of Congress
         to adopt or reject that course as a matter of legislative policy.</p>


      <span class="num">385</span>
      <p>This brings us to a further crucial question. Does not President, in such a situation, have
         inherent constitutional power to seize private property which makes congressional action in
         relation thereto unnecessary? We find no such power available to him under the present
         circumstances. The present situation is not comparable to that of an imminent invasion or
         threatened attack. We do not face the issue of what might be the President's constitutional
         power to meet such catastrophic situations. Nor is it claimed that the current seizure is
         in the nature of a military command addressed by the President, as Commander-in-Chief, to a
         mobilized nation waging, or imminently threatened with, total war.<span class="sup"
            >7</span>
      </p>


      <span class="num">386</span>
      <p>The controlling fact here is that Congress, within its constitutionally delegated power,
         has prescribed for the President specific procedures, exclusive of seizure, for his use in
         meeting the present type of emergency. Congress has reserved to itself the right to
         determine where and when to authorize the seizure of property in meeting such an emergency.
         Under these circumstances, the President's order of April 8 invaded the jurisdiction of
         Congress. It violated the essence of the principle of the separation of governmental
         powers. Accordingly, the injunction against its effectiveness should be sustained.</p>


      <span class="num">387</span>
      </div><div type="" judge=""><p>Mr. Justice CLARK, concurring in the judgment of the Court.</p>


      <span class="num">388</span>
      <p>One of this Court's first pronouncements upon the powers of the President under the
         Constitution was made by Chief Justice John Marshall some one hundred and fifty years ago.
         In Little v. Barreme,<a class="footnote" href="#fn1-6" id="fn1-6_ref">1</a> he used this
         characteristically clear language in discussing the power of the President to instruct the
         seizure of the 'Flying-Fish,' a vessel bound from a French port: 'It is by no means clear
         that the President of the United States whose high duty it is to 'take care that the laws
         be faithfully executed,' and who is commander in chief of the armies and navies of the
         United States, might not, without any special authority for that purpose, in the then
         existing state of things, have empowered the officers commanding the armed vessels of the
         United States, to seize and send into port for adjudication, American vessels which were
         forfeited by being engaged in this illicit commerce. But when it is observed that (an act
         of Congress) gives a special authority to seize on the high seas, and limits that authority
         to the seizure of vessels bound or sailing to a French port, the legislature seem to have
         prescribed that the manner in which this law shall be carried into execution, was to
         exclude a seizure of any vessel not bound to a French port.'<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn2-6" id="fn2-6_ref">2</a> Accordingly, a unanimous Court held that the
         President's instructions had been issued without authority and that they could not
         'legalize an act which without those instructions would have been a plain trespass.' I know
         of no subsequent holding of this Court to the contrary.<span class="sup">3</span>
      </p>


      <span class="num">389</span>
      <p>The limits of presidential power are obscure. However, Article II, no less than Article I,
         is part of 'a constitution intended to endure for ages to come, and, consequently, to be
         adapted to the various crises of human affairs.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn4-6"
            id="fn4-6_ref">4</a> Some of our Presidents, such as Lincoln, 'felt that measures
         otherwise unconstitutional might become lawful by becoming indispensable to the
         preservation of the Constitution through the preservation of the nation.'<span class="sup"
            >5</span> Others, such as Theodore Roosevelt, thought the President to be capable, as a
         'steward' of the people, of exerting all power save that which is specifically prohibited
         by the Constitution or the Congress.<span class="sup">6</span> In my view&amp;#8212;taught
         me not only by the decision of Chief Justice Marshall in Little v. Barreme, 2 Cranch 170, 2
         L.Ed. 243, but also by a score of other pronouncements of distinguished members of this
         bench&amp;#8212;the Constitution does grant to the President extensive authority in times
         of grave and imperative national emergency. In fact, to my thinking, such a grant may well
         be necessary to the very existence of the Constitution itself. As Lincoln aptly said, '(is)
         it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the Constitution?'<span class="sup"
            >7</span> In describing this authority I care not whether one calls it 'residual,'
         'inherent,' 'moral, 'implied,' 'aggregate,? 'emergency,' or otherwise. I am of the
         conviction that those who have had the grantifying experience of being the President's
         lawyer have used one or more of these adjectives only with the utmost of sincerity and the
         highest of purpose.</p>


      <span class="num">390</span>
      <p>I conclude that where Congress has laid down specific procedures to deal with the type of
         crisis confronting the President, he must follow those procedures in meeting the crisis;
         but that in the absence of such action by Congress, the President's independent power to
         act depends upon the gravity of the situation contronting the nation. I cannot sustain the
         seizure in question because here, as in Little v. Barreme, 2 Crahch 170, 2 L.Ed. 243,
         Congfress had prescribed methods to be followed by the President in meeting the emergency
         at hand.</p>


      <span class="num">391</span>
      <p>Three statutory procecures were available: those provided in the Defense Production Act of
         1950, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, &amp;#167; 2061 et seq., the Labor Management Relations Act, 29
         U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 141 et seq., and the Selective Service Act of 1948, 50
         U.S.C.A.Appendix, &amp;#167; 451 et seq. In this case the President invoked the first of
         these procedures; he did not invoke the other two.</p>


      <span class="num">392</span>
      <p>The Defense Production Act of 1950 provides for mediation of labor disputes affecting
         national defense. Under this statutory authorization, the President has established the
         Wage Stabilization Board. The Defense Production Act, however, grants the President no
         power to seize real property except through ordinary condemnation proceedings, which were
         not used here, and creates no sanctions for the settlement of labor disputes.</p>


      <span class="num">393</span>
      <p>The Labor Management Relations Act, commonly known as the Taft-Hartley Act, includes
         provisions adopted for the purpose of dealing with nationwide strikes. They establish a
         procedure whereby the President may appoint a board of inquiry and thereafter, in proper
         cases, seek injunctive relief for an 80-day period against a threatened work stoppage. The
         President can invoke that procedure whenever, in his opinion, 'a threatened or actual
         strike * * * affecting an entire industry * * * will, if permitted to occur or to continue,
         imperil the national health or safety.'<span class="sup">8</span> At the time that Act was
         passed, Congress specifically rejected a proposal to empower the President to seize any
         'plant, mine, or facility' in which a threatened work stoppage would, in his judgment,
         'imperil the public health or security.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn9-2" id="fn9-2_ref"
            >9</a> Instead, the Taft-Hartley Act directed the President, in the event a strike had
         not been settled during the 80-day injunction period, to submit to Congress 'a full and
         comprehensive report * * * together with such recommendations as he may see fit to make for
         consideration and appropriate action.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn10-2" id="fn10-2_ref"
            >10</a> The legislative history of the Act demonstrates Congress' belief that the 80-day
         period would afford it adequate opportunity to determine whether special legislation should
         be enacted to meet the emergency at hand.<span class="sup">11</span>
      </p>


      <span class="num">394</span>
      <p>The Selective Service Act of 1948 gives the President specific authority to seize plants
         which fail to produce goods required by the armed forces or the Atomic Energy Commission
         for national defense purposes. The Act provides that when a producer from whom the
         President has ordered such goods 'refuses or fails' to fill the order within a period of
         time prescribed by the President, the President may take immediate possession of the
         producer's plant.<a class="footnote" href="#fn12-2" id="fn12-2_ref">12</a> This language is
         significantly broader than that used in the National Defense Act of 1916 and the Selective
         Training and Service Act of 1940, which provided for seizure when a producer 'refused' to
         supply essential defense materials, but not when he 'failed' to do so.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn13-2" id="fn13-2_ref">13</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">395</span>
      <p>These three statutes furnish the guideposts for decision in this case. Prior to seizing the
         steel mills on April 8 the President had exhausted the mediation procedures of the Defense
         Production Act through the Wage Stabilization Board. Use of those procedures had failed to
         avert the impending crisis; however, it had resulted in a 99-day postponement of the
         strike. The Government argues that this accomplished more than the maximum 80-day waiting
         period possible under the sanctions of the Taft-Hartley Act, and therefore amounted to
         compliance with the substance of that Act. Even if one were to accept this somewhat
         hyperbolic conclusion, the hard fact remains that neither the Defense Production Act nor
         Taft-Hartley authorized the seizure challenged here, and the Government made no effort to
         comply with the procedures established by the Selective Service Act of 1948, a statute
         which expressly authorizes seizures when producers fail to supply necessary defense mate
            riel.<a class="footnote" href="#fn14-2" id="fn14-2_ref">14</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">396</span>
      <p>For these reasons I concur in the judgment of the Court. As Justice Story once said: 'For
         the executive department of the government, this court entertain the most entire respect;
         and amidst the multiplicity of cares in that department, it may, without any violation of
         decorum, be presumed, that sometimes there may be an inaccurate construction of a law. It
         is our duty to expound the laws as we find them in the records of state; and we cannot,
         when called upon by the citizens of the country, refuse our opinion, however it may differ
         from that of very great authorities.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn15-2" id="fn15-2_ref"

      <span class="num">398</span>
      <p>The President of the United States directed the Secretary of Commerce to take temporary
         possession of the Nation's steel mills during the existing emergency because 'a work
         stoppage would immediately jeopardize and imperil our national defense and the defense of
         those joined with us in resisting aggression, and would add to the continuing danger of our
         soldiers, sailors and airmen engaged in combat in the field.' The District Court ordered
         the mills returned to their private owners on the ground that the President's acion was
         beyond his powers under the Constitution.</p>


      <span class="num">399</span>
      <p>This Court affirms. Some members of the Court are of the view that the President is without
         power to act in time of crisis in the absence of express statutory authorization. Other
         members of the Court affirm on the basis of their reading of certain statutes. Because we
         cannot agree that affirmance is proper on any ground, and because of the transcending
         importance of the questions presented not only in this critical litigation but also to the
         powers the President and of future Presidents to act in time of crisis, we are compelled to
         register this dissent.</p>

         peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the

         armed attack against one is an armed attack against all.<span class="sup">6</span> Congress
         immediately implemented the North Atlantic Treaty by authorizing military assistance to
         nations dedicated to the principles of mutual security under the United Nations
            Charter.<span class="sup">7</span> The concept of mutual security recently has been
         extended by treaty to friends in the Pacific.<span class="sup">8</span>
      </p>


      <span class="num">404</span>
      <p>Our treaties represent not merely legal obligations but show congressional recognition that
         mutual security for the free world is the best security against the threat of aggression on
         a global scale. The need for mutual security is shown by the very size of the armed forces
         outside the free world. Defendant's brief informs us that the Soviet Unin maintains the
         largest air force in the world and maintains g round forces much larger than those
         presently available to the United States and the countries joined with us in mutual
         security arrangements. Constant international tensions are cited to demonstrate how
         precarious is the peace.</p>


      <span class="num">405</span>
      <p>Even this brief review of our responsibilities in the world community discloses the
         enormity of our undertaking. Success of these measures may, as has often been observed,
         dramatically influence the lives of many generations of the world's peoples yet unborn.
         Alert to our responsibilities, which coincide with our own self preservation through mutual
         security, Congress has enacted a large body of implementing legislation. As an illustration
         of the magnitude of the over-all program, Congress has appropriated $130 billion for our
         own defense and for military assistance to our allies since the June, 1950, attack in
         Korea.</p>


      <span class="num">406</span>
      <p>In the Mutual Security Act of 1951, Congress authorized 'military, economic, and technical
         assistance to friendly countries to strengthen the mutual security and individual and
         collective defenses of the free world, * * *.'<span class="sup">9</span> Over $5 1/2
         billion were appropriated for military assistance for fiscal year 1952, the bulk of that
         amount to be devoted to purchase of military equipment.<span class="sup">10</span> A
         request for over $7 billion for the same purpose for fiscal year 1953 is currently pending
         in Congress.<span class="sup">11</span> In addition to direct shipment of military
         equipment to nations of the free world, defense production in those countries relies upon
         shipment of machine tools and allocation of steel tonnage from the United States.<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn12-3" id="fn12-3_ref">12</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">407</span>
      <p>Congress also directed the President to build up our own defenses. Congress, recognizing
         the 'grim fact * * * that the United States is now engaged in a struggle for survival' and
         that 'it is imperative that we now take those necessary steps to make our strength equal to
         the peril of the hour,' granted authority to draft men into the armed forces.<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn13-3" id="fn13-3_ref">13</a> As a result, we now have over
         3,500,000 men in our armed forces.<a class="footnote" href="#fn14-3" id="fn14-3_ref">14</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">408</span>
      <p>Appropriations for the Department of Defense, which had averaged less than $13 billion per
         year for the three years before attack in Korea, were increased by Congress to $48 billion
         for fiscal year 1951 and to $60 billion for fiscal year 1952.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn15-3" id="fn15-3_ref">15</a> A request for $51 billion for the Department of
         Defense for fiscal year 1953 is currently pending in Congress.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn16-2" id="fn16-2_ref">16</a> The bulk of the increase is for military equipment
         and supplies&amp;#8212;guns, tanks, ships, planes and ammunition&amp;#8212;all of which
         require steel. Other defense programs requiring great quantities of steel include the large
         scale expansion of facilities for the Atomic Energy Commission<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn17-2" id="fn17-2_ref">17</a> and the expansion of the Nation's productive
         capacity affirmatively encouraged by Congress.<a class="footnote" href="#fn18-2"
            id="fn18-2_ref">18</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">409</span>
      <p>Congress recognized the impact of these defense programs upon the economy. Following the
         attack in Korea, the President asked for authority to requisition property and to allocate
         and fix priorities for scarce goods. In the Defense Production Act of 1950, Congress
         granted the powers requested and, in addition, granted power to stabilize prices and wages
         and to provide for settlement of labor disputes arising in the defense program.<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn19-2" id="fn19-2_ref">19</a> The Defense Production Act was
         extended in 1951, a Senate Committee noting that in the dislocation caused by the programs
         for purchase of military equipment 'lies the seed of an economic disaster that might well
         destroy the military might we are straining to build.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn20-2"
            id="fn20-2_ref">20</a> Significantly, the Committee examined the problem 'in terms of
         just one commodity, steel,' and found 'a graphic picture of the over-all inflationary
         danger growing out of reduced civilian supplies and rising incomes.' Even before Korea,
         steel production at levels above theoretical 100% capacity was not capable of supplying
         civilian needs alone. Since Korea, the tremendous military demand for steel has far
         exceeded the increases in productive capacity. This Committee emphasized that the shortage
         of steel, even with the mills operating at full capacity, coupled with increased civilian
         purchasing power, presented grave danger of disastrous inflation.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn21-1" id="fn21-1_ref">21</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">410</span>
      <p>The President has the duty to execute the foregoing legislative programs. Their successful
         execution depends upon continued production of steel and stabilized prices for steel.
         Accordingly, when the collective bargaining agreements between the Nation's steel producers
         and their employees, represented by the United Steel Workers, were due to expire on
         December 31, 1951, and a strike shutting down the entire basic steel industry was
         threatened, the President acted to avert a complete shutdown of steel production. On
         December 22, 1951, he certified the dispute to the Wage Stabilization Board, requesting
         that the Board investigate the dispute and promptly report its recommendation as to fair
         and equitable terms of settlement. The Union complied with the President's request and
         delayed its threatened strike while the dispute was before the Board. After a special Board
         panel had conducted hearings and submitted a report, the full Wage Stabilization Board
         submitted its report and recommendations to the President on March 20, 1952.</p>


      <span class="num">411</span>
      <p>The Board's report was acceptable to the Union but was rejected by plaintiffs. The Union
         gave notice of its intention to strike as of 12:01 a.m., April 9, 1952, but bargaining
         between the parties continued with hope of settlement until the evening of April 8, 1952.
         After bargaining had failed to avert the threatened shutdown of steel production, the
         President issued the following Executive Order:</p>


      <span class="num">412</span>
      <p>'Whereas on December 16, 1950, I proclaimed the existence of a national emergency which
         requires that the military, naval, air, and civilian defenses of this country be
         strengthened as speedily as possible to the end that we may be able to repel any and all
         threats against our national security and to fulfill our responsibilities in the efforts
         being made throughout the United Nations and otherwise to bring about a lasting peace;
         and</p>


      <span class="num">413</span>
      <p>'Whereas American fighting men and fighting men of other nations of the United Nations are
         now engaged in deadly combat with the forces of aggression in Korea, and forces of the
         United States are stationed elsewhere overseas for the purpose of participating in the
         defense of the Atlantic Community against aggression; and</p>


      <span class="num">414</span>
      <p>'Whereas the weapons and other materials needed by our armed forces and by those joined
         with us in the defense of the free world are produced to a great extent in this country,
         and steel is an indispensable component of substantially all of such weapons and materials;
         and 'Whereas steel is likewise indispenable to the carrying out of programs of the Atomic
         Energy Comm ission of vital importance to our defense efforts; and</p>


      <span class="num">415</span>
      <p>'Whereas a continuing and uninterrupted supply of steel is also indispensable to the
         maintenance of the economy of the United States, upon which our military strength depends;
         and</p>


      <span class="num">416</span>
      <p>'Whereas a controversy has arisen between certain companies in the United States producing
         and fabricating steel and the elements thereof and certain of their workers represented by
         the United Steel Workers of America, CIO, regarding terms and conditions of employment;
         and</p>


      <span class="num">417</span>
      <p>'Whereas the controversy has not been settled through the processes of collective
         bargaining or through the efforts of the Government, including those of the Wage
         Stabilization Board, to which the controversy was referred on December 22, 1951, pursuant
         to Executive Order No. 10233, and a strike has been called for 12:01 A.M., April 9, 1952;
         and</p>


      <span class="num">418</span>
      <p>'Whereas a work stoppage would immediately jeopardize and imperil our national defense and
         the defense of those joined with us in resisting aggression, and would add to the
         continuing danger of our soldiers, sailors, and airmen engaged in combat in the field;
         and</p>


      <span class="num">419</span>
      <p>'Whereas in order to assure the continued availability of steel and steel products during
         the existing emergency, it is necessary that the United States take possession of and
         operate the plants, facilities, and other property of the said companies as hereinafter
         provided:</p>


      <span class="num">420</span>
      <p>'Now, Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of
         the United States, and as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the
         armed forces of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>


      <span class="num">421</span>
      <p>'1. The Secretary of Commerce is hereby authorized and directed to take possession of all
         or such of the plants, facilities, and other property of the companies named in the list
         attached hereto, or any part thereof, as he may deem necessary in the interests of national
         defense; and to operate or to arrange for the operation thereof and to do all things
         necessary for, or incidental to, such operation * * *.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn22-1"
            id="fn22-1_ref">22</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">422</span>
      <p>The next morning, April 9, 1952, the President addressed the following Message to
         Congress:</p>


      <span class="num">423</span>
      <p>'To the Congress of the United States:</p>


      <span class="num">424</span>
      <p>'The Congress is undoubtedly aware of the recent events which have taken place in
         connection with the management-labor dispute in the steel industry. These events culminated
         in the action which was taken last night to provide for temporary operation of the steel
         mills by the Government.</p>


      <span class="num">425</span>
      <p>'I took this action with the utmost reluctance. The idea of Government operation of the
         steel mills is thoroughly distasteful to me and I want to see it ended as soon as possible.
         However, in the situation which confronted me yesterday, I felt that I could make no other
         choice. The other alternatives appeared to be even worse&amp;#8212;so much worse that I
         could not accept them.</p>


      <span class="num">426</span>
      <p>'One alternative would have been to permit a shut-down in the steel industry. The effects
         of such a shut-down would have been so immediate and damaging with respect to our efforts
         to support our Armed Forces and to protect our national security that it made this
         alternative unthinkable.</p>


      <span class="num">427</span>
      <p>'The only way that I know of, other than Government operation, by which a steel shut-down
         could have been avoided was to grant the demands of the steel industry for a large price
         increase. I believed and the officials in charge of our stabilization agencies believed
         that this would have wrecked our stabilization program. I was unwilling to accept the
         incalculable damage which might be done to our country by following such a course.</p>


      <span class="num">428</span>
      <p>'Accordingly, it was my judgment that Government operation of the steel mills for a
         temporary period was the least undesirable of the courses of action which lay open. In the
         circumstances, I believed it to be, and now believe it to be, my duty and within my powers
         as President to follow that courseof action.</p>


      <span class="num">429</span>
      <p>'It may be that the Congress will deem some othe r course to be wiser. It may be that the
         Congress will feel we should give in to the demands of the steel industry for an exorbitant
         price increase and take the consequences so far as resulting inflation is concerned.</p>


      <span class="num">430</span>
      <p>'It may be that the Congress will feel the Government should try to force the steel workers
         to continue to work for the steel companies for another long period, without a contract,
         even though the steel workers have already voluntarily remained at work without a contract
         for 100 days in an effort to reach an orderly settlement of their differences with
         management.</p>


      <span class="num">431</span>
      <p>'It may even be that the Congress will feel that we should permit a shutdown of the steel
         industry, although that would immediately endanger the safety of our fighting forces abroad
         and weaken the whole structure of our national security.</p>


      <span class="num">432</span>
      <p>'I do not believe the Congress will favor any of these courses of action, but that is a
         matter for the Congress to determine.</p>


      <span class="num">433</span>
      <p>'It may be, on the other hand, that the Congress will wish to pass legislation establishing
         specific terms and conditions with reference to the operation of the steel mills by the
         Government. Sound legislation of this character might be very desirable.</p>


      <span class="num">434</span>
      <p>'On the basis of the facts that are known to me at this time, I do not believe that
         immediate congressional action is essential; but I would, of course, be glad to cooperate
         in developing any legislative proposals which the Congress may wish to consider.</p>


      <span class="num">435</span>
      <p>'If the Congress does not deem it necessary to act at this time, I shall continue to do all
         that is within my power to keep the steel industry operating and at the same time make
         every effort to bring about a settlement of the dispute so the mills can be returned to
         their private owners as soon as possible.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn23-1"
            id="fn23-1_ref">23</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">436</span>
      <p>Twelve days passed without action by Congress. On April 21, 1952, the President sent a
         letter to the President of the Senate in which he again described the purpose and need for
         his action and again stated his position that 'The Congress can, if it wishes, reject the
         course of action I have followed in this matter.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn24-1"
            id="fn24-1_ref">24</a> Congress has not so acted to this date.</p>


      <span class="num">437</span>
      <p>Meanwhile, plaintiffs instituted this action in the District Court to compel defendant to
         return possession of the steel mills seized under Executive Order 10340. In this litigation
         for return of plaintiffs' properties, we assume that defendant Charles Sawyer is not immune
         from judicial restraint and that plaintiffs are entitled to equitable relief if we find
         that the Executive Order under which defendant acts is unconstitutional. We also assume
         without deciding that the courts may go behind a President'sfinding of fact that an
         emergency exists. But there is not the slightest basis for suggesting that the President's
         finding in this case can be undermined. Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction
         before answer or hearing. Defendant opposed the motion, filing uncontroverted affidavits of
         Government officials describing the facts underlying the President's order.</p>


      <span class="num">438</span>
      <p>Secretary of Defense Lovett swore that 'a work stoppage in the steel industry will result
         immediately in serious curtailment of production of essential weapons and munitions of all
         kinds.' He illustrated by showing that 84% of the national production of certain alloy
         steel is currently used for production of military-end items and that 35% of total
         production of another form of steel goes into ammunition, 80% of such ammunition now going
         to Korea. The Secretary of Defense stated that: 'We are holding the line (in Korea) with
         ammunition and not with the lives of our troops.'</p>


      <span class="num">439</span>
      <p>Affidavits of the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, the Secretary of the Interior,
         defendant as Secretary of Commerce, and the Administrators of the Defense Production
         Administration, the National Production Authority, the General Servies Administration and
         the Defense Transport Administration wer e also filed in the District Court. These
         affidavits disclose an enormous demand for steel in such vital defense programs as the
         expansion of facilities in atomic energy, petroleum, power, transportation and industrial
         production, including steel production. Those charged with administering allocations and
         priorities swore to the vital part steel production plays in our economy. The affidavits
         emphasize the critical need for steel in our defense program, the absence of appreciable
         inventories of steel, and the drastic results of any interruption in steel production.</p>


      <span class="num">440</span>
      <p>One is not here called upon even to consider the possibility of executive seizure of a
         farm, a corner grocery store or even a single industrial plant. Such considerations arise
         only when one ignores the central fact of this case&amp;#8212;that the Nation's entire
         basic steel production would have shut down completely if there had been no Government
         seizure. Even ignoring for the moment whatever confidential information the President may
         possess as 'the Nation's organ for foreign affairs,'<a class="footnote" href="#fn25-1"
            id="fn25-1_ref">25</a> the uncontroverted affidavits in this record amply support the
         finding that 'a work stoppage would immediately jeopardize and imperil our national
         defense.'</p>


      <span class="num">441</span>
      <p>Plaintiffs do not remotely suggest any basis for rejecting the President's finding that any
         stoppage of steel production would immediately place the Nation in peril. Moreover, even
         self-generated doubts that any stoppage of steel production constitutes an emergency are of
         little comfort here. The Union and the plaintiffs bargained for 6 months with over 100
         issues in dispute&amp;#8212;issues not limited to wage demands but including the union shop
         and other matters of principle between the parties. At the time of seizure there was not,
         and there is not now, the slightest evidence to justify the belief that any strike will be
         of short duration. The Union and the steel companies may well engage in a lengthy struggle.
         Plaintiff's counsel tells us that 'sooner or later' the mills will operate again. That May
         satisfy the steel companies and, perhaps, the Union. But our soldiers and our allies will
         hardly be cheered with the assurance that the ammunition upon which their lives depend will
         be forthcoming&amp;#8212;'sooner or later,' or, in other words, 'too little and too late.'
         Accordingly, if the President has any power under the Constitution to meet a critical
         situation in the absence of express statutory authorization, there is no basis whatever for
         criticizing the exercise of such power in this case.</p>

      <p>II.</p>

      <span class="num">442</span>
      <p>The steel mills were seized for a public use. The power of eminent domain, invoked in that
         case, is an essential attribute of sovereignty and has long been recognized as a power of
         the Federal Government. Kohl v. United States, 1876, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/svL/kohl-v-united-states/">
               <span class="volume">91</span>
               <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
               <span class="page">367</span>
            </a>
         </span>, 23 L.Ed. 449. Plaintiffs cannot complain that any provision in the Constitution
         prohibits the exercise of the power of eminent domain in this case. The Fifth Amendment
         provides: 'nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.'
         It is no bar to this seizure for, if the taking is not otherwise unlawful, plaintiffs are
         assured of receiving the required just compensation. United States v. Pewee Coal Co., 1951,
            <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/xbv/united-states-v-pewee-coal-co-inc/">
               <span class="volume">341</span>
               <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
               <span class="page">114</span>
            </a>
         </span>, 71 S.Ct. 670, 95 L.Ed. 809.</p>


      <span class="num">443</span>
      <p>Admitting that the Government could seize the mills, plaintiffs claim that the implied
         power of eminent domain can be exercised only under an Act of Congress; under no
         circumstances, they say, can that power be exercised by the President unless he can point
         to an express provision in enabling legislation. This was the view adopted by the District
         Judge when he granted the preliminary injunction. Without an answer, without hearing
         evidence, he determined the issue on the basis of his 'fixed conclusion * * * that
         defendant's acts are illegal' because the President's only course in the face of an
         emergency is to pr esent the matter to Congress and await the final passage of legislation
         which will enable the Government to cope with threatened disaster.</p>


      <span class="num">444</span>
      <p>Under this view, the President is left powerless at the very moment when the need for
         action may be most pressing and when no one, other than he, is immediately capable of
         action. Under this view, he is left powerless because a power not expressly given to
         Congress is nevertheless found to rest exclusively with Congress.</p>

      <p>Consideration of this view of executive impotence calls for further examination of the
         nature of the separation of powers under our tripartite system of Government.</p>

      <p>The Constitution provides:</p>

      <p>Section 2. 'The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United

         provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; * * *.'</p>


      <span class="num">452</span>
      <p>Section 3. 'He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the
         Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and
         expedient; * * * he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, * * *.'</p>


      <span class="num">453</span>
      <p>Art. III,</p>


      <span class="num">454</span>
      <p>Section 1. 'The judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme Court,
         and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and
         establish.'</p>


      <span class="num">455</span>
      <p>The whole of the 'executive Power' is vested in the President. Before entering office, the
         President swears that he 'will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United
         States, and will to the best of (his) Ability, preserve, protect and defend the
         Constitution of the United States.' Art. II, &amp;#167; 1.</p>


      <span class="num">456</span>
      <p>This comprehensive grant of the executive power to a single person was bestowed soon after
         the country had thrown the yoke of monarchy. Only by instilling initiative and vigor in all
         of the three departments of Government, declared Madison, could tyranny in any from be
            avoided.<a class="footnote" href="#fn26-1" id="fn26-1_ref">26</a> Hamilton added:
         'Energy in the Executive is a leading character in the definition of good government. It is
         essential to the protection of the community against foreign attack; it is not less
         essential to the steady administration of the laws; to the protection of property against
         those irregular and highhanded combinations which sometimes interrupt the ordinary course
         of justice; to the security of liberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition, of
         faction, and of anarchy.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn27-1" id="fn27-1_ref">27</a> It is
         thus apparent that the Presidency was deliberately fashioned as an office of power and
         independence. Of course, the Framers created no autocrat capable of arrogating any power
         unto himself at any time. But neither did they create an automaton impotent to exercise the
         powers of Government at a time when the survival of the Republic itself may be at
         stake.</p>


      <span class="num">457</span>
      <p>In passing upon the grave constitutional question presented in this case, we must never
         forget, as Chief Justice Marshall admonished, that the Constitution is 'intended to endure
         for ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs,'
         and that '(i)ts means are adequate to its ends.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn28"
            id="fn28_ref">28</a> Cases do arise presenting questions which could not have been
         foreseen by the Framers. In such cases, the Constitution has been treated as a living
         document adaptable to new situations.<a class="footnote" href="#fn29" id="fn29_ref">29</a>
         But we are not called upon today to expand the Constitution to meet a new situation. For,
         in this case, we need only look to history and time-honored principles of constitutional
         law&amp;#8212;principles that have been applied consistently by all branches of the
         Government thrughout our history. It is those who assert the invalidity of t he Executive
         Order who seek to amend the Constitution in this case.</p>

      <p>III.</p>

      <span class="num">458</span>
      <p>A review of executive action demonstrates that our Presidents have on many occasions
         exhibited the leadership contemplated by the Framers when they made the President Commander
         in Chief, and imposed upon him the trust to 'take Care that the Laws be faithfully
         executed.' With or without explicit statutory authorization, Presidents have at such times
         dealt with national emergencies by acting promptly and resolutely to enforce legislative
         programs, at least to save those programs until Congress could act. Congress and the courts
         have responded to such executive initiative with consistent approval.</p>


      <span class="num">459</span>
      <p>Our first President displayed at once the leadership contemplated by the Framers. When the
         national revenue laws were openly flouted in some sections of Pennsylvania, President
         Washington, without waiting for a call from the state government, summoned the militia and
         took decisive steps to secure the faithful execution of the laws.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn30" id="fn30_ref">30</a> When international disputes engendered by the French
         revolution threatened to involve this country in war, and while congressional policy
         remained undertain, Washington issued his Proclamation of Neutrality. Hamilton, whose
         defense of the Proclamation has endured the test of time, invoked the argument that the
         Executive has the duty to do that which will preserve peace until Congress acts and, in
         addition, pointed to the need for keeping the Nation informed of the requirements of
         existing laws and treaties as part of the faithful execution of the laws.<a

      <span class="num">460</span>
      <p>President John Adams issued a warrant for the arrest of Jonathan Robbins in order to
         execute the extradition provisions of a treaty. This action was challenged in Congress on
         the ground that no specific statute prescribed the method to be used in executing the
         treaty. John Marshall, then a member of the House of Representatives, made the following
         argument in support of the President's action:</p>


      <span class="num">461</span>
      <p>'The treaty, which is a law, enjoins the performance of a particular object. The person who
         is to perform this object is marked out by the Constitution, since the person is named who
         conducts the foreign intercourse, and is to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.
         The means by which it is to be performed, the force of the nation, are in the hands of this
         person. Ought not this person to perform the object, although the particular mode of using
         the means has not been prescribed? Congress, unquestionably may prescribe the mode, and
         Congress may devolve on others the whole execution of the contract; but, till this be done,
         it seems the duty of the Executive department to execute the contract by any means it
            possesses.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn32" id="fn32_ref">32</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">462</span>
      <p>Efforts in Congress to discredit the President for his action failed.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn33" id="fn33_ref">33</a> Almost a century later, this Court had occasion to
         give its express approval to 'the masterly and conclusive argument of John Marshall.'<a

      <p>Jefferson's initiative in the Louisiana Purchase, the Monroe Doctrine, and Jackson's
         removal of Government deposits from the Bank of the United States further serve to

         executive power in the President.</p>

      <p>Without declaration of war, President Lincoln took energetic action with the outreak of the
         War Between the States. He summoned troops and pai d them out of the Treasury without
         appropriation therefor. He proclaimed a naval blockade of the Confederacy and seized ships
         violating that blockade. Congress, far from denying the validity of these acts, gave them
         express approval. The most striking action of President Lincoln was the Emancipation
         Proclamation, issued in aid of the successful prosecution of the War Between the States,
         but wholly without statutory authority.<a class="footnote" href="#fn35" id="fn35_ref"

      <span class="num">465</span>
      <p>In an action furnishing a most apt precedent for this case, President Lincoln without
         statutory authority directed the seizure of rail and telegraph lines leading to
            Washington.<a class="footnote" href="#fn36" id="fn36_ref">36</a> Many months later,
         Congress recognized and confirmed the power of the President to seize railroads and
         telegraph lines and provided criminal penalties for interference with Government
            operation.<a class="footnote" href="#fn37" id="fn37_ref">37</a> This Act did not confer
         on the President any additional powers of seizure. Congress plainly rejected the view that
         the President's acts had been without legal sanction until ratified by the legislature.
         Sponsors of the bill declared that its purpose was only to confirm the power which the
         President already possessed.<a class="footnote" href="#fn38" id="fn38_ref">38</a> Opponents
         insisted a statute authorizing seizure was unnecessary and might even be construed as
         limiting existing Presidential powers.<a class="footnote" href="#fn39" id="fn39_ref">39</a>

      <p>'Extraordinary and unforeseen occasions arise, however, beyond all doubt, in cases of
         extreme necessity in time of war or of immediate and impending public danger, in which

         the emergency must be shown to exist before the taking can be justified. Such a
         justification may be shown, and when shown the rule is well settled that the officer taking
         private property for such a purpose, if the emergency is fully proved, is not a trespasser,

         </span>, 424 (4 L.Ed. 579)), and it is rational to assume that its active forces will be
         found equal in most things to the emergencies that confront it. While perfect flexibility
         is not to be expected in a Government of divided powers, and while division of power is one
         of the principal features of the Constitution, it is the plain duty of those who are called
         upon to draw the dividing lines to ascertain the essential, recognize the practical, and
         avoid a slavish formalism which can only serve to ossify the Government and reduce its
         efficiency without any compensating good. The function of making laws is peculiar to
         Congress, and the Executive can not exercise that function to any degree. But this is not
         to say that all of the subjects concerning which laws might be made are perforce removed
         from the possibility of Executive influence. The Executive may act upon things and upon men
         in many relations which have not, though they might have, been actually regulated by
         Congress. In other words, just as there are fields which are peculiar to Congress and
         fields which are peculiar to the Executive, so there are fields which are common to both,
         in the sense that the Executive may move within them until they shall have been occupied by
         legislative action. These are not the fields of legislative prerogative, but fields within
         which the lawmaking power may enter and dominate whenever it chooses. This situation
         results from the fact that the President is the active agent, not of Congress, but of the
         Nation. As such he performs the duties which the Constitution lays upon him immediately,
         and as such, also, he executes the laws and regulations adopted by Congress. He is the
         agent of the people of the United States, deriving all his powers from them and responsible
         directly to them. In no sense is he the agent of Congress. He obeys and executes the laws
         of Congress, not because Congress is enthroned in authority over him, but because the
         Constitution directs him to do so.</p>


      <span class="num">477</span>
      <p>'Therefore it follows that in ways short of making laws or disobeying them, the Executive
         may be under a grave constitutional duty to act for the national protection in situations
         not covered by the acts of Congress, and in which, even, it may not be said that his action
         is the direct expression of any particular one of the independent powers which are granted
         to him specifically by the Constitution. Instances wherein the President has felt and
         fulfilled such a duty have not been rare in our history, though, being for the public
         benefit and approved by all, his acts have seldom been challenged in the courts. We are
         able, however, to present a number of apposite cases which were subjected to judicial
         inquiry.'</p>

      <p>'As we understand the doctrine of the Neagle case, and the cases therein citd, it is
         clearly this: The Executive is authorized to exert th e power of the United States when he
         finds this necessary for the protection of the agencies, the instrumentalities, or the
         property of the Government. This does not mean an authority to disregard the wishes of
         Congress on the subject, when that subject lies within its control and when those wishes
         have been expressed, and it certainly does not involve the slightest semblance of a power
         to legislate, much less to 'suspend' legislation already passed by Congress. It involves
         the performance of specific acts, not of a legislative but purely of an executive
         character&amp;#8212;acts which are not in themselves laws, but which presuppose a 'law'
         authorizing him to perform them. This law is not expressed, either in the Constitution or
         in the enactments of Congress, but reason and necessity compel that it be implied from the
         exigencies of the situation.</p>


      <span class="num">480</span>
      <p>'In none of the cases which we have mentioned, nor in the cases cited in the extracts taken
         from the Neagle case, was it possible to say that the action of the President was directed,
         expressly or impliedly, by Congress. The situations dealt with had never been covered by
         any act of Congress, and there was no ground whatever for a contention that the possibility
         of their occurrence had ever been specifically considered by the legislative mind. In none
         of those cases did the action of the President amount merely to the execution of some
         specific law.</p>


      <span class="num">481</span>
      <p>'Neither does any of them stand apart in principle from the case at bar, as involving the
         exercise of specific constitutional powers of the President in a degree in which this case
         does not involve them. Taken collectively, the provisions of the Constitution which
         designate the President as the official who must represent us in foreign relations, in
         commanding the Army and Navy, in keeping Congress informed of the state of the Union, in
         insuring the faithful execution of the laws and in recommending new ones, considered in
         connection with the sweeping declaration that the executive power shall be vested in him,
         completely demonstrate that his is the watchful eye, the active hand, the overseeing
         dynamic force of the United States.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn49" id="fn49_ref">49</a>

      <p>This brief is valuable not alone because of the caliber of its authors but because it lays

      <p>During World War I, President Wilson established a War Labor Board without awaiting
         specific direction by Congress.<a class="footnote" href="#fn50" id="fn50_ref">50</a> With
         William Howard Taft and Frank P. Walsh as co-chairmen, the Board had as its purpose the
         prevention of strikes and lockouts interfering with the production of goods needed to meet
         the emergency. Effectiveness of War Labor Board decision was accomplished by Presidental
         action, including seizure of industrial plants.<a class="footnote" href="#fn51"
            id="fn51_ref">51</a> Seizure of the Nation's railroads was also ordered by President
            Wilson.<a class="footnote" href="#fn52" id="fn52_ref">52</a>

      <p>Beginning with the Bank Holiday Proclamation<a class="footnote" href="#fn53" id="fn53_ref"
            >53</a> and continuing through World War II, executive leadership and intiative were
         characteristic of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration. In 1939, upon the
         outbreak of war in Europe, the President proclaimed a limited national emergency for the
         purpose of strengthening our national defense.<a class="footnote" href="#fn54"
            id="fn54_ref">54</a> By May of 1941, the danger from the Axis belligerents having become
         clear, the President proclaimed 'an unlimited national emergency' calling for mobilization
         of the Nation's defenses to repel aggression.<a class="footnote" href="#fn55" id="fn55_ref"
            >55</a> The President took the initiative in strengthening our defenses by acquiring
         rights from the British Government to establish air bases in exchange for overage
            destroyers.<a class="footnote" href="#fn56" id="fn56_ref">56</a>

      <p>In 1941, President Roosevelt acted to protect Iceland from attack by Axis powers when
         British forces were withdrawn by sending our forces to occupy Iceland. Congress was
         informed of this action on the same day that our forces reached Iceland.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn57" id="fn57_ref">57</a> The occupation of Iceland was but one of 'at least 125
         incidents' in our history in which Presidents, 'without Congressinal authorization, and in
         the absence of a declaration of war, (have) ordered the Armed Forces to take action or
         maintain positions abroad.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn58" id="fn58_ref">58</a>

      <span class="num">486</span>
      <p>Some six months before Pearl Harbor, a dispute at a single aviation plant at Inglewood,
         California, interrupted a segment of the production of military aircraft. In spite of the
         comparative insignificance of this work stoppage to total defense production as contrasted
         with the complete paralysis now threatened by a shutdown of the entire basic steel
         industry, and even though our armed forces were not then engaged in combat, President
         Roosevelt ordered the seizure of the plant 'pursuant to the powers vested in (him) by the
         Constitution and laws of the United States, as President of the United States of America
         and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States.'<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn59" id="fn59_ref">59</a> The Attorney General (Jackson) vigorously proclaimed
         that the President had the moral duty to keep this Nation's defense effort a 'going
         concern.' His ringing moral justification was coupled with a legal justification equally
         well stated:</p>


      <span class="num">487</span>
      <p>'The Presidential proclamation rests upon the aggregate of the Presidential powers derived
         from the Constitution itself and from statutes enacted by the Congress.</p>


      <span class="num">488</span>
      <p>'The Constitution lays upon the President the duty 'to take care that the laws be
         faithfully executed.' Among the laws which he is required to find means to execute are
         those which direct him to equip an enlarged army, to provide for a strengthened navy, to
         protect Government property, to protect those who are engaged in carrying out the business
         of the Government, and to carry out the provisions of the Lend-Lease Act (22 U.S.C.A.
         &amp;#167; 411 et seq.). For the faithful execution of such laws the President has back of
         him not only each general law-enforcement power conferred by the various acts of Congress
         but the aggregate of all such laws plus that wide discretion as to method vested in him by
         the Constitution for the purpose of executing the laws.</p>


      <span class="num">489</span>
      <p>'The Constititution als places on the President the responsibility and vests in him t he
         powers of Commander in Chief of the Army and of the Navy. These weapons for the protection
         of the continued existence of the Nation are placed in his sole command and the implication
         is clear that he should not allow them to become paralyzed by failure to obtain supplies
         for which Congress has appropriated the money and which it has directed the President to
            obtain.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn60" id="fn60_ref">60</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">490</span>
      <p>At this time, Senator Connally proposed amending the Selective Service and Training Act to
         authorize the President to seize any plant where an interruption of production would unduly
         impede the defense effort.<a class="footnote" href="#fn61" id="fn61_ref">61</a> Proponents
         of the measure in no way implied that the legislation would add to the powers already
         possessed by the President<a class="footnote" href="#fn62" id="fn62_ref">62</a> and the
         amendment was opposed as unnecessary since the President already had the power.<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn63" id="fn63_ref">63</a> The amendment relating to plant
         seizures was not approved at that session of Congress.<a class="footnote" href="#fn64"
            id="fn64_ref">64</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">491</span>
      <p>Meanwhile, and also prior to Pearl Harbor, the President ordered the seizure of a
         shipbuilding company and an aircraft parts plant.<a class="footnote" href="#fn65"
            id="fn65_ref">65</a> Following the declaration of war, but prior to the Smith-Connally
         Act of 1943, five additional industrial concerns were seized to avert interruption of
         needed production.<a class="footnote" href="#fn66" id="fn66_ref">66</a> During the same
         period, the President directed seizure of the Nation's coal mines to remove an obstruction
         to the effective prosecution of the war.<a class="footnote" href="#fn67" id="fn67_ref"
            >67</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">492</span>
      <p>The procedures adopted by President Roosevelt closely resembled the methods employed by
         President Wilson. A National War Labor Board, like its predecessor of World War I, was
         created by Executive Order to deal effectively and fairly with disputes affecting defense
            production.<a class="footnote" href="#fn68" id="fn68_ref">68</a> Seizures were
         considered necessary, upon disobedience of War Labor Board orders, to assure that the
         mobilization effort remained a 'going concern,' and to enforce the economic stabilization
         program.</p>


      <span class="num">493</span>
      <p>At the time of the seizure of the coal mines, Senator Connally's bill to provide a
         statutory basis for seizures and for the War Labor Board was again before Congress. As
         stated by its sponsor, the purpose of the bill was not to augment Presidential power, but
         to 'let the country know that the Congress is squarely behind the President.'<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn69" id="fn69_ref">69</a> As in the case of the legislative
         recognition of President Lincoln's power to seize, Congress again recognized that the
         President already had the necessary power, for there was no intention to 'ratify' past
         actions of doubtful validity. Indeed, when Senator Tydings offered an amendment to the
         Connally bill expressly to confirm and validate the seizure of the coal mines, sponsors of
         the bill opposed the amendment as casting doubt on the legality of the seizure and the
         amendmentwas defeated.<a class="footnote" href="#fn70" id="fn70_ref">70</a> When the
         Connally bill, S. 796, came befo re the House, all parts after the enacting clause were
         stricken and a bill introduced by Representative Smith of Virginia was substituted and
         passed. This action in the House is significant because the Smith bill did not contain the
         provisions authorizing seizure by the President but did contain provisions controlling and
         regulating activities in respect to properties seized by the Government under statute 'or
            otherwise.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn71" id="fn71_ref">71</a> After a conference, the
         seizure provisions of the Connally bill, enacted as the Smith-Connally or War Labor
         Disputes Act of 1943, 57 Stat. 163, were agreed to by the House.</p>


      <span class="num">494</span>
      <p>Following passage of the Smith-Connally Act, seizures to assure continued production on the
         basis of terms recommended by the War Labor Board were based upon that Act as well as upon
         the President's power under the Constitution and the laws generally. A question did arise
         as to whether the statutory language relating to 'any plant, mine, or facility equipped for
         the manufacture, production, or mining of any articles or materials'<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn72" id="fn72_ref">72</a> authorized the seizure of properties of Montgomery
         Ward &amp;amp; Co., a retail department store and mail order concern. The Attorney General
         (Biddle) issued an opinion that the President possessed the power to seize Montgomery Ward
         properties to prevent a work stoppage whether or not the terms of the Smith-Connally Act
         authorized such a seizure.<a class="footnote" href="#fn73" id="fn73_ref">73</a> This
         opinion was in line with the views on Presidential powers maintained by the Attorney
         General's predecessors (Murphy<a class="footnote" href="#fn74" id="fn74_ref">74</a> and
            Jackson<a class="footnote" href="#fn75" id="fn75_ref">75</a>) and his successor (Clark<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn76" id="fn76_ref">76</a>). Accordingly, the President ordered
         seizure of the Chicago properties of Montgomery Ward in April, 1944, when that company
         refused to obey a War Labor Board order concerning the bargaining represenative of its
         employees in Chicago.<a class="footnote" href="#fn77" id="fn77_ref">77</a> In Congress, a
         Select Commitee to Investigate Seizure of the Property of Montgomery Ward &amp;amp; Co.,
         assuming that the terms of the Smith-Connally Act did not cover this seizure, concluded
         that the seizure 'was not only within the Constitutional power but was the plain duty of
         the President.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn78" id="fn78_ref">78</a> Thereafter, an
         election determined the bargaining representative for the Chicago employees and the
         properties were returned to Montgomery Ward &amp;amp; Co. In December, 1944, after
         continued defiance of a series of War Labor Board orders, President Roosevelt ordered the
         seizure of Montgomery Ward properties throughout the country.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn79" id="fn79_ref">79</a> The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld
         this seizure on statutory grounds and also indicated its disapproval of a lower court's
         denial of seizure power apart from express statute.<a class="footnote" href="#fn80"
            id="fn80_ref">80</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">495</span>
      <p>More recently,President Truman acted to repel aggression by employing our ar med forces in
            Korea.<a class="footnote" href="#fn81" id="fn81_ref">81</a> Upon the intervention of the
         Chinese Communists, the President proclaimed the existence of an unlimited national
         emergency requiring the speedy build-up of our defense establishment.<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn82" id="fn82_ref">82</a> Congress responded by providing for increased manpower
         and weapons for our own armed forces, by increasing military aid under the Mutual Security
         Program and by enacting economic stabilization measures, as previously described.</p>


      <span class="num">496</span>
      <p>This is but a cursory summary of executive leadership. But it amply demonstrates that
         Presidents have taken prompt action to enforce the laws and protect the country whether or
         not Congress happened to provide in advance for the particular method of execution. At the
         minimum, the executive actions reviewed herein sustain the action of the President in this
         case. And many of the cited examples of Presidential practice go far beyond the extent of
         power necessary to sustain the President's order to seize the steel mills. The fact that
         temporary executive seizures of industrial plants to meet an emergency have not been
         directly tested in this Court furnishes not the slightest suggestion that such actions have
         been illegal. Rather, the fact that Congress and the courts have consistently recognized
         and given their support to such executive action indicates that such a power of seizure has
         been accepted throughout our history.</p>


      <span class="num">497</span>
      <p>History bears out the genius of the Founding Fathers, who created a Government subject to
         law but not left subject to inertia when vigor and initiative are required.</p>

      <p>IV.</p>

      <span class="num">498</span>
      <p>Focusing now on the situation confronting the President on the night of April 8, 1952, we
         cannot but conclude that the President was performing his duty under the Constitution to
         'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed'&amp;#8212;a duty described by President
         Benjamin Harrison as 'the central idea of the office.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn83"
            id="fn83_ref">83</a>
      </p>


      <span class="num">499</span>
      <p>The President reported to Congress the morning after the seizure that he acted because a
         work stoppage in steel production would immediately imperil the safety of the Nation by
         preventing execution of the legislative programs for procurement of military equipment.
         And, while a shutdown could be averted by granting the price concessions requested by
         plaintiffs, granting such concessions would disrupt the price stabilization program also
         enacted by Congress. Rather than fail to execute either legislative program, the President
         acted to execute both.</p>


      <span class="num">500</span>
      <p>Much of the argument in this case has been directed at straw men. We do not now have before
         us the case of a President acting solely on the basis of his own notions of the public
         welfare. Nor is there any question of unlimited executive power in this case. The President
         himself closed the door to any such claim when he sent his Message to Congress stating his
         purpose to abide by any action of Congress, whether approving or disapproving his seizure
         action. Here, the President immediately made sure that Congress was fully informed of the
         temporary action he had taken only to preserve the legislative programs from destruction
         until Congress could act.</p>


      <span class="num">501</span>
      <p>The absence of a specific statute authorizing seizure of the steel mills as a mode of
         executing the laws&amp;#8212;both the military procurement program and the anti-inflation
         program&amp;#8212;has not until today been thought to prevent the President from executing
         the laws. Unlike an administrative commission confined to the enforcement of the statute
         under which it was created, or the head to a department when administering a particular
         statute, the President is a constitutional officer charged with taking care that a 'mass of
         legislation' be executed. Flexibility as to mode of execution to meet critical situations
         is a matter of practical necessity. This practical construction of the 'Take Care' clause,
         adocated by John Marshall, was adopted by this Court in In re Neagle, In re Debs and other
         cases cited supra. See also Ex parte Quirin, 1942, <span class="citation">

         power, advocated in dissenting opinions of Justices Holmes, McReynolds and Brandeis, were
         emphatically rejected by this Court in Myers v. United States, supra, members of today's
         majority treat these dissenting views as authoritative.</p>


      <span class="num">502</span>
      <p>There is no statute prohibiting seizure as a method of enforcing legislative programs.
         Congress has in no wise indicated that its legislation is not to be executed by the taking
         of private property (subject of course to the payment of just compensation) if its
         legislation cannot otherwise be executed. Indeed, the Universal Military Training and
         Service Act authorizes the seizure of any plant that fails to fill a Government contract<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn84" id="fn84_ref">84</a> or the properties of any steel
         producer that fails to allocate steel as directed for defense production.<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn85" id="fn85_ref">85</a> And the Defense Production Act
         authorizes the President to requisition equipment and condemn real property needed without
         delay in the defense effort.<a class="footnote" href="#fn86" id="fn86_ref">86</a> Where
         Congress authorizes seizure in instances not necessarily crucial to the defense program, it
         can hardly be said to have disclosed an intention to prohibit seizures where essential to
         the execution of that legislative program.</p>


      <span class="num">503</span>
      <p>Whatever the extent of Presidential power on more tranquil occasions, and whatever the
         right of the President to execute legislative programs as he sees fit without reporting the
         mode of execution to Congress, the single Presidential purpose disclosed on this record is
         to faithfully execute the laws by acting in an emergency to maintain the status quo,
         thereby preventing collapse of the legislative programs until Congress could act. The
         President's action served the same purposes as a judicial stay entered to maintain the
         status quo in order to preserve the jurisdiction of a court. In his Message to Congress
         immediately following the seizure, the President explained the necessity of his action in
         executing the military procurement and anti-inflation legislative programs and expressed
         his desire to cooperate with any legislative proposals approving, regulating or rejecting
         the seizure of the steel mills. Consequently, there is no evidence whatever of any
         Presidential purpose to defy Congress or act in any way inconsistent with the legislative
         will.</p>


      <span class="num">504</span>
      <p>In United States v. Midwest Oil Co., supra, this Court approved executive action where, as
         here, the President acted to preserve an important matter until Congress could
         act&amp;#8212;even though his action in that case was contrary to an express statute. In
         this case, there is no statute prohibiting the action taken by the President in a matter
         not merely important but threatening the very safety of the Nation. Executive inaction in
         such a situation, courting national disaster, is foreign to the concept of energy and
         initiative in the Executive as created by the Founding Fathers. The Constitution was itself
         'adopted in a period of grave emergency. * * * While emergency does not create power,
         emergency may furnish the occasion for the exercise of power.'<a class="footnote"
            href="#fn87" id="fn87_ref">87</a> The Framers knew, as we should know in these times of
         peril, that there is real danger in Executive weakness. There is no cause to fear Executive
         tyranny so long as the laws of Congress are being faithfully executed. Certainly there is
         no basis for fear of dictatorship when the Executive acts, as he did in this case, only to
         save the situation until Congress could act.</p>


      <span class="num">505</span>
      <p>Plaintiffs place their primary emphasis on the Labor M anagement Relations Act of 1947,
         hereinafter referred to as the Taft-Hartley Act, but do not contend that that Act contains
         any provision prohibiting seizure.</p>


      <span class="num">506</span>
      <p>Under the Taft-Hartley Act, as under the Wagner Act, collective bargaining and the right to
         strike are at the heart of our national labor policy. Taft-Hartley preserves the right to
         strike in any emergency, however serious, subject only to an 80-day delay in cases of
         strikes imperiling the national health and safety.<a class="footnote" href="#fn88"
            id="fn88_ref">88</a> In such a case, the President may appoint a board of inquiry to
         report the facts of the labor dispute. Upon receiving that report, the President may direct
         the Attorney General to petition a District Court to enjoin the strike. If the injunction
         is granted, it may continue in effect for no more than 80 days, during which time the board
         of inquiry makes further report and efforts are made to settle the dispute. When the
         injunction is dissolved, the President is directed to submit a report to Congress together
         with his recommendations.<a class="footnote" href="#fn89" id="fn89_ref">89</a>

      <span class="num">507</span>
      <p>Enacted after World War II, Taft-Hartley restricts the right to strike against private
         employers only to a limited extent and for the sole purpose of affording an additional
         period of time within which to settle the dispute. Taft-Hartley in no way curbs strikes
         before an injunction can be obtained and after an 80-day injunction is dissolved.</p>


      <span class="num">508</span>
      <p>Plaintiffs admit that the emergency procedures of Taft-Hartley are not mandatory.
         Nevertheless, plaintiffs apparently argue that, since Congress did provide the 80-day
         injunction method for dealing with emergency strikes, the President cannot claim that an
         emergency exists until the procedures of Taft-Hartley have been exhausted. This argument
         was not the basis of the District Court's opinion and, whatever merit the argument might
         have had following the enactment of Taft-Hartley, it loses all force when viewed in light
         of the statutory pattern confronting the President in this case.</p>


      <span class="num">509</span>
      <p>In Title V of the Defense Production Act of 1950,<a class="footnote" href="#fn90"
            id="fn90_ref">90</a> Congress stated:</p>


      <span class="num">510</span>
      <p>'It is the intent of Congress, in order to provide for effective price and wage
         stabilization pursuant to title IV of this Act and to maintain uninterrupted production,
         that there be effective procedures for the settlement of labor disputes affecting national
         defense.' &amp;#167; 501.</p>


      <span class="num">511</span>
      <p>Title V authorized the President to initiate labor-management conferences and to take
         action appropriate to carrying out the recommendations of such conferences and the
         provisions of Title V. &amp;#167; 502. Due regard is to be given to collective bargaining
         practice and stabilization policies and no action taken is to be inconsistent with
         Taft-Hartley and other laws. &amp;#167; 503. The purpose of these provisions was to
         authorize the President 'to establish a board, commission or other agency, similar to the
         War Labor Board of World War II, to carry out the title.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn91"

      </p>


      <span class="num">512</span>
      <p>The President authorized the Wage Stabilization Board (WSB), which administers the wage
         stabilization functions of Title IV of the Defense Production Act, also to deal with labor
         disputes affecting the defense program.<a class="footnote" href="#fn92" id="fn92_ref"
            >92</a> When extension of the Defense Production Act was before Congress in 1951, the
         Chairman of the Wage Stabilization Board described in detail the relationship between the
         Taft-Hartley procedures applicable to labor disputes imperiling the national health and
         safety and the new WSB dispute procedures especially devised for settlement of labor
         disputes growing out of the needs of the defense prgram.<a class="footnote" href="#fn93"
            id="fn93_ref">93</a> Aware that a technique separate from Taft-Hartley had been devised,
         members of Congress attempted to divest the WSB of its disputes powers. These attempts were
         defeated in the House, were not brought to a vote in the Senate and the Defense Production
         Act was extended through June 30, 1952, without change in the disputes powers of the WSB.<a
            class="footnote" href="#fn94" id="fn94_ref">94</a> Certainly this legislative creation
         of a new procedure for dealing with defense disputes negatives any notion that Congress
         intended the earlier and discretionary Taft-Hartley procedure to be an exclusive
         procedure.</p>


      <span class="num">513</span>
      <p>Accordingly, as of December 22, 1951, the President had a choice between alternate
         procedures for settling the threatened strike in the steel mills: one route created to deal
         with peacetime disputes; the other route specially created to deal with disputes growing
         out of the defense and stabilization program. There is no question of by-passing a
         statutory procedure because both of the routes available to the President in December were
         based upon statutory authorization. Both routes were available in the steel dispute. The
         Union, by refusing to abide by the defense and stabilization program, could have forced the
         President to invoke Taft-Hartley at that time to delay the strike a maximum of 80 days.
         Instead, the Union agreed to cooperate with the defense program and submit the dispute to
         the Wage Stabilization Board.</p>


      <span class="num">514</span>
      <p>Plaintiffs had no objection whatever at that time to the President's choice of the WSB
         route. As a result, the strike was postponed, a WSB panel held hearings and reported the
         position of the parties and the WSB recommended the terms of a settlement which it found
         were fair and equitable. Moreover, the WSB performed a function which the board of inquiry
         contemplated by Taft-Hartley could not have accomplished when it checked the recommended
         wage settlement against its own wage stabilization regulations issued pursuant to its
         stabilization functions under Title IV of the Defense Production Act. Thereafter, the
         parties bargained on the basis of the WSB recommendation.</p>


      <span class="num">515</span>
      <p>When the President acted on April 8, he had exhausted the procedures for settlement
         available to him. Taft-Hartley was a route parallel to, not connected with, the WSB
         procedure. The strike had been delayed 99 days as contrasted with the maximum delay of 80
         days under Taft-Hartley. There had been a hearing on the issues in dispute and bargaining
         which promised settlement up to the very hour before seizure had broken down. Faced with
         immediate national peril through stoppage in steel production on the one hand and faced
         with destruction of the wage and price legislative programs on the other, the President
         took temporary possession of the steel mills as the only course open to him consistent with
         his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.</p>


      <span class="num">516</span>
      <p>Plaintiffs' property was taken and placed in the possession of the Secretary of Commerce to
         prevent any interruption in steel production. It made no difference whether the stoppage
         was caused by a union-management dispute over terms and conditions of employmnt, a
         union-Government dispute over wage stabilization or a management-Government dispute over
         price stabilization. The President's action has thus far been effective, not in settling
         the dispute, but in saving the various legislative programs at stake from destruction until
         Congress could act in the matter.</p>

      <p>VI.</p>

      <span class="num">517</span>
      <p>The diversity of views expressed in the six opinions of the majority, the lack of reference
         to authoritative precedent, the repeated reliance upon prior dissenting opinions, the
         complete disregard of the uncontroverted facts showing the gravity of the emergency and the
         temporary nature of the taking all serve to demonstrate how far afield one must go to
         affirm the order of the District Court.</p>


      <span class="num">518</span>
      <p>The broad executive power granted by Article II to an officer on duty 365 days a year
         cannot, it is said, be invoked to avert disaster. Instead, the President must confine
         himself to sending a message to Congress recommending action. Under this messenger-boy
         concept of the Office, the President cannot even act to preserve legislative programs from
         destruction so that Congress will have something left to act upon. There is no judicial
         finding that the executive action was unwarranted because there was in fact no basis for
         the President's finding of the existence of an emergency<a class="footnote" href="#fn95"
            id="fn95_ref">95</a> for, under this view, the gravity of the emergency and the
         immediacy of the threatened disaster are considered irrelevant as a matter of law.</p>


      <span class="num">519</span>
      <p>Seizure of plaintiffs' property is not a pleasant undertaking. Similarly unpleasant to a
         free country are the draft which disrupts the home and military procurement which causes
         economic dislocation and compels adoption of price controls, wage stabilization and
         allocation of materials. The President informed Congress that even a temporary Government
         operation of plaintiffs' properties was 'thoroughly distasteful' to him, but was necessary
         to prevent immediate paralysis of the mobilization program. Presidents have been in the
         past, and any man worthy of the Office should be in the future, free to take at least
         interim action necessary to execute legislative programs essential to survival of the
         Nation. A sturdy judiciary should not be swayed by the unpleasantness or unpopularity of
         necessary executive action, but must independently determine for itself whether the
         President was acting, as required by the Constitution, to 'take Care that the Laws be
         faithfully executed.'</p>


      <span class="num">520</span>
      <p>As the District Judge stated, this is no time for 'timorous' judicial action. But neither
         is this a time for timorous executive action. Faced with the duty of executing the defense
         programs which Congress had enacted and the disastrous effects that any stoppage in steel
         production would have on those programs, the President acted to preserve those programs by
         seizing the steel mills. There is no question that the possession was other than temporary
         in character and subject to congressional direction&amp;#8212;either approving,
         disapproving or regulating the manner in which the mills were to be administered and
         returned to the owners. The President immediately informed Congress of his action and
         clearly stated his intention to abide by the legislative will. No basis for claims of
         arbitrary action, unlimited powers or dictatorial usurpation of congressional power appears
         from the facts of this case. On the contrary, judicial, legislative and executive
         precedents throughout our history demonstrate that in this case the President acted in full
         conformity with his duties under the Constitution. Accordingly, we would reverse the order
         of the District Court.</p>

         about a peaceful termination of the controversy. Should this expectation fail, the bill
         provides for the President laying the matter before Congress for whatever legislation seems

         17.</p>
      <p>In the debates Senator H. Alexander Smith, a member of the Senate Committee on Labor and

         referred to the President, who can use his discretion as to whether he will present the

      <p>'Nothing has been done with respect to the Smith-Connally Act. There is no provision for

         is hardly necessary to note that Congressional authorization of an agency similar to the
         War Labor Board does not imply a Congressional grant of seizure power similar to that given
         the President specifically by &amp;#167; 3 of the War Labor Disputes Act of 1943. The War
         Labor Board, created by &amp;#167; 7 of the 1943 Act, had only administrative sanctions.
         See 57 Stat. 163, 166&amp;#8212;167; see Report of Senate Committee on Labor and Public
         Welfare, The Disputes Functions of the Wage Stabilization Board, 1951, S.Rep. No. 1037, 82d

         given to the President, not to the War Labor Board, and was needed only when the War Labor
         Board reported it had failed; the seizure power was separate and apart from the War Labor
         Board machinery for settling disputes. At most the Defense Production Act does what
         &amp;#167; 7 of the War Labor Disputes Act did; the omission of any grant of seizure power
         similar to &amp;#167; 3 is too obvious not to have been conscious. At any rate, the Wage
         Stabilization Board differs substantially from the earlier War Labor Board. In 1951 the
         Senate Committee studying the disputes functions of the Wage Stabilization Board pointed
         out the substantial differences between that Board and its predecessor and concluded that

         Functions of Wage Stabilization Board, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. (May 28&amp;#8212;June 15,
         1951); Hearings before the Subcommittee on Labor and Labor-Management Relations of Senate
         Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, Wage Stabilization and Disputes Program, 82d Cong.,
         1st Sess. (May 17&amp;#8212;June 7, 1951). The resulting Report of the Senate Committee,
         S.Rep. No. 1037, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. 9, recommended that 'Title V of the Defense
         Production Act be retained' and that 'No statutory limitations be imposed on the
         President's authority to deal with disputes through voluntary machinery; such limitations,
         we believe, would infringe on the President's constitutional power.' (Emphasis added.) The
         Committee found, id., at 10, that the 'Wage Stabilization Board relies completely on
         voluntary means for settling disputes and is, therefore, an extension of free collective
         bargaining. The Board has no powers of legal compulsion.' 'Executive Order No. 10233,' the
         Committee found further, 'does not in any way run counter to the * * * Taft-Hartley Act. It
         is simply an additional tool, not a substitute for these laws.' Of particular relevance to
         the present case, the Committee declared:</p>
      <p>'The recommendations of the Wage Stabilization Board in disputes certified by the President
         have no compulsive force. The parties are free to disregard recommendations of the Wage
         Stabilization Board * * *.</p>
      <p>'There is, of course, the President's authority to seize plants under the Selective Service
         Act (a power not here used), but this is an authority which exists independently of the
         Wage Stabilization Board and its disputes-handling functions. In any case, seizure is an
         extraordinary remedy, and the authority to seize, operates whether or not there is a
         disputes-handling machinery.' Id., at 5.</p>

      <p> One of President Wilson's seizures has given rise to controversy. In his testimony in
         justification of the Montgomery Ward seizure during World War II, Attorney General Biddle
         argued that the World War I seizure of Smith &amp;amp; Wesson could not be supported under
         any of the World War I statutes authorizing seizure. He thus adduced it in support of the
         claim of so-called inherent presidential power of seizure. See Hearings before House Select
         Committee to Investigate the Seizure of Montgomery Ward, 78th Cong., 2d Sess.
         167&amp;#8212;168. In so doing, he followed the ardor of advocates in claiming everything.
         In his own opinion to the President, he rested the power to seize Montgomery Ward on the
         statutory authority of the War Labor Disputes Act, see 40 Ops. Att'y Gen. 312 (1944), and
         the Court of Appeals decision upholding the Montgomery Ward seizure confined itself to that
         ground. United States v. Montgomery Ward &amp;amp; Co., 7 Cir., <span class="citation">

            </a>
         </span>. What Attorney General Biddle said about Smith &amp;amp; Wesson was, of course,
         post litem motam. Whether or not the World War I statutes were broad enough to justify that
         seizure, it is clear that the taking officers conceived themselves as moving within the
         scope of statute law. See n. 3, Appendix II, infra. Thus, whether or not that seizure was
         within the statute, it cannot properly be cited as a precedent for the one before us. On
         this general subject, compare Attorney General Knox's opinion advising President Theodore
         Roosevelt against the so-called 'stewardship' theory of the Presidency. National Archives,

         </span>, 57 S.Ct. 216, 221, 81 L.Ed. 255, involved, not the question of the President's
         power to act without congressional au-</p>
      <p>thority, but the question of his right to act under and in accord with an Act of Congress.
         The constitutionality of the Act under which the President had proceeded was assailed on
         the ground that it delegated legislative powers to the President. Much of the Court's
         opinion is dictum, but the ratio decidendi is contained in the following language:</p>
      <p>'When the President is to be authorized by legislation to act in respect of a matter
         intended to affect a situation in foreign territory, the legislator properly bears in mind
         the important consideration that the form of the President's action&amp;#8212;or, indeed,
         whether he shall act at all&amp;#8212;may well depend, among other things, upon the nature
         of the confidential information which he has or may thereafter receive, or upon the effect
         which his action may have upon our foreign relations. This consideration, in connection
         with what we have already said on the subject, discloses the unwisdom of requiring Congress
         in this field of governmental power to lay down narrowly definite standards by which the
         President is to be governed. As this court said in Mackenzie v. Hare, <span
            class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/viD/mackenzie-v-hare/">
               <span class="volume">239</span>

            </a>
         </span>, 311, 36 S.Ct. 106, 108, 60 L.Ed. 297, 'As a government, the United States is
         invested with all the attributes of sovereignty. As it has the character of nationality it
         has the powers of nationality, especially those which concern its relations and intercourse
         with other countries. We should hesitate long before limiting or embarrasing such powers.'
         (Italics supplied.)'</p>
      <p>That case does not solve the present controversy. It recognized internal and external
         affairs as being in separate categories, and held that the strict limitation upon
         congressional delegations of power to the President over internal affairs does not apply
         with respect to delegations of power in external affairs. It was intimated that the
         President might act in external affairs without congressional authority, but not that he
         might act contrary to an Act of Congress.</p>

      <p> The oft-cited Louisiana Purchase had nothing to do with the separation of powers as
         between the President and Congress, but only with state and federal power. The Louisiana
         Purchase was subject to rather academic criticism, not upon the ground that Mr. Jefferson
         acted without authority from Congress, but that neither had express authority to expand the
         boundaries of the United States by purchase or annexation. Mr. Jefferson himself had
         strongly opposed the doctrine that the State's delegation of powers to the Federal
         Government could be enlarged by resort to implied powers. Afterwards in a letter to John
         Breckenridge, dated August 12, 1803, he declared:</p>
      <p>'The Constitution has made no provision for our holding foreign territory, still less for
         incorporating foreign nations into our Union. The executive in seizing the fugitive
         occurrence which so much advances the good of their country, have done an act beyond the
         Constitution. The Legislature is casting behind them metaphysical subtleties, and risking
         themselves like faithful servants, must ratify and pay for it, and throw themselves on
         their country for doing for them unauthorized, what we know they would have done for
         themselves had they been in a situation to do it.' 10 The Writings of Thomas Jefferson

      <p> How widely this doctrine espoused by the President's counsel departs from the early view
         of presidential power is shown by a comparison. President Jefferson, without authority from
         Congress, sent the American Fleet into the Mediterranean, where it engaged in a naval
         battle with the Tripolitan fleet. He sent a message to Congress on December 8, 1801, in
         which he said:</p>
      <p>'Tripoli, the least considerable of the Barbary States, had come forward with demands
         unfounded either in right or in compact, and had permitted itself to denounce war on our
         failure to comply before a given day. The style of the demand admitted but one answer. I
         sent a small squadron of frigates into the Mediterranean * * * with orders to protect our
         commerce against the threatened attack. * * * Our commerce in the Mediterranean was
         blockaded, and that of the Atlantic in peril. * * * One of the Tripolitan cruisers having
         fallen in with, and engaged the small schooner Enterprise, * * * was captured, after a
         heavy slaughter of her men * * *. Unauthorized by the constitution, without the sanction of
         Congress, to go beyond the line of defence, the vessel being disabled from committing
         further hostilities, was liberated with its crew. The legislature will doubltless consider
         whether, by authorizing measures of offence, also, they will place our force on an equal
         footing with that of its adversaries. I communicate all material information on this
         subject, that in the exercise of the important function confided by the constitution to the
         legislature exclusively, their judgment may form itself on a knowledge and consideration of
         every circumstance of weight.' I Richardson, Messages and Papers of the Presidents,

      <p> In 1940, President Roosevelt proposed to transfer to Great Britain certain overage
         destroyers and small patrol boats then under construction. He did not presume to rely upon
         any claim of constitutional power as Commander-in-Chief. On the contrary, he was advised
         that such destroyers&amp;#8212;if certified not to be essential to the defense of the
         United States&amp;#8212;could be 'transferred, exchanged, sold, or otherwise disposed of,'
         because Congress had so authorized him. Accordingly, the destroyers were exchanged for air
         bases. In the same opinion, he was advised that Congress had prohibited the release or
         transfer of the so-called 'mosquito boats' then under construction, so those boats were not
         transferred. In the Matter of Acquisition of Naval and Air Bases in Exchange for Overage

      <p> President Wilson, just before our entrance into World War I, went before the Congress and
         asked its approval of his decision to authorize merchant ships to carry defensive weapons.
         He said:</p>
      <p>'No doubt I already possess that authority without special warrant of law, by the plain
         implication of my constitutional duties and powers; but I prefer in the present
         circumstances not to act upon general implication. I wish to feel that the authority and
         the power of the Congress are behind me in whatever it may become necessary for me to do.
         We are jointly the servants of the people and must act together and in their spirit, so far
         as we can divine and interpret it.' XVII Richardson, op.cit., 8211.</p>
      <p>When our Government was itself in need of shipping whilst ships flying the flags of nations
         overrun by Hitler, as well as belligerent merchantmen, were immobilized in American harbors
         where they had taken refuge, President Roosevelt did not assume that it was in his power to
         seize such foreign vessels to make up our own deficit. He informed Congress: 'I am
         satisfied, after consultation with the heads of the interested departments and
         agencies,</p>
      <p>that we should have statutory authority to take over such vessels as our needs require. * *

         D. Roosevelt, 1941 (Rosenman), 94. The necessary statutory authority was shortly
         forthcoming. 55 Stat. 242.</p>
      <p>In his first inaugural address President Roosevelt pointed out two courses to obtain
         legislative remedies, one being to enact measures he was prepared to recommend, the other
         to enact measures 'the Congress may build out of its experience and wisdom.' He continued,
         'But in the event that the Congress shall fail to take and of these two courses, and in the
         event that the national emergency is still critical, I shall not evade the clear course of
         duty that will then confront me. I shall ask the Congress for the one remaining instrument
         to meet the crisis&amp;#8212;broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as
         great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.'

      <p>On March 6, 1933, 48 Stat. 1689, President Roosevelt proclaimed the Bank Holiday. The
         Proclamation did not invoke constitutional powers of the Executive but expressly and solely
         relied upon the Act of Congress of October 6, 1917, 40 Stat. 411, &amp;#167; 5(b), as
         amended, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, &amp;#167; 5(b). He relied steadily on legislation to empower
         him to deal with economic emergency. The Public Papers and Addresses of Franklin D.

      <p>It is interesting to note Holdsworth's comment on the powers of legislation by proclamation
         when in the hands of the Tudors. 'The extent to which they could be legally used was never
         finally settled in this century, because the Tudors made so tactful a use of their powers
         that no demand for the settlement of this question was raised.' 4 Holdsworth, History of

      <p> The North American Aviation Company was under direct and binding contracts to supply
         defense items to the Government. No such contracts are claimed to exist here. Seizure of
         plants which refused to comply with Government orders had been expressly authorized by
         Congress in &amp;#167; 9 of the Selective Service Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 885, 892, so that
         the seizure of the North American plant was entirely consistent with congressional policy.
         The company might have objected on technical grounds to the seizure, but it was taken over
         with acquiescence, amounting to all but consent, of the owners who had admitted that the
         situation was beyond their control. The strike involved in the North American case was in
         violation of the union's collective agreement and the national labor leaders approved the
         seizure to end the strike. It was described as in the nature of an insurrection, a
         Communist-led political strike against the Government's lend-lease policy. Here we have
         only a loyal, lawful, but regrettable economic disagreement between management and labor.
         The North American plant contained government-owned machinery, material and goods in the
         process of production to which workmen were forcibly denied access by picketing strikers.
         Here no Government property is protected by the seizure. See New York Times of June 10,
         1941, pp. 1, 14 and 16, for substantially accurate account of the proceedings and the
         conditions of violence at the North American plant.</p>
      <p>The North American seizure was regarded as an execution of congressional policy. I do not
         regard it as a precedent for this, but, even if I did, I should not bind present judicial
         judgment by earlier partisan advocacy.</p>
      <p>Statements from a letter by the Attorney General to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on
         Labor and Public Welfare, dated February 2, 1949, with reference to pending labor
         legislation, while not cited by any of the parties here are sometimes quoted as being in
         support of the 'inherent' powers of the President. The proposed bill contained a mandatory
         provision that during certain investigations the disputants in a labor dispute should
         continue operations under the terms and conditions of employment existing prior to the
         beginning of the dispute. It made no provision as to how continuance should be enforced and
         specified no penalty for disobedience. The Attorney General advised that in appropriate
         circumstances the United States would have access to the courts to protect the national
         health, safety and welfare. This was the rule laid down by this Court in Texas &amp;amp;

         congressional authorization. I do not suppose it is open to doubt that power to see that

         Attorney General in this letter.</p>

      <p> The Chairman of the Senate Committee sponsoring the bill said in the Senate:</p>
      <p>'We did not feel that we should put into the law, as a part of the collectivebargaining
         machinery, an ultimate resort to compulsory arbitration, or to seizure, or to any other
         action. We feel that it would interfere with the whole process of collective bargaining. If
         such a remedy is available as a routine remedy, there will always be pressure to resort to
         it by whichever party thinks it will receive better treatment through such a process than
         it would receive in collective bargaining, and it will back out of collective bargaining.
         It will not make a bona-fide attempt to settle if it thinks it will receive a better deal
         under the final arbitration which may be provided.</p>
      <p>'We have felt that perhaps in the case of a general strike, or in the case of other serious
         strikes, after the termination of every possible effort to resolve the dispute, the remedy
         might be an emergency act by Congress for that particular purpose.</p>
      <p>'I have had in mind drafting such a bill, giving power to seize the plants, and other
         necessary facilities, to seize the unions, their money, and their treasury, and requisition
         trucks and other equipment; in fact, to do everything that the British did in their general
         strike of 1926. But while such a bill might be prepared, I should be unwilling to place
         such a law on the books until we actually face such an emergency, and Congress applies the
         remedy for the particular emergency only. Eighty days will provide plenty of time within
         which to consider the possibility of what should be done; and we believe very strongly that
         there should not be anything in this law which prohibits finally the right to strike.' 93

      <p> The producer must have been notified that the order was placed pursuant to the Act. The
         Act provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>
      <p>'(a) Whenever the President after consultation with and receiving advice from the National
         Security Resources Board determines that it is in the interest of the national security for
         the Government to obtain prompt delivery of any articles or materials the procurement of
         which has been authorized by the Congress exclusively for the use of the armed forces of
         the United States, or for the use of the Atomic Energy Commission, he is authorized,
         through the head of any Government agency, to place with any person operating a plant,
         mine, or other facility capable of producing such articles or materials an order for such
         quantity of such articles or materials as the President deems appropriate. Any person with
         whom an order is placed pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be advised that
         such order is placed pursuant to the provisions of this section.</p>
      <p>'(c) In case any person with whom an order is placed pursuant to the provisions of
         subsection (a) refuses or fails&amp;#8212;</p>
      <p>'(2) to fill such order within the period of time prescribed by the President or as soon
         thereafter as possible as determined by the President;</p>
      <p>'(3) to produce the kind or quality of articles or materials ordered; or</p>
      <p>'(4) to furnish the quantity, kind, and quality of articles or materials ordered at such
         price as shall be negotiated between such person and the Government agency concerned; or in
         the event of failure to negotiate a price, to furnish the quantity, kind, and quality of
         articles or materials ordered at such price as he may subsequently be determined to be
         entitled to receive under subsection (d); the President is authorized to take immediate
         possession of any plant, mine, or other facility of such person and to operate it, through
         any Government agency, for the production of such articles or materials as may be required
         by the Government.' 62 Stat. 625, 50 U.S.C.App. (Supp. IV) &amp;#167; 468, 50
         U.S.C.A.Appendix, &amp;#167; 468. The Act was amended in 1951 and redesignated the
         Universal Military Training and Service Act, but no change was made in this section. 65

      <p> The Government has offered no explanation, in the record, the briefs, or the oral
         argument, as to why it could not have made both a literal and timely compliance with the
         provisions of that Act. Apparently the Government could have placed orders with the steel
         companies for the various types of steel needed for defense purposes, and instructed the
         steel companies to ship the mate riel directly to producers of planes, tanks, and
         munitions. The Act does not require that government orders cover the entire capacity of a
         producer's plant before the President has power to seize.</p>
      <p>Our experience during World War I demonstrates the speed with which the Government can
         invoke the remedy of seizing plants which fail to fill compulsory orders. The Federal
         Enameling &amp;amp; Stamping Co., of McKees Rocks, Pa., was served with a compulsory order
         on September 13, 1918, and seized on the same day. The Smith &amp;amp; Wesson plant at
         Springfield, Mass., was seized on September 13, 1918, after the company had failed to make
         deliveries under a compulsory order issued the preceding week. Communication from Ordnance
         Office to War Department Board of Appraisers, entitled 'Report on Plants Commandeered by
         the Ordnance Office,' Dec. 19, 1918, pp. 3, 4, in National Archives, Records of the War
         Department, Office of the Chief of Ordnance, O.O. 004.002/260. Apparently the Mosler Safe
         Co., of Hamilton, Ohio, was seized on the same day on which a compulsory order was issued.
