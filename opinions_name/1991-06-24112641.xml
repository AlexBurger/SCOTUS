      </p>
      <p>JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
      <p>We are asked once again to mark the boundaries of state sovereign immunity from suit in
         federal court. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that immunity did not
         extend to suits by Indian tribes, and Alaska seeks review of that determination.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>I</h2>
      <p>In 1980, Alaska enacted a revenue-sharing statute that provided annual payments of $25,000
         to each "Native village government" located in a community without a state-chartered <span
            class="star-pagination">*778</span> municipal corporation. Alaska Stat. Ann. § 29.89.050
         (1984). The State's attorney general believed the statute to be unconstitutional. In his
         view, Native village governments were "racially exclusive groups" or "racially exclusive
         organizations" whose status turned exclusively on the racial ancestry of their members;
         therefore, the attorney general believed, funding these groups would violate the equal
         protection clause of Alaska's Constitution. Acting on the attorney general's advice, the
         Commissioner of Alaska's Department of Community and Regional Affairs (petitioner here),
         enlarged the program to include all unincorporated communities, whether administered by
         Native governments or not. Shortly thereafter, the legislature increased funding under the
         program to match its increased scope. Funding, however, never reached the full $25,000
         initially allocated to each unincorporated Native community.</p>
      <p>The legislature repealed the revenue-sharing statute in 1985, see 1985 Alaska Sess. Laws,
         ch. 90, and replaced it with one that matched the program as expanded by the commissioner.
         In the same year, respondents filed this suit, challenging the commissioner's action on
         federal equal protection grounds, and seeking an order requiring the commissioner to pay
         them the money that they would have received had the commissioner not enlarged the program.
         The District Court initially granted an injunction to preserve sufficient funds for the
         1986 fiscal year, but then dismissed the suit as violating the Eleventh Amendment. The
         Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, first on the ground that 28 U. S. C. §
         1362 constituted a congressional abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity, Native Village
         of Noatak v. Hoffman, 872 F. 2d 1384 (1989) (later withdrawn), and then, upon
         reconsideration, on the ground that Alaska had no immunity against suits by Indian tribes.
         896 F. 2d 1157 (1989). We granted certiorari sub nom. Hoffman v. Native Village of Noatak,
         498 U. S. 807 (1990).</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>
         <span class="star-pagination">*779</span> II</h2>
      <p>The Eleventh Amendment provides as follows:</p> "The Judicial power of the United States
      shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against
      one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any
      Foreign State." <p>Despite the narrowness of its terms, since Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1
         (1890), we have understood the Eleventh Amendment to stand not so much for what it says,
         but for the presupposition of our constitutional structure which it confirms: that the
         States entered the federal system with their sovereignty intact; that the judicial
         authority in Article III is limited by this sovereignty, Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways
         and Public Transportation, 483 U. S. 468, 472 (1987) (plurality opinion); Employees of
         Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of
         Mo., 411 U. S. 279, 290-294 (1973) (MARSHALL, J., concurring in result); and that a State
         will therefore not be subject to suit in federal court unless it has consented to suit,
         either expressly or in the "plan of the convention." See Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corp.
         v. Feeney, 495 U. S. 299, 304 (1990); Welch, supra, at 474 (plurality opinion); Atascadero
         State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 238 (1985); Pennhurst State School and Hospital
         v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 99 (1984).</p>
      <p>Respondents do not ask us to revisit Hans; instead they argue that the traditional
         principles of immunity presumed by Hans do not apply to suits by sovereigns like Indian
         tribes. And even if they did, respondents contend, the States have consented to suits by
         tribes in the "plan of the convention." We consider these points in turn.</p>
      <p>In arguing that sovereign immunity does not restrict suit by Indian tribes, respondents
         submit, first, that sovereign <span class="star-pagination">*780</span> immunity only
         restricts suits by individuals against sovereigns, not by sovereigns against sovereigns,
         and as we have recognized, Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band of Potawatomi Tribe of
         Okla., 498 U. S. 505, 509 (1991), Indian tribes are sovereigns. Respondents' conception of
         the nature of sovereign immunity finds some support both in the apparent understanding of
         the Founders and in dicta of our own opinions.<span class="sup">[1]</span> But whatever the
         reach or meaning of these early statements, the notion that traditional principles of
         sovereign immunity only restrict suits by individuals was rejected in Principality of
         Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313 (1934). It is with that opinion, and the conception of
         sovereignty that it embraces, that we must begin.</p>
      <p>In Monaco, the Principality had come into possession of Mississippi state bonds, and had
         sued Mississippi in federal court to recover amounts due under those bonds. Mississippi
         defended on grounds of the Eleventh Amendment, among others. Had respondents' understanding
         of sovereign immunity been the Court's, the Eleventh Amendment would not have limited the
         otherwise clear grant of jurisdiction <span class="star-pagination">*781</span> in Article
         III to hear controversies "between a State ... and foreign States." But we held that it
         did.</p> "Manifestly, we cannot rest with a mere literal application of the words of § 2 of
      Article III, or assume that the letter of the Eleventh Amendment exhausts the restrictions
      upon suits against non-consenting States. Behind the words of the constitutional provisions
      are postulates which limit and control. ... There is ... the postulate that States of the
      Union, still possessing attributes of sovereignty, shall be immune from suits, without their
      consent, save where there has been a `surrender of this immunity in the plan of the
      convention.' The Federalist, No. 81." Monaco, supra, at 322-323 (footnote omitted). <p>Our
         clear assumption in Monaco was that sovereign immunity extends against both individuals and
         sovereigns, so that there must be found inherent in the plan of the convention a surrender
         by the States of immunity as to either. Because we perceived in the plan "no ground upon
         which it can be said that any waiver or consent by a State of the Union has run in favor of
         a foreign State," id., at 330, we concluded that foreign states were still subject to the
         immunity of the States.</p>
      <p>We pursue the same inquiry in the present case, and thus confront respondents' second
         contention: that the States waived their immunity against Indian tribes when they adopted
         the Constitution. Just as in Monaco with regard to foreign sovereigns, so also here with
         regard to Indian tribes, there is no compelling evidence that the Founders thought such a
         surrender inherent in the constitutional compact.<span class="sup">[2]</span>
         <span class="star-pagination">*782</span> We have hitherto found a surrender of immunity
         against particular litigants in only two contexts: suits by sister States, South Dakota v.
         North Carolina, 192 U. S. 286, 318 (1904), and suits by the United States, United States v.
         Texas, 143 U. S. 621 (1892). We have not found a surrender by the United States to suit by
         the States, Kansas v. United States, 204 U. S. 331, 342 (1907); see Jackson, The Supreme
         Court, the Eleventh Amendment, and State Sovereign Immunity, 98 Yale L. J. 1, 79-80 (1988),
         nor, again, a surrender by the States to suit by foreign sovereigns, Monaco, supra.</p>
      <p>Respondents argne that Indian tribes are more like States than foreign sovereigns. That is
         true in some respects: They are, for example, domestic. The relevant difference between
         States and foreign sovereigns, however, is not domesticity, but the role of each in the
         convention within which the surrender of immunity was for the former, but not for the
         latter, implicit. What makes the States' surrender of immunity from suit by sister States
         plausible is the mutuality of that concession. There is no such mutuality with either
         foreign sovereigns or Indian tribes. We have repeatedly held that Indian tribes enjoy
         immunity against suits by States, Potawatomi Tribe, supra, at 509, as it would be absurd to
         suggest that the tribes surrendered immunity in a convention to which they were not even
         parties. But if the convention could not surrender the tribes' immunity for the benefit of
         the States, we do not believe that it surrendered the States' immunity for the benefit of
         the tribes.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>III</h2>
      <p>Respondents argue that, if the Eleventh Amendment operates to bar suits by Indian tribes
         against States without their <span class="star-pagination">*783</span> consent, 28 U. S. C.
         § 1362 operates to void that bar. They press two very different arguments, which we
         consider in turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>A</h2>
      <p>In United States v. Minnesota, 270 U. S. 181 (1926), we held that the United States had
         standing to sue on behalf of Indian tribes as guardians of the tribes' rights, and that,
         since "the immunity of the State is subject to the constitutional qualification that she
         may be sued in this Court by the United States," id., at 195, no Eleventh Amendment bar
         would limit the United States' access to federal courts for that purpose. Relying upon our
         decision in Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, 425 U. S. 463 (1976),
         respondents argue that we have read § 1362 to embody a general delegation of the authority
         to sue on the tribes' behalf from the Federal Government back to tribes themselves. Hence,
         respondents suggest, because the United States would face no sovereign immunity limitation,
         in no case brought under § 1362 can sovereign immunity be a bar.</p>
      <p>Section 1362 provides as follows:</p> "The district courts shall have original jurisdiction
      of all civil actions, brought by any Indian tribe or band with a governing body duly
      recoguized by the Secretary of the Interior, wherein the matter in controversy arises under
      the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States." <p>What is striking about this most
         unremarkable statute is its similarity to any number of other grants of jurisdiction to
         district courts to hear federal-question claims. Compare it, for example, with § 1331(a) as
         it existed at the time § 1362 was enacted:</p> "The district courts shall have original
      jurisdiction of all civil actions wherein the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value
      of $10,000 exclusive of interest and costs, and arises under the Constitution, laws, or <span
         class="star-pagination">*784</span> treaties of the United States." 28 U. S. C. § 1331(a)
      (1964 ed.). <p>Considering the text of § 1362 in the context of its enactment, one might well
         conclude that its sole purpose was to eliminate any jurisdictional minimum for "arising
         under" claims brought by Indian tribes. Tribes already had access to federal courts for
         "arising under" claims under § 1331, where the amount in controversy was greater than
         $10,000; for all that appears from its text, § 1362 merely extends that jurisdiction to
         claims below that minimum. Such a reading, moreover, finds support in the very title of the
         Act that adopted § 1362: "To amend the Judicial Code to permit Indian tribes to maintain
         civil actions in Federal district courts without regard to the $10,000 limitation, and for
         other purposes." 80 Stat. 880.</p>
      <p>Moe, however, found something more in the title's "other purposes"&#x97;an implication that
         "a tribe's access to federal court to litigate [federal-question cases] would be at least
         in some respects as broad as that of the United States suing as the tribe's trustee," 425
         U. S., at 473 (emphasis added). The "respect" at issue in Moe was access to federal court
         for the purpose of obtaining injunctive relief from state taxation. The Tax Injunction Act,
         28 U. S. C. § 1341, denied such access to persons other than the United States; we held
         that § 1362 revoked that denial as to Indian tribes. Moe did not purport to be saying that
         § 1362 equated tribal access with the United States' access generally, but only "at least
         in some respects," 425 U. S., at 473, or "in certain respects," id., at 474. Respondents
         now urge us, in effect, to eliminate this limitation utterly&#x97;for it is impossible to
         imagine any more extreme replication of the United States' ability to sue than replication
         even to the point of allowing unconsented suit against state sovereigns. This is a vast
         expansion upon Moe. Section 1341, which Moe held § 1362 to eliminate in its application to
         tribal suits, was merely a limitation that Congress itself had created&#x97;commiting state
         tax-injunction suits <span class="star-pagination">*785</span> to state courts as a matter
         of comity. Absent that statute, state taxes could constitutionally be enjoined. See Will v.
         Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 71, n. 10 (1989).<span class="sup">[3]</span>
         The obstacle to suit in the present case, by contrast, is a creation not of Congress but of
         the Constitution. A willingness to eliminate the former in no way bespeaks a willingness to
         eliminate the latter, especially when limitation to "certain respects" has explicitly been
         announced.</p>
      <p>Moreover, as we shall discuss in Part III-B, our cases require Congress' exercise of the
         power to abrogate state sovereign immunity, where it exists, to be exercised with
         unmistakeable clarity. To avoid that difficulty, respondents assert that § 1362 represents
         not an abrogation of the States' sovereign immunity, but rather a delegation to tribes of
         the Federal Government's exemption from state sovereign immunity. We doubt, to begin with,
         that that sovereign exemption can be delegated&#x97;even if one limits the permissibility
         of delegation (as respondents propose) to persons on whose behalf the United States itself
         might sue. The consent, "inherent in the convention," to suit by the United States&#x97;at
         the instance and under the control of responsible federal officers&#x97; is not consent to
         suit by anyone whom the United States might select; and even consent to suit by the United
         States for a particular person's benefit is not consent to suit by that person himself.</p>
      <p>But in any event, assuming that delegation of exemption from state sovereign immunity is
         theoretically possible, there is no reason to believe that Congress ever contemplated such
            <span class="star-pagination">*786</span> a strange notion. Even if our decision in Moe
         could be regarded as in any way related to sovereign immunity, see n. 3, supra, it could
         nevertheless not be regarded as in any way related to congressional "delegation." The
         opinion does not mention that word, and contains not the slightest suggestion of such an
         analysis. To say that "§ 1362 ... suggests that in certain respects tribes suing under this
         section were to be accorded treatment similar to that of the United States had it sued on
         their behalf," 425 U. S., at 474, does not remotely imply delegation&#x97;only equivalence
         of treatment. The delegation theory is entirely a creature of respondents' own
         invention.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>B</h2>
      <p>Finally, respondents ask us to recognize § 1362 as a congressional abrogation of Eleventh
         Amendment immunity. We have repeatedly said that this power to abrogate can only be
         exercised by a clear legislative statement. As we said in Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S. 223
         (1989):</p> "To temper Congress' acknowledged powers of abrogation with due concern for the
      Eleventh Amendment's role as an essential component of our constitutional structure, we have
      applied a simple but stringent test: `Congress may abrogate the States' constitutionally
      secured immunity from suit in federal court only by making its intention unmistakably clear in
      the language of the statute.'" Id., at 227-228. <p>We agree with petitioner that § 1362 does
         not reflect an "unmistakably clear" intent to abrogate immunity, made plain "in the
         language of the statute." As we have already noted, the text is no more specific than §
         1331, the grant of general federal-question jurisdiction to district courts, and no one
         contends that § 1331 suffices to abrogate immunity for all federal questions.<span
            class="sup">[4]</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*787</span> Respondents' argument, however, is not that §
         1362 is a "clear statement" under the standard of Dellmuth, but rather that it was a
         sufficiently clear statement under the standard of Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama
         Docks Dept., 377 U. S. 184 (1964), the existing authority for "abrogation" at the time of §
         1362's enactment in 1966. In Parden, we found a sufficiently clear intent to avoid state
         immunity in a statute that subjected to liability "every" common carrier in interstate
         commerce, where the State, after the statute's enactment, chose to become a carrier in
         interstate commerce. Id., at 187-188. Similarly, respondents argue, a statute that grants
         jurisdiction to district courts to hear "all civil actions, brought by any Indian tribe"
         should constitute a sufficiently clear expression of intent to abrogate immunity. Dellmuth
         is not to the contrary, respondents maintain, since the statute there was enacted in the
         mid-1970's, long after the rule of Parden had been drawn into question. Dellmuth, supra, at
         231.</p>
      <p>We shall assume for the sake of argument (though we by no means accept) that Congress must
         be presumed to have had as relatively obscure a decision as Parden in mind as a backdrop to
         all its legislation. But even if Congress were aware of Parden's minimal clarity
         requirement, nothing in Parden could lead Congress to presume that that requirement applied
         to the abrogation of state immunity. Parden itself neither mentioned nor was premised upon
         abrogation. Its theory was that, by entering a field of economic activity that is federally
         regulated, the State impliedly "consent[s]" to be <span class="star-pagination">*788</span>
         bound by that regulation and to be subject to suit in federal court on the same terms as
         other regulated parties, thus "waiv[ing]" its Eleventh Amendment immunity. 377 U. S., at
         186. Not until 1976 (10 years after the passage of § 1362) did we first acknowledge a
         congressional power to abrogate state immunity&#x97;under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.
         Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976). Thus, Parden would have given Congress no
         reason to believe it could abrogate state sovereign immunity and gives us no reason to
         believe that Congress intended abrogation by a means so subtle as § 1362. At the time §
         1362 was enacted, abrogation would have been regarded as such a novel (not to say
         questionable) course that a general "arising under" statute like § 1362 would not
         conceivably have been thought to imply it. We conclude that neither under the current
         standard of Dellmuth nor under any standard in effect at the time of Parden was § 1362 an
         abrogation of state sovereign immunity.<span class="sup">[5]</span>
      </p>
      <p/>
      <h2>IV</h2>
      <p>Finally, respondents argue that even if the Eleventh Amendment bars their claims for
         damages, they still seek injunctive relief, which the Eleventh Amendment would not bar. The
         Court of Appeals, of course, did not address this point, and we leave it for that court's
         initial consideration on remand.</p>
      <p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further
         proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
      <p>It is so ordered.</p>
      <p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL and JUSTICE STEVENS join, dissenting.</p>
      <p>The Court today holds that our Eleventh Amendment precludes Native American tribes from
         seeking to vindicate in <span class="star-pagination">*789</span> federal court rights they
         regard as secured to them by the United States Constitution. Because the Court resolves
         this case through reliance on a doctrine I cannot accept, and because I believe its
         construction of the pertinent jurisdictional statute to be otherwise flawed, I dissent.</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>I</h2>
      <p>As some of us previously have stated, see Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S.
         234, 302 (1985) (dissenting opinion), I do not believe the Eleventh Amendment is implicated
         by a suit such as this one, in which litigants seek to vindicate federal rights against a
         State. In my view, the Amendment has no application outside the context of State/citizen
         and State/alien diversity suits.<span class="sup">[*]</span> Put another way, "[t]here
         simply is no constitutional principle of state sovereign immunity, and no constitutionally
         mandated policy of excluding suits against States from federal court." Id., at 259
         (Brennan, J., dissenting).</p>
      <p>The substantial historical analysis that supports this view already has been exhaustively
         detailed, see id., at 258-302 (Brennan, J., joined by MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, and STEVENS, JJ.,
         dissenting); Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transportation, 483 U. S. 468, 497
         (1987) (Brennan, J., joined by MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, and STEVENS, JJ., dissenting);
         Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1, 23 (1989) (STEVENS, J., concurring); Pennhurst
         State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 140-159 (1984) (STEVENS, J., joined
         by Brennan, MARSHALL, and BLACKMUN, JJ., dissenting), and I shall not repeat it here. It
         bears emphasis, however, that the Court need not have compounded the error of Hans v.
         Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 <span class="star-pagination">*790</span> (1890), and its progeny by
         extending the doctrine of state sovereign immunity to bar suits by tribal entities, which
         are neither "Citizens of another State," nor "Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign
         State."</p>
      <p/>
      <h2>II</h2>
      <p>Even assuming that the State at one time may have possessed immunity against tribal suits,
         that immunity was abrogated by Congress when, in 1966, 80 Stat. 880, it enacted 28 U. S. C.
         § 1362. The majority rejects this argument, holding that § 1362 cannot authorize
         respondents' suit because the statute's language does not reflect an "unmistakably clear"
         intent to abrogate the States' sovereign immunity. Ante, at 786. I have never accepted the
         validity of that so-called "clear-statement rule" and I remain of the view, expressed by
         Justice Brennan for four of us in Atascadero, that such "special rules of statutory
         drafting are not justified (nor are they justifiable) as efforts to determine the genuine
         intent of Congress. ... [T]he special rules are designed as hurdles to keep the disfavored
         suits out of the federal courts." 473 U. S., at 254.</p>
      <p>Even if I were to accept the proposition that the clear-statement rule at times might serve
         as a mechanism for discerning congressional intent, I surely would reject its application
         here. Despite the Court's attempt to give it a constitutional cast, the clear-statement
         rule, at bottom, is a tool of statutory construction like any other. So it must be, for the
         Judiciary has no power to redraw legislative enactments; where Congress has the authority
         to regulate a sphere of activity, we simply must do our best to determine whether it has
         done so in any particular instance. The majority's rule is one method for accomplishing
         that task. It is premised on the perception that Congress does not casually alter the
         "balance of power" between the Federal Government and the States. Id., at 242. Because
         federal intrusion into state authority is the unusual case, and because courts are to use
         caution in determining when their own jurisdiction <span class="star-pagination"
            >*791</span> has been expanded, id., at 243, this Court has erected the clear-statement
         rule in order to be certain that abrogation is Congress' plan.</p>
      <p>Whatever the validity of that determination may be generally, it cannot extend to matters
         concerning federal regulation of Native American affairs; in that sphere of governmental
         operations, the "balance of power" always has weighed heavily against the States and in
         favor of the Federal Government. Indeed, "[t]he plenary power of Congress to deal with the
         special problems of Indians is drawn both explicitly and implicitly from the Constitution
         itself." Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 551-552 (1974).</p>
      <p>Illustrative of this principle are our cases holding that the law of the State is generally
         inapplicable to Native American affairs, absent the consent of Congress. See, e. g.,
         Worcester v. Georgia, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/rvg/worcester-v-georgia/">
               <span class="volume">6</span>
               <span class="reporter">Pet.</span>
               <span class="page">515</span>
            </a>
         </span> (1832). Chief Justice Marshall explained for the Court in Worcester that a
         federally recognized tribe</p> "is a distinct community, occupying its own territory, with
      boundaries accurately described, in which the laws of [the State] can have no force, and which
      the citizens of [the State] have no right to enter, but with the assent of the [tribes]
      themselves, or in conformity with treaties, and with the acts of Congress. The whole
      intercourse between the United States and this nation, is, by our Constitution and laws,
      vested in the government of the United States." Id., at 561. <p>Despite the States' undeniable
         interest in regulating activities within its borders, and despite traditional principles of
         federalism, the States' authority has been largely displaced in matters pertaining to
         Native Americans. See The Kansas Indians, <span class="citation">
            <a href="/scotus/s7Z/the-kansas-indians/">
               <span class="volume">5</span>
               <span class="reporter">Wall.</span>
               <span class="page">737</span>
            </a>
         </span> (1867) (finding state taxes inapplicable to tribal lands despite partial
         assimilation of tribe into white society); United States v. Kagama, 118 U. S. 375 (1886)
         (sustaining validity of a prosecution of Native Americans in federal court under the Indian
         Major Crimes Act). Moreover, <span class="star-pagination">*792</span> federal displacement
         of state authority regarding Native American affairs has not been limited to the geographic
         boundaries of "Indian country," see Antoine v. Washington, 420 U. S. 194 (1975) (holding
         that Congress may constitutionally inhibit a State's exercise of its police power over
         non-Indian land through federal legislation ratifying an agreement with a tribe), nor to
         state regulations that directly infringe upon tribal self-government. See McClanahan v.
         Arizona State Tax Comm'n, 411 U. S. 164, 179-180 (1973).</p>
      <p>Thus, in this area, the pertinent "balance of power" is between the Federal Government and
         the tribes, with the States playing only a subsidiary role. Because spheres of activity
         otherwise susceptible to state regulation are, "according to the settled principles of our
         Constitution, ... committed exclusively to the government of the Union," Worcester v.
         Georgia, 6 Pet., at 561, where Native American affairs are concerned, the presumptions
         underlying the clear-statement rule, and thus the rule itself, have no place in
         interpreting statutes pertaining to the tribes.</p>
      <p>Employing the traditional tools of statutory interpretation, I conclude that Congress
         intended, through § 1362, to authorize constitutional claims for damages by tribes against
         the States. Section 1362 provides:</p> "The district courts shall have original
      jurisdiction of all civil actions, brought by any Indian tribe or band with a governing body
      duly recognized by the Secretary of the Interior, wherein the matter in controversy arises
      under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States." (Emphasis added.) <p>The
         majority notes, correctly, that this language is no broader than that of 28 U. S. C. §
         1331(a), as it existed at the time § 1362 was enacted. Ante, at 784. As the preceding
         discussion makes clear, however, this is an area in which "a page of history is worth a
         volume of logic." New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, 256 U. S. 345, 349 (1921). A review of the
            <span class="star-pagination">*793</span> history of the latter statute reveals that
         Congress intended § 1362 to have a broader reach.</p>
      <p>Prior to 1966, the Indian tribes were largely dependent upon the United States Government
         to enforce their rights against state encroachment. See, e. g., United States v. Minnesota,
         270 U. S. 181 (1926). This arrangement derived from the historic trust relationship between
         the tribes and the United States. See F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 308 (1982
         ed.). In seeking judicial protection of tribal interests, the Federal Government, of
         course, was unrestrained by the doctrine of state sovereign immunity. United States v.
         Minnesota, 270 U. S., at 195, citing United States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621 (1892).</p>
      <p>In 1966, Congress enacted 28 U. S. C. § 1362 as part of a larger national policy of
         "self-determination" for the Native American peoples. See M. Price &amp;amp; R. Clinton,
         Law and the American Indian 86-91 (2d ed. 1983). Consistent with that policy, "Congress
         contemplated that § 1362 would be used particularly in situations in which the United
         States suffered from a conflict of interest or was otherwise unable or unwilling to bring
         suit as trustee for the Indians." Arizona v. San Carlos Apache Tribe, 463 U. S. 545, 560,
         n. 10 (1983). In other words, Congress sought to eliminate the tribes' dependence upon the
         United States for the vindication of federal rights in the federal courts.</p>
      <p>In light of that legislative purpose, we held in Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai
         Tribes, 425 U. S. 463 (1976), that the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U. S. C. § 1341, does not bar
         an action to enjoin the collection of state taxes brought by a tribe pursuant to § 1362,
         although it precludes such a suit by a private litigant. Construing § 1362, we identified a
         congressional intent that "a tribe's access to federal court to litigate a matter arising
         `under the Constitution, laws, or treaties' would be at least in some respects as broad as
         that of the United States suing as the tribe's trustee." 425 U. S., at 473. Because the
         Federal Government could have brought <span class="star-pagination">*794</span> such a suit
         on the tribes' behalf, see Heckman v. United States, 224 U. S. 413 (1912), we held that the
         tribes were similarly empowered by § 1362.</p>
      <p>I agree with respondents that the litigation authority bestowed on the tribes through §
         1362 also includes the right to bring federal claims against the States for damages. The
         legislative history of the statute reveals Congress' intention that the tribes bring
         litigation "involving issues identical to those" that would have been raised by the United
         States acting as trustee for the tribes. H. R. Rep. No. 2040, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 2
         (1966) (House Report). There is no reason to believe that this authority would be limited
         to prospective relief in the broad range of suits brought against the States.</p>
      <p>Fundamentally, the vindication of Native American rights has been the institutional
         responsibility of the Federal Government since the Republic's founding. See, e. g.,
         Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, <span class="citation no-link">
            <span class="volume">5</span>
            <span class="reporter">Pet.</span>
            <span class="page">1</span>
         </span>, 17 (1831). Section 1362 represents a frank acknowledgment by the Government that
         it often lacks the resources or the political will adequately to fulfill this
         responsibility. Given this admission, we should not lightly restrict the authority granted
         the tribes to defend their own interests. Rather, the most reasoned interpretation of §
         1362 is as a congressional authorization to bring those suits that are necessary to
         vindicate fully the federal rights of the tribes. It hardly requires explication that
         monetary remedies are often necessary to afford such relief. Providing "the means whereby
         the tribes are assured of the same judicial determination whether the action is brought in
         their behalf by the Government or by their own attorneys," House Report, at 2-3,
         necessarily entails access to monetary redress from the States where federal rights have
         been violated.</p>
      <p>In resisting this conclusion, the majority asserts that, because the Tax Injunction Act is
         merely a congressional enactment while the doctrine of sovereign immunity is a
         constitutional <span class="star-pagination">*795</span> one, a "willingness to eliminate
         the former in no way bespeaks a willingness to eliminate the latter." Ante, at 785. But the
         premise does not lead to the conclusion. Congress, through appropriate legislation, may
         abrogate state sovereign immunity, just as it may repeal or amend its own prior enactments.
         Moreover, the Tax Injunction Act, like the sovereign immunity doctrine, is rooted in
         historical notions of federalism and comity. See Fair Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc.
         v. McNary, 454 U. S. 100, 103 (1981), and cases cited therein. In light of these parallels,
         I find the expansive congressional purpose the Court identified in Moe to provide
         substantial support for the proposition that § 1362 was intended to convey federal
         jurisdiction over "all civil actions," § 1362 (emphasis added), brought by recognized
         tribes that the Government could have brought on their behalf.</p>
      <p>"Finally, in construing this `admittedly ambiguous' statute, Board of Comm'rs v. Seber,
         [318 U. S. 705, 713 (1943)], we must be guided by that `eminently sound and vital canon,'
         Northern Cheyenne Tribe v. Hollowbreast, 425 U. S. 649, 655 n. 7 (1976), that `statutes
         passed for the benefit of dependent Indian tribes . . . are to be liberally construed,
         doubtful expressions being resolved in favor of the Indians.' Alaska Pacific Fisheries v.
         United States, 248 U. S. 78, 89 (1918)." Bryan v. Itasca County, 426 U. S. 373, 392 (1976).
         Unlike the ill-conceived interpretive rule adopted so recently in Atascadero, this canon of
         construction dates back to the earliest years of our Nation's history. See, e. g.,
         Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet., at 582; The Kansas Indians, <span class="citation">

         unique trust relationship between the tribes and the Federal Government that is inherent in
         the constitutional plan. See U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 3; Art. I, § 2, cl. 3. In light
         of this time-honored principle of construction, it requires no linguistic contortion to
         read § 1362's grant of federal jurisdiction over "all civil actions" to encompass <span

         have brought as the tribes' guardian.</p>

      <h2>III</h2>
      <p>Having concluded that respondents' suit may be brought in federal court, I agree with the
         Court of Appeals that respondents are recognized "tribe[s] or band[s]" for purposes of §
         1362, and that they have alleged a federal cause of action. Accordingly, I would affirm the
         judgment of the Court of Appeals. I respectfully dissent from this Court's reversal of that
         judgment.</p>

      <p>[*] Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the State of Alabama et al. by
         Donald J. Hanaway, Attorney General of Wisconsin, and Charles D. Hoornstra, Assistant
         Attorney General, and by the Attorneys General for their respective States as follows: Don
         Siegelman of Alabama, Robert K. Corbin of Arizona, John Steven Clark of Arkansas, Duane

      <p>Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the Native Village of Tanana et al.
         by Lloyd Benton Miller, Eric Smith, and David S. Case; and for the Metlakatla Indian
         Community by Charles A. Hobbs and Christopher T. Stearns.</p>
      <p>Arlinda F. Locklear, Howard Bichler, Bertram Hirsch, and Milton Rosenberg filed a brief for
         the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida et al. as amici curiae.</p>
      <p>[1] As Alexander Hamilton said: "It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty, not to be
         amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent." The Federalist No. 81, pp.
         548-549 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (emphasis added and deleted). James Madison expressed a similar
         understanding at the Virginia Convention ("It is not in the power of individuals to call
         any state into court"), 3 J. Elliot, The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the
         Adoption of the Federal Constitution 533 (2d ed. 1863) (emphasis added), as did Chief
         Justice Marshall ("[A]n individual cannot proceed to obtain judgment against a state,
         though he may be sued by a state"), id., at 555-556 (emphasis added). In United States v.
         Texas, 143 U. S. 621, 645 (1892), we adverted to respondents' distinction explicitly,
         describing Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), as having "proceeded upon the broad
         ground that `it is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of
         an individual without its consent,'" 143 U. S., at 645-646, and concluding that "the
         suability of one government by another government ... does no violence to the inherent
         nature of sovereignty." Id., at 646.</p>
      <p>[2] The only evidence alluded to by respondents is a statement by President Washington to
         Chief Cornplanter of the Seneca Nation: </p>
      <p>"Here, then, is the security for the remainder of your lands. No State, nor person, can
         purchase your lands, unless at some public treaty, held under the authority of the United
         States.</p>
      <p>. . . . .</p>
      <p>"If ... you have any just cause of complaint against [a purchaser], and can make
         satisfactory proof thereof, the federal courts will be open to you for redress, as to all
         other persons." 4 American State Papers, Indian Affairs, Vol. 1, p. 142 (1832). But of
         course, denying Indian tribes the right to sue States in federal court does not
         disadvantage them in relation to "all other persons." Respondents are asking for access
         more favorable than that which others enjoy.</p>
      <p>[3] Such injunction suits can only be brought against state officers in their official
         capacity and not against the State in its own name. Missouri v. Fiske, 290 U. S. 18, 27
         (1933). Respondents argue that since the plaintiffs in Moe v. Confederated Salish and
         Kootenai Tribes, 425 U. S. 463 (1976), named the State of Montana as a defendant, as well
         as individual officers, the decision in that case held that § 1362 eliminated not only the
         statutory bar of § 1341 but sovereign immunity as well. We think not. Since Montana had not
         objected in this Court on sovereign immunity grounds, its immunity had been waived and was
         not at issue.</p>
      <p>[4] In asserting that § 1362's grant of jurisdiction to "all civil actions" suffices to
         abrogate a State's defense of immunity, post, at 795-796, the dissent has just repeated the
         mistake of the Court in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), see id., at 434-450
         (Iredell, J., dissenting), the case that occasioned the Eleventh Amendment itself. The fact
         that Congress grants jurisdiction to hear a claim does not suffice to show Congress has
         abrogated all defenses to that claim. The issues are wholly distinct. A State may waive its
         Eleventh Amendment immunity, and if it does, § 1362 certainly would grant a district court
         jurisdiction to hear the claim. The dissent's view returns us, like Sisyphus, to the
         beginning of this 200-year struggle.</p>
      <p>[5] Because we find that § 1362 does not enable tribes to overcome Alaska's sovereign
         immunity, we express no view on whether these respondents qualify as "tribes" within the
         meaning of that statute.</p>
      <p>[*] The Eleventh Amendment reads: "The Judicial power of the United States shall not be
         construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of
         the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign
         State."</p>
