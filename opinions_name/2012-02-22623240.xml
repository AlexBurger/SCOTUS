    3, 2011—Decided February 22, 2012*&#xD; Medicaid is a cooperative federal-state program that
    provides medical&#xD; care to needy individuals. To qualify for federal funds, a State must&#xD;
    submit its Medicaid plan and any amendments to the federal agency&#xD; that administers the
    program, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid&#xD; Services (CMS). Before approving a plan or
    amendments, CMS con-&#xD; ducts a review to determine whether they comply with federal re-&#xD;
    quirements. Federal law requires state plans or amendments to “as-&#xD; sure that payments are
    consistent with efficiency, economy, and&#xD; quality of care and are sufficient to enlist
    enough providers” to make&#xD; Medicaid “care and services” available. 42 U. S. C.

    LIVING CENTER OF&#xD; SOUTHERN CAL., INC. &#xD; &#xD; Syllabus&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; amendments to
    CMS. Before the agency finished its review, Medi-&#xD; caid providers and beneficiaries sought,
    in a series of cases, to enjoin&#xD; the rate reductions on the ground that they were pre-empted
    by fed-&#xD; eral Medicaid law. In seven decisions, the Ninth Circuit ultimately&#xD; affirmed
    or ordered preliminary injunctions preventing the State&#xD; from implementing its statutes. The
    court (1) held that the providers&#xD; and beneficiaries could bring a Supremacy Clause action;
    (2) essen-&#xD; tially accepted their claim that the State did not show that its&#xD; amended
    plan would provide sufficient services; (3) held that the&#xD; amendments thus conflicted with
    §1396a(a)(30)(A); and (4) held that&#xD; the federal statute pre-empted the new state laws. In
    the meantime,&#xD; agency officials disapproved the amendments, and California sought&#xD;
    further administrative review. The cases were in this posture when&#xD; the Court granted
    certiorari to decide whether respondents could&#xD; mount a Supremacy Clause challenge. After
    oral argument, CMS&#xD; approved several of the State’s amendments, and the State withdrew&#xD;
    its requests for approval of the remainder.&#xD; Held: The judgments are vacated and the cases
    are remanded, thereby&#xD; permitting the parties to argue before the Ninth Circuit in the
    first&#xD; instance the question whether respondents may maintain Supremacy&#xD; Clause actions
    now that CMS has approved the state statutes. Pp.&#xD; 5–8.&#xD; (a) CMS’ approval does not make
    these cases moot, but it does put&#xD; them in a different posture, since the federal agency
    charged with&#xD; administering Medicaid has now found that the rate reductions com-&#xD; ply
    with federal law. That decision does not change the substantive&#xD; question whether
    California’s statutes are consistent with federal&#xD; law, but it may change the answer. It may
    also require respondents&#xD; to seek review of CMS’ determination under the Administrative
    Pro-&#xD; cedure Act (APA) rather than in a Supremacy Clause action against&#xD; California. The
    APA would likely permit respondents to obtain an&#xD; authoritative judicial determination of
    the merits of their legal claim.&#xD; And their basic challenge now presents the kind of legal
    question or-&#xD; dinarily calling for APA review. The Medicaid Act commits to a fed-&#xD; eral
    agency the power to administer a federal program, and the agen-&#xD; cy has exercised that
    authority. As CMS is comparatively expert in&#xD; the statute’s subject matter, its decision
    carries weight. And&#xD; §1396a(a)(30)(A)’s broad and general language suggests that CMS’&#xD;
    expertise is relevant in determining the provision’s application. Fi-&#xD; nally, to allow a
    Supremacy Clause action to proceed once CMS has&#xD; reached a decision threatens potential
    inconsistency or confusion.&#xD; The Ninth Circuit declined to give weight to the Federal
    Govern-&#xD; ment’s interpretation of the federal law, but courts are ordinarily re-&#xD; quired
    to apply deference standards to agency decisionmaking. The&#xD; Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)
    3&#xD; &#xD; Syllabus&#xD; &#xD; parties suggest no reasons why such standards should not be
    applied&#xD; here or why, now that CMS has acted, a court should reach a differ-&#xD; ent result
    in an APA action than in a Supremacy Clause action. That&#xD; would make the Supremacy Clause
    challenge at best redundant.&#xD; Permitting it to continue would seem inefficient, for the
    federal agen-&#xD; cy is not a participant in the action, which will decide whether&#xD;
    agency-approved state rates violate federal law. Pp. 5–8.&#xD; (b) Given the present posture of
    the cases, the Court does not ad-&#xD; dress whether the Ninth Circuit properly recognized a
    Supremacy&#xD; Clause action to enforce the federal law before the agency took final&#xD;
    action. To decide whether these cases may proceed under the Su-&#xD; premacy Clause now that the
    agency has acted, it will be necessary&#xD; on remand to consider at least the matters addressed

    MEMORIAL HOSPITAL ET AL.&#xD; ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&#xD; APPEALS
    FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&#xD; [February 22, 2012]&#xD; &#xD; JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion
    of the Court.&#xD; We granted certiorari in these cases to decide whether&#xD; Medicaid
    providers and recipients may maintain a cause&#xD; of action under the Supremacy Clause to
    enforce a federal&#xD; Medicaid law—a federal law that, in their view, conflicts&#xD; 2 DOUGLAS
    v. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF&#xD; SOUTHERN CAL., INC. &#xD; &#xD; Opinion of the Court &#xD;
    &#xD; &#xD; with (and pre-empts) state Medicaid statutes that reduce&#xD; payments to providers.
    Since we granted certiorari, how-&#xD; ever, the relevant circumstances have changed. The
    fed-&#xD; eral agency in charge of administering Medicaid, the Cen-&#xD; ters for Medicare &amp;
    Medicaid Services (CMS), has now&#xD; approved the state statutes as consistent with the
    federal&#xD; law. In light of the changed circumstances, we believe&#xD; that the question
    before us now is whether, once the agen-&#xD; cy has approved the state statutes, groups of
    Medicaid&#xD; providers and beneficiaries may still maintain a Suprem-&#xD; acy Clause action
    asserting that the state statutes are&#xD; inconsistent with the federal Medicaid law. For the
    rea-&#xD; sons set forth below, we vacate the Ninth Circuit’s judg-&#xD; ments and remand these
    cases for proceedings consistent&#xD; with this opinion.&#xD; I&#xD; &#xD; A&#xD; &#xD; Medicaid
    is a cooperative federal-state program that&#xD; provides medical care to needy individuals. To
    qualify&#xD; for federal funds, States must submit to a federal agency&#xD; (CMS, a division of
    the Department of Health and Human&#xD; Services) a state Medicaid plan that details the nature
    and&#xD; scope of the State’s Medicaid program. It must also sub-&#xD; mit any amendments to the
    plan that it may make from&#xD; time to time. And it must receive the agency’s approval of&#xD;
    the plan and any amendments. Before granting approval,&#xD; the agency reviews the State’s plan
    and amendments to&#xD; determine whether they comply with the statutory and&#xD; regulatory
    requirements governing the Medicaid program.&#xD; See 42 U. S. C. §§1316(a)(1), (b), 1396a(a),
    (b); 42 CFR&#xD; §430.10 et seq. (2010); Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn.,&#xD; 496 U. S. 498,
    502 (1990). And the agency’s director has&#xD; specified that the agency will not provide
    federal funds for&#xD; any state plan amendment until the agency approves the&#xD; amendment.
    See Letter from Timothy M. Westmoreland,&#xD; Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012) 3&#xD; &#xD;
    Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; Director, Center for Medicaid &amp; State Operations,
    Health&#xD; Care Financing Admin., U. S. Dept. of Health and Human&#xD; Servs., to State
    Medicaid Director (Jan. 2, 2001), online at&#xD; http://www.cms.gov/SMDL/downloads/SMD010201.pdf
    (as&#xD; visited Feb. 17, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court’s case&#xD; file).&#xD; The
    federal statutory provision relevant here says that a&#xD; State’s Medicaid plan and amendments
    must:&#xD; “provide such methods and procedures relating to the&#xD; utilization of, and the
    payment for, care and services&#xD; available under the plan . . . as may be necessary to&#xD;
    safeguard against unnecessary utilization of such care&#xD; and services and to assure that
    payments are con-&#xD; sistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care&#xD; and are
    sufficient to enlist enough providers so that&#xD; care and services are available under the
    plan at least&#xD; to the extent that such care and services are available&#xD; to the general
    population in the geographic area.” 42&#xD; U. S. C. §1396a(a)(30)(A) (emphasis added).&#xD;
    B&#xD; In 2008 and 2009, the California Legislature passed&#xD; three statutes changing that
    State’s Medicaid plan. The&#xD; first statute, enacted in February 2008, reduced by 10%&#xD;
    payments that the State makes to various Medicaid pro-&#xD; viders, such as physicians,
    pharmacies, and clinics. See&#xD; 2007–2008 Cal. Sess. Laws, 3d Extraordinary Sess. ch. 3,&#xD;
    §§14, 15. The second statute, enacted in September 2008,&#xD; replaced the 10% rate reductions
    with a more modest set&#xD; of cuts. See 2008 Cal. Sess. Laws ch. 758, §§45, 57. And&#xD; the
    last statute, enacted in February 2009, placed a cap on&#xD; the State’s maximum contribution to
    wages and benefits&#xD; paid by counties to providers of in-home supportive ser-&#xD; vices. See
    2009–2010 Cal. Sess. Laws, 3d Extraordinary&#xD; Sess. ch. 13, §9.&#xD; In September and
    December 2008, the State submitted&#xD; 4 DOUGLAS v. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF&#xD; SOUTHERN
    CAL., INC. &#xD; &#xD; Opinion of the Court &#xD; &#xD; &#xD; to the federal agency a series of
    plan amendments de-&#xD; signed to implement most of the reductions contained in&#xD; these
    bills. Before the agency finished reviewing the&#xD; amendments, however, groups of Medicaid
    providers and&#xD; beneficiaries filed a series of lawsuits seeking to enjoin the&#xD; rate
    reductions on the ground that they conflicted with,&#xD; and therefore were pre-empted by,
    federal Medicaid law,&#xD; in particular the statutory provision that we have just&#xD; set
    forth. They argued that California’s Medicaid plan&#xD; amendments were inconsistent with the
    federal provision&#xD; because the State had failed to study whether the rate&#xD; reductions
    would be consistent with the statutory factors&#xD; of efficiency, economy, quality, and access
    to care. In&#xD; effect, they argued that California had not shown that its&#xD; Medicaid plan,
    as amended, would “enlist enough provid-&#xD; ers” to make Medicaid “care and services”
    sufficiently&#xD; available. 42 U. S. C. §1396a(a)(30)(A).&#xD; The consolidated cases before us
    encompass five law-&#xD; suits brought by Medicaid providers and beneficiaries&#xD; against
    state officials. Those cases produced seven deci-&#xD; sions of the Court of Appeals for the
    Ninth Circuit. See&#xD; 572 F. 3d 644 (2009); 342 Fed. Appx. 306 (2009); 596 F. 3d&#xD; 1098
    (2010); 563 F. 3d 847 (2009); 374 Fed. Appx. 690&#xD; (2010); 596 F. 3d 1087 (2010); and 380
    Fed. Appx. 656&#xD; (2010). The decisions ultimately affirmed or ordered&#xD; preliminary
    injunctions that prevented the State from im-&#xD; plementing its statutes. They (1) held that
    the Medi-&#xD; caid providers and beneficiaries could directly bring an&#xD; action based on the
    Supremacy Clause; (2) essentially&#xD; accepted the claim that the State had not
    demonstrated&#xD; that its Medicaid plan, as amended, would provide suffi-&#xD; cient services;
    (3) held that the amendments consequently&#xD; conflicted with the statutory provision we have
    quoted;&#xD; and (4) held that, given the Constitution’s Supremacy&#xD; Clause, the federal
    statute must prevail. That is to say,&#xD; the federal statute pre-empted the State’s new
    laws.&#xD; Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012) 5&#xD; &#xD; Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; In the
    meantime, the federal agency was also reviewing&#xD; the same state statutes to determine
    whether they satis-&#xD; fied the same federal statutory conditions. In November&#xD; 2010,
    agency officials concluded that they did not sat-&#xD; isfy those conditions, and the officials
    disapproved the&#xD; amendments. California then exercised its right to further&#xD;
    administrative review within the agency. The cases were&#xD; in this posture when we granted
    certiorari to decide&#xD; whether respondents could mount a Supremacy Clause&#xD; challenge to
    the state statutes and obtain a court injunc-&#xD; tion preventing California from implementing
    its statutes.&#xD; About a month after we heard oral argument, the feder-&#xD; al agency
    reversed course and approved several of Califor-&#xD; nia’s statutory amendments to its plan.
    See Letter from&#xD; Donald M. Berwick, Administrator, CMS, to Toby Douglas,&#xD; Director, Cal.
    Dept. of Health Care Servs. (Oct. 27, 2011);&#xD; Letter from Larry Reed, Director, Division of
    Pharmacy,&#xD; Disabled and Elderly Health Programs Group, CMS, to&#xD; Toby Douglas, Director,
    Cal. Dept. of Health Care Servs.&#xD; (Oct. 27, 2011). In doing so, the agency also approved
    a&#xD; limited retroactive implementation of some of the amend-&#xD; ments’ rate reductions. The
    State, in turn, withdrew its&#xD; requests for approval of the remaining amendments, in&#xD;
    effect agreeing (with one exception) that it would not seek&#xD; to implement any unapproved
    reduction. See Letter from&#xD; Michael E. Kilpatrick, Assistant Chief Counsel, Cal. Dept.&#xD;
    of Health Care Servs., to Benjamin R. Cohen, Director,&#xD; Office of Hearings, CMS (Oct. 27,
    2011). (The exception&#xD; consists of one statute for which California has submitted&#xD; no
    amendment and which, by its own terms, cannot take&#xD; effect unless and until this litigation
    is complete, see 2010&#xD; Cal. Sess. Laws ch. 725, §25.)&#xD; II&#xD; All parties agree that
    the agency’s approval of the en-&#xD; joined rate reductions does not make these cases
    moot.&#xD; 6 DOUGLAS v. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF&#xD; SOUTHERN CAL., INC. &#xD; &#xD;
    Opinion of the Court &#xD; &#xD; &#xD; For one thing, the providers and beneficiaries continue
    to&#xD; believe that the reductions violate the federal provision,&#xD; the agency’s view to the
    contrary notwithstanding. For&#xD; another, federal-court injunctions remain in place,
    forbid-&#xD; ding California to implement the agency-approved rate&#xD; reductions. And, in
    light of the agency’s action, California&#xD; may well ask the lower courts to set those
    injunctions&#xD; aside.&#xD; While the cases are not moot, they are now in a different&#xD;
    posture. The federal agency charged with administering&#xD; the Medicaid program has determined
    that the challenged&#xD; rate reductions comply with federal law. That agency&#xD; decision does
    not change the underlying substantive ques-&#xD; tion, namely whether California’s statutes are
    consistent&#xD; with a specific federal statutory provision (requiring that&#xD; reimbursement
    rates be “sufficient to enlist enough pro-&#xD; viders”). But it may change the answer. And it
    may&#xD; require respondents now to proceed by seeking review of&#xD; the agency determination
    under the Administrative Pro-&#xD; cedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. §701 et seq., rather than in
    an&#xD; action against California under the Supremacy Clause.&#xD; For one thing, the APA would
    likely permit respondents&#xD; to obtain an authoritative judicial determination of the&#xD;
    merits of their legal claim. The Act provides for judicial&#xD; review of final agency action.
    §704. It permits any person&#xD; adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action to obtain&#xD;
    judicial review of the lawfulness of that action. §702. And&#xD; it requires a reviewing court
    to set aside agency action&#xD; found to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,&#xD;
    or otherwise not in accordance with law.” §706(2)(A).&#xD; For another thing, respondents’ basic
    challenge now&#xD; presents the kind of legal question that ordinarily calls for&#xD; APA
    review. The Medicaid Act commits to the federal&#xD; agency the power to administer a federal
    program. And&#xD; here the agency has acted under this grant of authority.&#xD; That decision
    carries weight. After all, the agency is&#xD; Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012) 7&#xD; &#xD;
    Opinion of the Court&#xD; &#xD; comparatively expert in the statute’s subject matter. And&#xD;
    the language of the particular provision at issue here is&#xD; broad and general, suggesting
    that the agency’s expertise&#xD; is relevant in determining its application.&#xD; Finally, to
    allow a Supremacy Clause action to proceed&#xD; once the agency has reached a decision threatens
    potential&#xD; inconsistency or confusion. In these cases, for example,&#xD; the Ninth Circuit,
    in sustaining respondents’ challenges,&#xD; declined to give weight to the Federal Government’s
    inter-&#xD; pretation of the federal statutory language. (That view&#xD; was expressed in an
    amicus curiae brief that the United&#xD; States submitted in prior litigation.) See
    Independent&#xD; Living Center of Southern Cal., Inc. v. Maxwell-Jolly, 572&#xD; F. 3d 644, 654
    (CA9 2009) (referring to the United States’&#xD; certiorari-stage invitation brief in Belshe v.
    Orthopaedic&#xD; Hospital, 522 U. S. 1044 (1998) (denying writ of certiora-&#xD; ri)). And the
    District Court decisions that underlie injunc-&#xD; tions that now forbid California to
    implement its laws may&#xD; rest upon similar analysis.&#xD; But ordinarily review of agency
    action requires courts&#xD; to apply certain standards of deference to agency deci-&#xD;
    sionmaking. See National Cable &amp; Telecommunications&#xD; Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services,
    545 U. S. 967 (2005)&#xD; (describing deference reviewing courts must show); Chev-&#xD; ron U.
    S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,&#xD; Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984) (same). And the
    parties have&#xD; not suggested reasons why courts should not now (in the&#xD; changed posture
    of these cases) apply those ordinary&#xD; standards of deference.&#xD; Nor have the parties
    suggested reasons why, once the&#xD; agency has taken final action, a court should reach a&#xD;
    different result in a case like this one, depending upon&#xD; whether the case proceeds in a
    Supremacy Clause action&#xD; rather than under the APA for review of an agency deci-&#xD; sion.
    Indeed, to permit a difference in result here would&#xD; subject the States to conflicting
    interpretations of federal&#xD; 8 DOUGLAS v. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF&#xD; &#xD; SOUTHERN
    CAL., INC. &#xD; &#xD; Opinion of the Court &#xD; &#xD; &#xD; law by several different courts
    (and the agency), thereby&#xD; threatening to defeat the uniformity that Congress in-&#xD;
    tended by centralizing administration of the federal pro-&#xD; gram in the agency and to make
    superfluous or to under-&#xD; mine traditional APA review. Cf. Astra USA, Inc. v. Santa&#xD;
    Clara County, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 2)&#xD; (noting that the treatment of
    lawsuits that are “in sub-&#xD; stance one and the same” “must be the same, ‘[n]o matter&#xD;
    the clothing in which [plaintiffs] dress their claims’ ” (quot-&#xD; ing Tenet v. Doe, 544 U. S.
    1, 8 (2005)). If the two kinds of&#xD; actions should reach the same result, the Supremacy&#xD;
    Clause challenge is at best redundant. And to permit the&#xD; continuation of the action in that
    form would seem to be&#xD; inefficient, for the agency is not a participant in the pend-&#xD;
    ing litigation below, litigation that will decide whether the&#xD; agency-approved state rates
    violate the federal statute.&#xD; III&#xD; In the present posture of these cases, we do not
    address&#xD; whether the Ninth Circuit properly recognized a Suprem-&#xD; acy Clause action to
    enforce this federal statute before the&#xD; agency took final action. To decide whether these
    cases&#xD; may proceed directly under the Supremacy Clause now&#xD; that the agency has acted,
    it will be necessary to take&#xD; account, in light of the proceedings that have already&#xD;
    taken place, of at least the matters we have set forth&#xD; above. It must be recognized,
    furthermore, that the par-&#xD; ties have not fully argued this question. Thus, it may be&#xD;
    that not all of the considerations that may bear upon the&#xD; proper resolution of the issue
    have been presented in the&#xD; briefs to this Court or in the arguments addressed to and&#xD;
    considered by the Court of Appeals. Given the complexity&#xD; of these cases, rather than
    ordering reargument, we va-&#xD; cate the Ninth Circuit’s judgments and remand the cases,&#xD;
    thereby permitting the parties to argue the matter before&#xD; that Circuit in the first
    instance.&#xD; It is so ordered.&#xD; Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012) 1&#xD; &#xD; ROBERTS, C.

    FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&#xD; [February 22, 2012]&#xD; &#xD; CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom
    JUSTICE SCALIA,&#xD; JUSTICE THOMAS, and JUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.&#xD; The Medicaid Act
    established a collaborative federal-&#xD; state program to assist the poor, elderly, and
    disabled in&#xD; obtaining medical care. The Act is Spending Clause legis-&#xD; 2 DOUGLAS v.
    INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF&#xD; SOUTHERN CAL., INC.&#xD; ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD;
    lation; in exchange for federal funds a State agrees to&#xD; abide by specified rules in
    implementing the program.&#xD; One of those rules is set forth in §30(A) of the Act, which&#xD;
    requires States to meet particular criteria in establishing&#xD; Medicaid reimbursement rates
    for those providing services&#xD; under the Act. 42 U. S. C. §1396a(a)(30)(A). In 2008 and&#xD;
    2009, California enacted legislation reducing the rates at&#xD; which it would compensate some
    providers. Certain pro-&#xD; viders and individuals receiving Medicaid benefits thought&#xD; the
    new reimbursement rates did not comply with the&#xD; criteria set forth in §30(A). They sued the
    State to prevent&#xD; the new rates from going into effect.&#xD; But those plaintiffs faced a
    significant problem: Nothing&#xD; in the Medicaid Act allows providers or beneficiaries&#xD; (or
    anyone else, for that matter) to sue to enforce §30(A).&#xD; The Act instead vests
    responsibility for enforcement&#xD; with a federal agency, the Centers for Medicare &amp;
    Medicaid&#xD; Services (CMS). See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. §1316(a)(1). That is&#xD; settled law in
    the Ninth Circuit. See Sanchez v. Johnson,&#xD; 416 F. 3d 1051, 1058–1062 (2005) (“[T]he
    flexible, admin-&#xD; istrative standards embodied in [§30(A)] do not reflect a&#xD;
    Congressional intent to provide a private remedy for their&#xD; violation”). And it is the law
    in virtually every other cir-&#xD; cuit as well. See, e.g., Long Term Care Pharmacy Alli-&#xD;
    ance v. Ferguson, 362 F. 3d 50, 57–59 (CA1 2004) (holding&#xD; that it would be inconsistent
    with this Court’s precedent to&#xD; find that §30(A) creates rights enforceable by private&#xD;
    parties). The respondents have never argued the contrary.&#xD; Thus, as this case comes to us,
    the federal rule is that&#xD; Medicaid reimbursement rates must meet certain criteria,&#xD; but
    private parties have no statutory right to sue to en-&#xD; force those requirements in
    court.&#xD; The providers and beneficiaries sought to overcome that&#xD; difficulty by arguing
    that they could proceed against the&#xD; State directly under the Supremacy Clause of the
    Consti-&#xD; tution, even if they could not do so under the Act. They&#xD; Cite as: 565 U. S.
    ____ (2012) 3&#xD; &#xD; ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD; contended that the new state
    reimbursement rates were&#xD; inconsistent with the requirements of §30(A). The Su-&#xD; premacy
    Clause provides that a federal statute such as&#xD; §30(A) preempts contrary state law.
    Therefore, the pro-&#xD; viders and beneficiaries claimed, they could sue to enforce&#xD; the
    Supremacy Clause, which requires striking down the&#xD; state law and giving effect to §30(A).
    The Ninth Circuit&#xD; agreed with this argument and blocked the new state&#xD; reimbursement
    rates.&#xD; During briefing and argument in this case, the parties&#xD; have debated broad
    questions, such as whether and when&#xD; constitutional provisions as a general matter are
    directly&#xD; enforceable. It is not necessary to consider these larger&#xD; issues. It is not
    even necessary to decide whether the&#xD; Supremacy Clause can ever provide a private cause
    of&#xD; action. The question presented in the certiorari petitions&#xD; is narrow: “Whether
    Medicaid recipients and providers&#xD; may maintain a cause of action under the Supremacy&#xD;
    Clause to enforce [§30(A)] by asserting that the provision&#xD; preempts a state law reducing
    reimbursement rates.” To&#xD; decide this case, it is enough to conclude that the Suprem-&#xD;
    acy Clause does not provide a cause of action to enforce&#xD; the requirements of §30(A) when
    Congress, in establishing&#xD; those requirements, elected not to provide such a cause of&#xD;
    action in the statute itself.&#xD; The Supremacy Clause operates differently than other&#xD;
    constitutional provisions. For example, if Congress says in&#xD; a law that certain provisions
    do not give rise to a taking&#xD; without just compensation, that obviously does not
    resolve&#xD; a claim under the Takings Clause that they do. The Su-&#xD; premacy Clause, on the
    other hand, is “not a source of any&#xD; federal rights.” Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights&#xD;
    Organization, 441 U. S. 600, 613 (1979); accord, Dennis v.&#xD; Higgins, 498 U. S. 439, 450
    (1991) (contrasting, in this&#xD; regard, the Supremacy Clause and the Commerce Clause).&#xD;
    The purpose of the Supremacy Clause is instead to ensure&#xD; 4 DOUGLAS v. INDEPENDENT LIVING
    CENTER OF&#xD; SOUTHERN CAL., INC. &#xD; &#xD; ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; that,
    in a conflict with state law, whatever Congress says&#xD; goes. See The Federalist, No. 33, p.
    205 (C. Rossiter ed.&#xD; 1961) (A. Hamilton) (the Supremacy Clause “only declares&#xD; a truth
    which flows immediately and necessarily from the&#xD; institution of a federal
    government”).&#xD; Thus, if Congress does not intend for a statute to supply&#xD; a cause of
    action for its enforcement, it makes no sense to&#xD; claim that the Supremacy Clause itself
    must provide one.&#xD; Saying that there is a private right of action under the&#xD; Supremacy
    Clause would substantively change the federal&#xD; rule established by Congress in the Medicaid
    Act. That is&#xD; not a proper role for the Supremacy Clause, which simply&#xD; ensures that the
    rule established by Congress controls.&#xD; Indeed, to say that there is a federal statutory
    right&#xD; enforceable under the Supremacy Clause, when there is no&#xD; such right under the
    pertinent statute itself, would effect&#xD; a complete end-run around this Court’s implied right
    of&#xD; action and 42 U. S. C. §1983 jurisprudence. We have em-&#xD; phasized that “where the
    text and structure of a statute&#xD; provide no indication that Congress intends to create&#xD;
    new individual rights, there is no basis for a private suit,&#xD; whether under §1983 or under
    an implied right of action.”&#xD; Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U. S. 273, 286 (2002). This&#xD;
    body of law would serve no purpose if a plaintiff could&#xD; overcome the absence of a statutory
    right of action simply&#xD; by invoking a right of action under the Supremacy Clause&#xD; to the
    exact same effect. Cf. Astra USA, Inc. v. Santa&#xD; Clara County, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)
    (slip op., at 7)&#xD; (rejecting contention that contract incorporating statutory&#xD; terms
    could be enforced in private action when statute&#xD; itself could not be; “[t]he absence of a
    private right to&#xD; enforce the statutory ceiling price obligations would be&#xD; rendered
    meaningless if [contracting] entities could over-&#xD; come that obstacle by suing to enforce
    the contract’s ceil-&#xD; ing price obligations instead”).&#xD; The providers and beneficiaries
    argue, however, that the&#xD; Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012) 5&#xD; &#xD; ROBERTS, C. J.,
    dissenting&#xD; &#xD; traditional exercise of equity jurisdiction supports finding&#xD; a direct
    cause of action in the Supremacy Clause. This&#xD; contention fails for the same reason. It is a
    longstand-&#xD; ing maxim that “[e]quity follows the law.” 1 J. Pomeroy,&#xD; Treatise on Equity
    Jurisprudence §425 (3d ed. 1905). A&#xD; court of equity may not “create a remedy in violation
    of&#xD; law, or even without the authority of law.” Rees v. Water-&#xD; town, 19 Wall. 107, 122
    (1874). Here the law established&#xD; by Congress is that there is no remedy available to
    private&#xD; parties to enforce the federal rules against the State. For&#xD; a court to reach a
    contrary conclusion under its general&#xD; equitable powers would raise the most serious
    concerns&#xD; regarding both the separation of powers (Congress, not&#xD; the Judiciary, decides
    whether there is a private right of&#xD; action to enforce a federal statute) and federalism
    (the&#xD; States under the Spending Clause agree only to conditions&#xD; clearly specified by
    Congress, not any implied on an ad hoc&#xD; basis by the courts).&#xD; This is not to say that
    federal courts lack equitable&#xD; powers to enforce the supremacy of federal law when such&#xD;
    action gives effect to the federal rule, rather than con-&#xD; travening it. The providers and
    beneficiaries rely heavily&#xD; on cases of this kind, most prominently Ex parte Young,&#xD; 209
    U. S. 123 (1908). Those cases, however, present quite&#xD; different questions involving “the
    pre-emptive assertion in&#xD; equity of a defense that would otherwise have been avail-&#xD;
    able in the State’s enforcement proceedings at law.” Vir-&#xD; ginia Office for Protection and
    Advocacy v. Stewart, 563&#xD; U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (slip op., at&#xD;
    1). Nothing of that sort is at issue here; the respondents&#xD; are not subject to or threatened
    with any enforcement&#xD; proceeding like the one in Ex parte Young. They simply&#xD; seek a
    private cause of action Congress chose not to&#xD; provide.&#xD; 6 DOUGLAS v. INDEPENDENT LIVING
    CENTER OF&#xD; SOUTHERN CAL., INC. &#xD; &#xD; ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; * *
    *&#xD; The Court decides not to decide the question on which&#xD; we granted certiorari but
    instead to send the cases back to&#xD; the Court of Appeals, because of the recent action by
    CMS&#xD; approving California’s new reimbursement rates. But the&#xD; CMS approvals have no
    impact on the question before this&#xD; Court. If, as I believe, there is no private right of
    action&#xD; under the Supremacy Clause to enforce §30(A), that is the&#xD; end of the matter.
    If, on the other hand, the Court be-&#xD; lieves that there is such a cause of action, but that
    CMS’s&#xD; recent rate approvals may have an effect on that action&#xD; going forward, then the
    Court should say just that and&#xD; then remand to the Ninth Circuit for consideration of
    the&#xD; effect of the agency approvals.&#xD; I am not sure what a remand without answering
    the&#xD; preliminary question is meant to accomplish. The major-&#xD; ity claims that the
    agency’s recent action “may change the&#xD; [lower courts’] answer” to the question whether the
    partic-&#xD; ular state rates violate §30(A). Ante, at 6. But that fact-&#xD; specific question
    is not the one before us; we chose not to&#xD; grant certiorari on the question whether
    California’s rates&#xD; complied with §30(A), limiting our grant to the cause of&#xD; action
    question. 562 U. S. ___ (2011).&#xD; The majority also asserts that the lower courts must&#xD;
    “decide whether these cases may proceed directly under&#xD; the Supremacy Clause now that the
    agency has acted.”&#xD; Ante, at 8. The majority contends that the parties have&#xD; not “fully
    argued this question.” Ibid. But the agency&#xD; proceedings that ultimately led to the CMS
    approvals&#xD; were well underway when this Court granted certiorari.&#xD; The parties debated
    the import of the parallel adminis-&#xD; trative proceedings in their initial briefs and at oral
    ar-&#xD; gument. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 28–29 (“Private&#xD; lawsuits . . . interfere
    with . . . CMS’s own enforcement&#xD; procedures,” as is “vividly demonstrated in the
    present&#xD; cases”); Brief for Respondents Santa Rosa Memorial Hos-&#xD; Cite as: 565 U. S.
    ____ (2012) 7&#xD; &#xD; ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD; pital et al. in No.10–283, p. 46
    (“This case vividly illus-&#xD; trates why the [administrative] enforcement scheme . . .&#xD;
    cannot substitute for a constitutional preemption claim”).&#xD; No party—nor the United States
    as amicus curiae—&#xD; argued that any action by CMS would affect the answer to&#xD; the
    question we granted certiorari to review. See, e.g., Tr.&#xD; of Oral Arg. 53–54 (counsel for
    respondents) (arguing that,&#xD; “to be sure,” there would be a cause of action under the&#xD;
    Supremacy Clause even after the agency took action on&#xD; the challenged rates).&#xD; Once the
    CMS approvals were issued, this Court di-&#xD; rected the parties to file supplemental briefs to
    address&#xD; “the effect, if any, of the [CMS approvals] on the proper&#xD; disposition of this
    case.” 565 U. S. ___ (2011). Again, no&#xD; one argued on supplemental briefing that the CMS
    ap-&#xD; provals affected the answer to the question before this&#xD; Court. See, e.g., Supp.
    Letter Brief for Certain Respond-&#xD; ents 6 (“The CMS findings do not directly resolve
    whether&#xD; the Constitution supports a right of action”); Supp. Letter&#xD; Brief for
    Petitioner 6 (agreeing that “if a preemption cause&#xD; of action may be stated here against the
    State, [CMS]&#xD; approval may affect its merits but not its existence”). It&#xD; seems odd,
    then, to claim that the parties have not had the&#xD; opportunity to fully address the impact of
    the agency&#xD; action on the question that we granted certiorari to re-&#xD; view: whether the
    Ninth Circuit correctly recognized a&#xD; private cause of action under the Supremacy Clause
    to&#xD; enforce §30(A).&#xD; So what is the Court of Appeals to do on remand? It&#xD; could
    change its view and decide that there is no cause of&#xD; action directly under the Supremacy
    Clause to enforce&#xD; §30(A). The majority itself provides a compelling list of&#xD; reasons
    for such a result: “The Medicaid Act commits to&#xD; the federal agency the power to administer
    a federal pro-&#xD; gram”; “the agency is comparatively expert in the statute’s&#xD; subject
    matter”; “the language of the particular provision&#xD; 8 DOUGLAS v. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER
    OF&#xD; SOUTHERN CAL., INC. &#xD; &#xD; ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; at issue
    here is broad and general, suggesting that the&#xD; agency’s expertise is relevant”; and APA
    review would&#xD; provide “an authoritative judicial determination.” Ante, at&#xD; 6–7. Allowing
    for both Supremacy Clause actions and&#xD; agency enforcement “threatens potential inconsistency
    or&#xD; confusion,” and imperils “the uniformity that Congress&#xD; intended by centralizing
    administration of the federal&#xD; program in the agency.” Ante, at 7–8; see Gonzaga, 536&#xD;
    U. S., at 291–293 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment)&#xD; (explaining that Congress often
    means to preclude a pri-&#xD; vate right of action in statutes where it employs an ad-&#xD;
    ministrative enforcement scheme that achieves “expertise,&#xD; uniformity, widespread
    consultation, and resulting admin-&#xD; istrative guidance,” while “avoid[ing] the comparative
    risk&#xD; of inconsistent interpretations and misincentives that can&#xD; arise out of an
    occasional inappropriate application of the&#xD; statute in a private action for damages”).&#xD;
    The majority acknowledges, in light of all this, that the&#xD; Supremacy Clause challenge
    appears “at best redundant,”&#xD; and that “continuation of the action in that form would&#xD;
    seem to be inefficient.” Ante, at 8. Still, according to the&#xD; majority, the Court of Appeals
    on remand could determine&#xD; that the Supremacy Clause action may be brought but&#xD; then
    must abate “now that the agency has acted,” ibid.—&#xD; as everyone knew the agency would. A
    Court concerned&#xD; with “inefficien[cy]” should not find that result very pal-&#xD; atable,
    and the majority cites no precedent for a cause of&#xD; action that fades away once a federal
    agency has acted.&#xD; Such a scenario would also create a bizarre rush to the&#xD; courthouse,
    as litigants seek to file and have their Su-&#xD; premacy Clause causes of action decided before
    the agency&#xD; has time to arrive at final agency action reviewable in&#xD; court.&#xD; Or
    perhaps the suits should continue in a different&#xD; “form,” by which I understand the Court to
    suggest that&#xD; they should morph into APA actions. The APA judicial&#xD; Cite as: 565 U. S.
    ____ (2012) 9&#xD; &#xD; ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&#xD; &#xD; review provisions, however, seem
    to stand in the way of&#xD; such a transformation. To convert the litigation into an&#xD; APA
    suit, the current defendant (the State) would need to&#xD; be dismissed and the agency (which is
    not currently a&#xD; party at all) would have to be sued in its stead. 5 U. S. C.&#xD;
    §§701–706. Given that APA actions also feature—among&#xD; other things—different standards of
    review, different&#xD; records, and different potential remedies, it is difficult to&#xD; see
    what would be left of the original Supremacy Clause&#xD; suit. Or, again, why one should have
    been permitted in&#xD; the first place, when agency review was provided by stat-&#xD; ute, and
    the parties were able to and did participate fully&#xD; in that process.&#xD; I would dispel all
    these difficulties by simply holding&#xD; what the logic of the majority’s own opinion
    suggests:&#xD; When Congress did not intend to provide a private right of&#xD; action to enforce
    a statute enacted under the Spending&#xD; Clause, the Supremacy Clause does not supply one of
    its&#xD; own force. The Ninth Circuit’s decisions to the contrary&#xD; should be reversed.&#xD;
