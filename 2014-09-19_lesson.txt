Introduction

    XML hierarchical structure (Tree format)

    XPath as a language used to identify parts of an XML Document (give broad to specific sequence examples)
    
    When XPath will be used in later course technologies
        Selection of nodes for transformation
    

Path Expressions (taught with continual application to ham.xml)

        Use TEI header

        *Context node*
            Thinking of the steps of the path as changing the context node for the upcoming step
            //text/front/div/head 
            Always important to keep in mind

    
Axes (use of the diamond chart and application to hamlet)

        Document node vs. root (good example /TEI vs. /text)

        Child Axis assumed (shorthand, longhand: child::head)
        
        Child vs. Descendant ; Parent v. Ancestor
        
        Use of the asterisk
        
        Use of the .
            Current context
            .. one parent node
            
        Attribute Axis
            attributes not children, but have parents (can find the element to which it is attached on parent axis)
            
        text() and node ()
             

/TEI/teiHeader/fileDesc/titleStmt/title vs. /TEI//title


Namespaces

    manage different XML vocabularies in the same document.  e.g. two different elements named in schemas as the same thing
    can use namespaces to differentiate while keeping the same tag.  Can use prefixes that require the definition of namespaces.
    Points to namespace information as well.
