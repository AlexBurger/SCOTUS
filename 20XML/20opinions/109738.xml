It is ordered that the Honorable Robert Van Pelt, Senior Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska, is appointed Special Master in this case with authority to fix the time and conditions for the filing of additional pleadings and to direct subsequent proceedings, and with authority to summon witnesses, issue subpoenas, and take such evidence as may be introduced and such as he may deem necessary to call for. The master is directed to submit such reports as he may deem appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
