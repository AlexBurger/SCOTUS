 excuse which had often been offered by bureaucrats that their&#xD;
 statutory authority did not authorize consideration of such&#xD;
 factors in their policy decisions. See Udall v. Federal Power&#xD;

 certain procedures into their operating routines in order (1) to&#xD;
 increase the likelihood that environmental consequences of agency&#xD;
 action will not be unforeseen and (2) to insure that if a project&#xD;
 is approved, an environmentally acceptable alternative will be&#xD;
 chosen. Section 102(2)(C) requires a detailed statement in&#xD;
 connection with actions significantly affecting the quality of the&#xD;
 human environment, specifying the environmental impact of the&#xD;
 proposed action and alternatives. Section 102(2)(D) places bureaus&#xD;
 under an affirmative duty to study and develop alternatives where&#xD;
 there are unresolved conflicts concerning the alternative uses of&#xD;
 available resources.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      This case poses issues under both sections. In 1964 Con Ed&#xD;
 proposed to the Commission that it be allowed to construct a&#xD;
 reservoir atop Storm King mountain along with a hydroelectric&#xD;
 generating plant to be driven by water falling from the reservoir.&#xD;
 During the daytime hours when energy demand is high the plant&#xD;
 would be operational, but during the evening hours when part of&#xD;
 Con Ed's existing facilities are normally idle, power from one of&#xD;
 its existing plants would be used to pump water from the Hudson&#xD;
 River to the reservoir. In 1965 the Commission approved the&#xD;
 project but the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in a suit&#xD;
 brought by conservationists and local residents set aside the&#xD;
 order and remanded for more detailed consideration of various&#xD;
 environmental aspects of the project. Scenic Hudson Preservation&#xD;

 &#xD;
      After more hearings had been completed but before the&#xD;
 Commission acted, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969&#xD;
 became effective. Although it has been conceded that the Act's&#xD;
 requirements were applicable in these proceedings, no further&#xD;
 hearings were held; and no environmental impact statement was&#xD;
 drafted. The Commission approved the project and attempted to&#xD;
 satisfy its procedural duties under &amp;#167; 102 by specifying certain&#xD;
 environmental impact forecasts in its final opinion.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      The Court of Appeals affirmed over the dissent of Judge Oakes&#xD;
 who thought that the Commission had not discharged its obligations&#xD;
 under NEPA. The majority held that under &amp;#167; 101 the ultimate&#xD;
 balance of energy and environmental values was the responsibility&#xD;
 of the Commission and courts could upset only decisions not&#xD;
 supported by 'substantial evidence.' It also held, with respect to&#xD;
 the procedural requirements of &amp;#167; 102, that the Commission's&#xD;
 hearings, and consultation with other agencies satisfied the&#xD;
 command that a 'systematic, interdisciplinary approach' be&#xD;
 utilized.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; It also found that the Commission's final opinion which&#xD;
 contained its environmental findings would, under the&#xD;
 circumstances, suffice as an environmental impact statement. A&#xD;
 petition for rehearing &lt;i&gt;en banc&lt;/i&gt; was denied by an equally divided&#xD;
 court with Judge Timbers dissenting in a short opinion which&#xD;
 expressed doubt as to the validity of the majority's reliance on&#xD;
 the 'substantial evidence' test.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      I believe the Court of Appeals gave the Act too restrictive a&#xD;
 meaning. As to the Commission's duty to take environmental impacts&#xD;
 into account, Judge Oakes made a strong case for the view that the&#xD;
 Commission (a) misjudged the risk that project construction might&#xD;
 work irreparable injury to one of&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/div&gt;&#xD;

 three vital water supply systems serving New York City; (b)&#xD;
 underestimated the extent of additional air pollution which would&#xD;
 be generated by nighttime burning of fossil fuels in New York City&#xD;
 in order to generate the power needed to pump the river water to&#xD;
 the reservoir; and (c) generally undervalued environmental&#xD;
 considerations while overvaluing engineering and economic&#xD;
 considerations. Although value judgments are inevitable and even&#xD;
 though the Commission's balancing of environmental costs with&#xD;
 other factors may be entitled to some deference, I share Judge&#xD;
 Timber's doubts that under &amp;#167; 101 the balance struck by an agency&#xD;
 unskilled in environmental matters should be reviewed only through&#xD;
 the lens of the 'substantial evidence' test. Cf. Citizens to&#xD;
 Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ybX/citizens-to-preserve-overton-park-inc-v-volpe/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;401&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;402&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 413, 91 S.Ct. 814,&#xD;
 28 L.Ed.2d 136 ('If the statutes are to have any meaning, the&#xD;
 Secretary cannot approve the destruction of parkland unless he&#xD;
 finds that alternative routes present unique problems.') (But see&#xD;
 &lt;i&gt;Calvert Cliffs'&lt;/i&gt;, 449 F.2d, at 1115.).&#xD;
 &#xD;
      I also am not satisfied that the procedural obligations under&#xD;
 &amp;#167; 102 were honored. First, the Commission did not draft the impact&#xD;
 statement required by &amp;#167; 102(2)(C). Thus when the Commissioners&#xD;
 deliberated the fate of Storm King Mountain, they did not have&#xD;
 before them a coherent study addressed to the environmental&#xD;
 consequences of the project and alternatives to it. Another panel&#xD;
 of the Second Circuit has recently ruled that the impact statement&#xD;
 must be written &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; action is taken. Greene County Planning&#xD;
 Board v. FPC, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca2/2xBb/greene-county-planning-board-v-federal-power-commi/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;455&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;412&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CA2). Administrators cannot attempt to&#xD;
 comply with the Act by calling their final opinion their impact&#xD;
 statement. True, here the hearings had been completed after the&#xD;
 Act became effective. Yet the Commission could have deferred&#xD;
 decision until its own &amp;#167; 102 statement was prepared.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p7"&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;p&gt;Page 932&#xD;
 &#xD;
      Second, the Commission's final opinion suggests that its&#xD;
 consideration of environmental issues is required only when&#xD;
 private citizens bring such problems to the agency's attention.&#xD;
 For example, in many passages of its opinion the Commission states&#xD;
 that particular objections to the project had been rejected for&#xD;
 lack of evidence in the administrative record.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; This approach&#xD;
 symptomatic of the phenomenon of bureaucratic&#xD;
 'industry-mindedness'&amp;#8212;wrongly assumed that a presumption of&#xD;
 validity supported the Con Ed proposal and that environmental&#xD;
 groups had a burden of proof to overcome.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      Similarly, the Commission limited its inquiry primarily to&#xD;
 those program alternatives which had been submitted by the&#xD;
 conservationists opposing the Con Ed project. The agency did not&#xD;
 generate its own alternatives, although Congress charged each&#xD;
 federal agency to represent not only the public interest in&#xD;
 general but also under NEPA to pay particular attention to the&#xD;
 environmental ramifications of its actions. Whether or not&#xD;
 conservationists appear to register dissent, the Commission is&#xD;
 told in &amp;#167; 102(2)(D) to 'study, develop and&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p8"&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;p&gt;Page 933&#xD;
 &#xD;
 describe appropriate alternatives to recommend courses of action.&#xD;
 . . .' The agency is directed to apply its own expertise and&#xD;
 imagination in exploring less drastic alternatives. And, one&#xD;
 alternative, which went completely overlooked by the Commission,&#xD;
 as Judge Oakes noted below, is not to build any project at all.&#xD;
 Whether that option is realistic we do not know. Informing the&#xD;
 public and Congress on that score is the function of the impact&#xD;
 statement. In short, the Act requires that bureaucrats not only to&#xD;
 listen to protests, but to avoid projects that have imprudent&#xD;
 environmental impacts. There is no burden of proof for the&#xD;
 objector to overcome.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      Finally, the Commission's opinion is too imprecise to provide&#xD;
 any helpful insight for Congress, the Council on Environmental&#xD;
 Quality, or the public into what value judgments it made. We know&#xD;
 that the Commission rejected alternatives with less deleterious&#xD;
 environmental consequences on the ground that they were 'more'&#xD;
 costly and 'less' reliable. But we have no reasonably precise&#xD;
 notion of how much reliability and money were gained at the&#xD;
 expense of the destruction of Storm King Mountain. Whether or not&#xD;
 courts may review the Commission's ultimate balance of these&#xD;
 competing considerations, the fact remains that Congress and the&#xD;
 public are entitled to know those judgments. One function of the &amp;#167;&#xD;
 102 statement is certainly to make explicit the priorities of the&#xD;
 agencies. That purpose is not served where all that is basically&#xD;
 told is that the preferred alternative is cheaper and more&#xD;
 reliable, though involving adverse implications for the&#xD;
 surrounding ecology.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      If this kind of impact statement is tolerated, then the&#xD;
 mandate of NEPA becomes only a ritual and like the peppercorn a&#xD;
 mere symbol that has no vital meaning. The decision below is, in&#xD;
 other words, the beginning of the demise of the mandate of NEPA.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      I would grant these petitions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/div&gt;&#xD;

        &lt;p&gt; Section 101 of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42&#xD;
 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 4331, provides in pertinent part:&#xD;
 &#xD;
       '(b) In order to carry out the policy set forth in this&#xD;
 chapter, it is the continuing responsibility of the Federal&#xD;
 Government to use all practicable means, consistent with other&#xD;
 essential considerations of national policy, to improve and&#xD;
 coordinate Federal plans, functions, programs, and resources to&#xD;
 the end that the Nation may&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&#xD;
 &#xD;
       '(1) fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as&#xD;
 trustee of the environment for succeeding generations;&#xD;
 &#xD;
       '(2) assure for all Americans safe, healthful, productive,&#xD;
 and esthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings;&#xD;
 &#xD;
       '(3) attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the&#xD;
 environment without degradation, risk to health or safety, or&#xD;
 other undesirable and unintended consequences;&#xD;
 &#xD;
       '(4) preserve important historic, cultural, and natural&#xD;
 aspects of our national heritage, and maintain, wherever possible,&#xD;
 an environment which supports diversity and variety of individual&#xD;
 choice.'&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.In that case we held that the grant of authority to this&#xD;
 Commission to alienate federal water resources does not turn&#xD;
 simply on whether the project will be beneficial to the licensee.&#xD;
 Nor is the test solely whether the region will be able to use the&#xD;
 additional power. We said 'The test is whether the project will be&#xD;
 in the public interest. And that determination can be made only&#xD;
 after an exploration of all issues relevant to the 'public&#xD;
 interest,' including . . . the public interest in preserving&#xD;
 reaches of wild rivers and wilderness areas, the preservation of&#xD;
 anadromous fish for commercial and recreational purposes, and the&#xD;
 protection of wildlife.' 387 U.S., at 450, 87 S.Ct. 1712.&#xD;
 &#xD;
       The Commission's attitude in that case re-appeared in the&#xD;
 present case: 'Implicit in the reasoning of the Commission and the&#xD;
 Examiner is the assumption that this project must be built and&#xD;
 that it must be built now.' 387 U.S., at 448, 87 S.Ct. 1712.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

       'Prior to making any detailed statement, the responsible&#xD;
