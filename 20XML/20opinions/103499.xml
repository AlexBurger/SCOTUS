      &lt;p&gt;DECREE.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="num" id="p3"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;On consideration of the report filed herein on February 24, 1941, by W. H. Green and O. W. Gauss, the Commissioners appointed herein by decree of this Court entered October 14, 1940 (311 U.S. 1, 61 S.Ct. 2, 85 L.Ed. 3), to locate and mark on the ground the boundary between the State of Arkansas and the State of Tennessee, at the points designated in said decree; and the State of Arkansas and the State of Tennessee having stipulated by counsel that they have no exceptions and no objections to the said report, and they having applied to this Court to terminate the time within which exceptions or objections to said report may be filed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p4"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It is now adjudged, ordered, and decreed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p5"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;1. The time within which exceptions or objections to said report may be filed is hereby terminated;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p6"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;2. The said report is in all respects confirmed;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p7"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;3. The boundary line marked and located on the ground as set forth by the report and accompanying map is established and declared to be the true boundary between the State of Arkansas and the State of Tennessee, as determined by the decree of this Court of October 14, 1940;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p8"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;4. As it appears that the Commissioners have completed their work in conformity with the decree of this Court of October 14, 1940, they are hereby discharged, and their fees and expenses in the amounts stated in the report are approved;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p9"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;5. The Clerk of this Court is directed to transmit to the Chief Magistrates of the States of Arkansas and Tennessee copies of this decree, duly authenticated under the seal of this Court, together with copies of the said report of the Commissioners and of the accompanying map;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p10"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;6. The costs in this cause shall be borne and paid in equal parts by the States of Arkansas and Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;
