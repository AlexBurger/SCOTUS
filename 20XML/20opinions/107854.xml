    &lt;p class="parties"&gt;Thomas W. McARTHUR et al., petitioners,&lt;br&gt;v.&lt;br&gt;Clark CLIFFORD, Secretary of Defense, et al.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="docket"&gt;No. 613.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="court"&gt;Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="date"&gt;December 16, 1968&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="prelims"&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Philip J. Hirschkop, for petitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Solicitor General Griswold, for respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Motions to dispense with printing petition and to amend petition granted. Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit denied.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p1"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;I dissent from a denial of certiorari in this case. An important unresolved constitutional issue of immediate importance to many Americans is involved. It is whether men may be sent abroad to fight in a war which has not been declared by Congress. This is a point on which I wrote a rather elaborate dissent in Holmes v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/y2k/albert-h-holmes-petitioner-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;391&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;936&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 88 S.Ct. 1835, 20 L.Ed.2d 856, and Hart v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/y2n/marvin-vondon-hart-jr-petitioner-v-united/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;391&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;956&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 88 S.Ct. 1851, 20 L.Ed.2d 871. This certainly is a substantial question and one which has never been resolved by this Court.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p2"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The question of the power of the President to conduct a war without a declaration of war was raised in the Prize Cases [The Amy Warwick], &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Black&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;635&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 17 L.Ed. 459, during the Civil War. That was an internal insurrection which would perhaps be analogous here if the Vietnamese were invading the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p3"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It was a five-to-four decision, upholding Presidential power. Would it have been the same if Lincoln had had an expeditionary force fighting a 'war' overseas?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p4"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;There should not be the slightest doubt but that whenever the Chief Executive of the country takes any citizen by the neck and either puts him in prison or subjects him to some ordeal or sends him overseas to fight in a war, the question is a justiciable one. To call issues of that kind 'political' would be to abdicate the judicial function which the Court honored in the midst of the Civil War in the &lt;i&gt;Prize&lt;/i&gt; Cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p5"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The spectre of executive war-making is an ominous threat to our republican institutions. What can be done in Vietnam can be done in many areas o  this troubled world without debate or responsible public decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p6"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;I would put the case down for argument and resolve this important constitutional problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
