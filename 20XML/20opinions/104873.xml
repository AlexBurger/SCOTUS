      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'This cause was argued by counsel at the October Term, 1943, upon the pleadings and exceptions to the Report of the Special Master. On June 5, 1944, this Court entered a decree establishing a boundary between the States. Since the entry of the decree the States of Kansas and Missouri through their legislatures have agreed upon a boundary and such agreement has been ratified by joint resolution of the Congress of the United States and the resolution approved by the President of the United States. Public Law 637, approved August 3, 1950. Therefore, in order to conform this Court's decree to the agreement of the parties as ratified by the Congress of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
