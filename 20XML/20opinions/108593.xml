    &lt;p class="court"&gt;Supreme Court of the United States &#xD;
                         June 12, 1972&#xD;
 &#xD;
      Application for stay.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      The application for stay of judgment of the United States&#xD;
 District Court for the District of Connecticut presented to Mr.&#xD;
 Justice MARSHALL and by him referred to the Court is granted.&#xD;
 &#xD;
 djQ  Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      Appellant seeks to stay the judgment of a three-judge Federal&#xD;
 District Court which held unconstitutional Connecticut's plan for&#xD;
 apportioning its state legislature. 341 F.Supp. 139. The plan was&#xD;
 adopted in September 1971, and was only in the preliminary stages&#xD;
 of implementation when it was struck down as violative of the&#xD;
 Equal Protection Clause on March 30, 1972. An appeal from that&#xD;
 decision has been docketed in this Court. Gaffney v. Cummings, No.&#xD;
 71-1476.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      Mr. Justice STEWART would deny the application.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      We denied a motion for expedited consideration of that appeal&#xD;
 on May 22, 1972. &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;406&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;942&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 92 S.Ct. 2047, 32 L.Ed.2d 330.&#xD;
 Appellant promptly moved the lower court for a stay of its&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;p class="date"&gt;Page 903&#xD;
 &#xD;
 March 30th decision, and when that stay was denied on May 26,&#xD;
 1972, appellant came here.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      Earlier this Term, in another reapportionment case, Mr.&#xD;
 Justice Powell articulated the considerations involved in our&#xD;
 review of applications for a stay of lower court judgments:&#xD;
 &#xD;
      'A lower court judgment, entered by a tribunal that was&#xD;
      closer to the facts . . ., is entitled to a presumption of&#xD;
      validity. Any party seeking a stay of that judgment bears the&#xD;
      burden of showing that the decision below was erroneous and&#xD;
      that the implementation of the judgment pending appeal will&#xD;
      lead to irreparable harm.' Graves v. Barnes, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yg3/curtis-graves-et-al-v-ben-barnes-et-al-diana/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;405&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1201&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&#xD;
      1203, 92 S.Ct. 752, 30 L.Ed.2d 769.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      'Irreparable injury,' of course, inheres in any challenge to&#xD;
 legislative apportionment. If the court below erred, the Fall&#xD;
 election will be held under an improper order, one which will&#xD;
 doubtless affect the composition of the next state legislature.&#xD;
 But this type of 'irreparable injury' affects both sides equally,&#xD;
 for if the court below was correct, staying its order will cause&#xD;
 irreparable harm of precisely the same dimension.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      There is 'irreparable injury' in a different sense if the&#xD;
 court's order striking down a state apportionment is handed down&#xD;
 so near the upcoming election that it is administratively&#xD;
 impractical to implement an orderly election. Here, there is no&#xD;
 serious claim that irreparable injury, in this sense, would result&#xD;
 if a stay is not granted. The court below found as fact that there&#xD;
 is ample time before the Fall election to implement the plan&#xD;
 submitted by the Special Master on May 26, 1972, or any proposed&#xD;
 substitute which the State or appellant might submit within a&#xD;
 reasonable time.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; In-&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p1"&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;p&gt;Page 904&#xD;
 &#xD;
 deed, appellant concedes that the question of which plan can be&#xD;
 most easily implemented is a 'non-issue.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;
 &#xD;
      Thus, the issue determinative of the stay application is the&#xD;
 probable correctness of the decision below, and, in my view,&#xD;
 appellant has not met his burden 'of showing that the decision&#xD;
 below was erroneous.'&#xD;
 &#xD;
      In Reynolds v. Sims, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xLf/b-a-reynolds-etc-et-al-appellants-v-m/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;377&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;533&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 577, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12&#xD;
 L.Ed.2d 506, we said 'the Equal Protection Clause requires that a&#xD;
 State make an honest and good faith effort to construct districts,&#xD;
 in both houses of its legislature, as nearly of equal population&#xD;
 as is practicable.' Moreover, a State may not be heard to argue&#xD;
 that a population variance is justified because it is &lt;i&gt;de minimus&lt;/i&gt;.&#xD;
 '[T]he 'as nearly as practicable' standard requires that the State&#xD;
 make a good faith effort to achieve precise mathematical equality.&#xD;
 . . . Unless population variances among . . . districts are shown&#xD;
 to have resulted despite such effort, the State must justify each&#xD;
 variance, no matter how small.' Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/y5h/kirkpatrick-v-preisler/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;394&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
 &lt;span class="page"&gt;526&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 530-531, 89 S.Ct. 1225, 22 L.Ed.2d 519.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;
 &#xD;
 &#xD;
      A comparison of the population variances in this case with&#xD;
 those disapproved in &lt;i&gt;Kirkpatrick, supra&lt;/i&gt;, is striking. In&#xD;
 &lt;i&gt;Kirkpatrick&lt;/i&gt;, the average variation from the ideal district was&#xD;
 only 1.6%. Here, assembly districts in the State Plan exhibited an&#xD;
 average variation of 1.9%. In &lt;i&gt;Kirkpatrick&lt;/i&gt;, the ratio of the&#xD;
 largest to the smallest district was only 1.06 to 1. Here, the&#xD;
 ratio of the largest to the smallest assembly district is 1.082&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p2"&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;p&gt;Page 905&#xD;
 &#xD;
 to 1. In &lt;i&gt;Kirkpatrick&lt;/i&gt;, 70% of the districts were within plus or&#xD;
 minus 1.88% of the ideal population figure. Here, only 51.65% of&#xD;
 the assembly districts are within 2.0% of the ideal. In&#xD;
 &lt;i&gt;Kirkpatrick&lt;/i&gt;, the total variance&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; was 5.97%. Here, the total&#xD;
 variance of the assembly redistricting is 7.83%.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      It is true, of course that 'the extent to which equality may&#xD;
 practicably be achieved may differ from State to State. . . .,'&#xD;
 &lt;i&gt;Kirkpatrick, supra&lt;/i&gt;, at 530, 84 S.Ct. 1362. Thus a State may be&#xD;
 able to justify certain variations. Here, however, only two&#xD;
 justifications are offered, and neither appear to have particular&#xD;
 merit.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      It is primarily argued that the variations are justified by a&#xD;
 legitimate state interest in achieving 'a partisan balancing of&#xD;
 strength in each house.' The District Court explained the concept&#xD;
 as follows:&#xD;
 &#xD;
      'The partisan balancing of strength in each house, termed by&#xD;
      interveningdefendant [appellant in this Court] a 'fair&#xD;
      political balance' and by plaintiffs [appellees herein]&#xD;
      'political gerrymandering' was obtained by so adjusting the&#xD;
      census areas utilized as building blocks into the structuring&#xD;
      of Senate and House districts that, on the basis of the vote&#xD;
      for all the Senate candidates of each party in the elections&#xD;
      of 1966, 1968 and 1970, whichever party carried the state&#xD;
      should carry a majority of Senate seats proportional to the&#xD;
      statewide party majority, and likewise in the House, based on&#xD;
      the party vote for all the House candidates of each party in&#xD;
      the same three elections.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      'In one or more House and one or more Senate districts some&#xD;
      accommodation was also made in&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p3"&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;p&gt;Page 906&#xD;
 &#xD;
      the interest of retaining in office a particular incumbent.'&#xD;
      341 F.Supp. 139.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      This Court has never decided whether political gerrymandering&#xD;
 or 'fair political balance' is &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; unconstitutional,&#xD;
 irrespective of population variances. See, &lt;i&gt;e. g.&lt;/i&gt;, Wells v.&#xD;
 Rockefeller, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/y5i/wells-v-rockefeller/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;394&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;542&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 544, 89 S.Ct. 1234, 22 L.Ed.2d 535. But&#xD;
 we have said, in no uncertain terms, that gerrymandering is not a&#xD;
 justification where population variances do result. In&#xD;
 &lt;i&gt;Kirkpatrick&lt;/i&gt;, for example, we even rejected the State's attempt&#xD;
 to justify the population variances there present on the ground&#xD;
 that the variations were necessary to &lt;i&gt;avoid&lt;/i&gt; gerrymandering.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      '[A]n argument that deviations from equality are justified in&#xD;
      order to inhibit legislators from engaging in partisan&#xD;
      gerrymandering is no more than a variant of the argument,&#xD;
      already rejected, that considerations of practical politics&#xD;
      can justify population disparities.' 394 U.S., at 534, 89&#xD;
      S.Ct. 1225.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      Thus, whether or not Connecticut may gerrymander its&#xD;
 legislature if population equality is preserved, it may not do so&#xD;
 when population disparities result.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      An additional consideration urged to justify the&#xD;
 discrepancies is the State's interest in preserving town lines.&#xD;
 But any weight factor this would ordinarily have is rendered&#xD;
 insignificant by the fact that the State's own plan cuts across 47&#xD;
 towns to create assembly districts, and 23 towns to create senate&#xD;
 districts. See Whitcomb v. Chavis, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ydm/whitcomb-v-chavis/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;403&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;124&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 162 n. 42, 91&#xD;
 S.Ct. 1858, 29 L.Ed.2d 363.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      Appellant has one final argument. Attempting to litigate the&#xD;
 merits of the Special Master's plan, he argues that implementation&#xD;
 of that plan would exceed the equity power of the federal court&#xD;
 under our recent decision in Sixty-Seventh Minnesota State Senate&#xD;
 v. Beens, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/ygc/sixty-seventh-minnesota-state-senate-v-beens/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;406&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;187&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 92 S.Ct. 1477, 32 L.Ed.2d 1. But the&#xD;
 merits of the Special Master's plan are not before this Court.&#xD;
 Indeed, in&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p4"&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;p&gt;Page 907&#xD;
 &#xD;
 denying the stay below, the District Court obligated itself to&#xD;
 'set down for hearing with all reasonable dispatch the plan&#xD;
 submitted by the Special Master and any other plans submitted.'&#xD;
 Whatever appellant's objections to the Master's plan might be, he&#xD;
 should first air them in the District Court which stands ready to&#xD;
 hear them.&#xD;
 &#xD;
      Additionally, even were the Special Master's plan at issue,&#xD;
 appellant's objections would not be well taken. This is not a case&#xD;
 in which the size of a state house is 'slashed' in half, as in&#xD;
 &lt;i&gt;Minnesota State Senate, supra&lt;/i&gt;. Here, the District Court merely&#xD;
 reduced the size of Connecticut's house from 151 members to 144,&#xD;
 in order that the number of house district be an even multiple of&#xD;
 the 36 senate districts.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; A house of such size is expressly&#xD;
 contemplated by the Connecticut Constitution.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; The District&#xD;
 Court's action is simply a 'minor variation,' allowing senate and&#xD;
 house districts to be drawn with congruent boundaries, that is&#xD;
 well within the remedial powers of an equity court.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;
 &#xD;
      I dissent from the Court's order granting this stay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;div class="footnotes"&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn1"&gt;&#xD;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;
        &lt;p&gt; The legislature has recently acted to remove whatever&#xD;
 procedural roadblocks there might be to implementation of the&#xD;
 Master's plan or any other which the court below might adopt.&#xD;
 Public Act 220, May 16, 1972. The District Court indicated that&#xD;
 the legislature will shortly submit a plan of its own for the&#xD;
 court's consideration. 341 F.Supp. 139.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn2"&gt;&#xD;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;
        &lt;p&gt; Appellant's Reply Memorandum, at 3. See also appellant's&#xD;
 Motion for Stay of Judgment, at 8.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; It is irrelevant to this comparison that &lt;i&gt;Kirkpatrick&lt;/i&gt;&#xD;
 involved congressional rather than state legislative&#xD;
 redistricting. In either case, the burden is on the State to&#xD;
 demonstrate a valid justification for any population variance, no&#xD;
 matter how small.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn4"&gt;&#xD;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;
        &lt;p&gt; The 'total variance' in an apportionment plan is derived&#xD;
 by adding together the percentage variation from the ideal of the&#xD;
 two districts which are respectively the most over- and&#xD;
 under-populated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn5"&gt;&#xD;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;
        &lt;p&gt; Minor variations for this purpose were approved in the&#xD;
 &lt;i&gt;Minnesota State Senate&lt;/i&gt; case. 406 U.S., at 187, 92 S.Ct. 1477, and&#xD;
 cases cited in n. 10.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Art. III, &amp;#167; 4, of the Connecticut Constitution provides&#xD;
 that 'The house of representatives shall consist of not less than&#xD;
 one hundred twenty-five and not more than two hundred twenty-five&#xD;
 members. . . .'&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;.Appellant also objects to the extent to which the Master's&#xD;
 plan dishonors town boundaries. It is undisputed, however, that&#xD;
 town boundaries cannot be preserved intact in all cases under any&#xD;
 constitutional plan. The Master's plan, drawn with the&#xD;
 preservation of as many town lines as possible as an express&#xD;
 consideration (though a subordinate one to the goal of population&#xD;
 equality), cuts across only 60 towns in creating assembly&#xD;
 districts, and 30 towns in creating senate districts. These&#xD;
 figures compare favorably with those in the State's plan, &lt;i&gt;ante&lt;/i&gt;, at&#xD;
 906.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
      &lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
    </opinion>
