v.&lt;br&gt;
INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;No. 340.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued October 3, 1917.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided November 5, 1917.&lt;/center&gt;
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mr. Edward S. Jouett,&lt;/i&gt; with whom &lt;i&gt;Mr. Helm Bruce&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mr. Henry L. Stone&lt;/i&gt; were on the brief, for appellant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mr. Joseph W. Folk&lt;/i&gt; for the Interstate Commerce Commission, submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE McKENNA delivered the opinion of the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case was submitted with Nos. 337 and 339, &lt;i&gt;ante,&lt;/i&gt; 33 and 47. Like them it is a proceeding to compel appellant to &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*49&lt;/span&gt; answer certain questions asked him by the Interstate Commerce Commission. It was based on a petition like the petitions in those cases to which there was a like reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court entered an order requiring appellant to answer the following questions asked by counsel for the Commission:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I will ask you if you distributed in the State of Alabama on behalf of the Louisville &amp;amp; Nashville Railroad, campaign funds favoring the election of a certain candidate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I show you Ledger H, folio 454, from the records of the Louisville &amp;amp; Nashville Railroad, showing certain vouchers sent you in Alabama for various amounts, and will ask you how you expended the money represented by these vouchers, taking the first voucher as a beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I will ask you whether or not you have personal knowledge of funds of the Louisville &amp;amp; Nashville Railroad and of the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp;amp; St. Louis Railway used to the extent of thousands of dollars for political campaign purposes in the State of Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I will ask you do you know of any campaign funds being expended by the Louisville &amp;amp; Nashville Railroad and the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp;amp; St. Louis Railway in the State of Alabama through any attorney under a subterfuge of paying the attorney a bill for professional services?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Do you know of any funds of the Louisville &amp;amp; Nashville Railroad expended in the State of Alabama for political purposes and charged on the books of the carrier to operating expense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I will ask you if you know of any funds of the Louisville &amp;amp; Nashville Railroad or the Nashville Chattanooga &amp;amp; St. Louis Railway expended in the State of Alabama for political purposes and charged on the books of these carriers or on the books of either carrier to construction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*50&lt;/span&gt; "I will ask you if you have any knowledge of funds of the Louisville &amp;amp; Nashville Railroad or the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp;amp; St. Louis Railway used for political campaign purposes in the State of Tennessee?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Do you know of any funds of the Louisville &amp;amp; Nashville Railroad expended in the State of Tennessee for political campaign purposes and charged on the books of that carrier to operating expense or construction account?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions are similar to those passed on in the other two cases, and the order is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</opinion>
