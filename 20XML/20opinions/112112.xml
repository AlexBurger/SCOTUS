    &lt;p class="parties"&gt;Samuel Loring MORISON&lt;br&gt;v.&lt;br&gt;UNITED STATES.&lt;br&gt;No. A-896.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Samuel Loring Morison was convicted in the District Court of two counts each of espionage, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 793(d), (e), and theft of Government property, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 641.  His conviction was affirmed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca4/3A1W/united-states-v-samuel-loring-morison-the-washingt/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;844&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1057&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1988), and he now asks that he be allowed to remain free on bond pending the consideration of his yet-to-be-filed petition for writ of certiorari.  The statutory standard for determining whether a convicted defendant is entitled to be released pending a certiorari petition is clearly set out in 18 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 3143(b)(1982 ed., Supp. IV), and the only real issue in this application is whether Morison's appeal "raises a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in reversal, an order for a new trial, or a sentence that does not include a term of imprisonment."  I agree with the courts below, however, that regardless of whether Morison has raised a "substantial question" with respect to the propriety of his conviction under the Espionage Act, he has not done so with respect to his conviction for theft of Government property under &amp;#167; 641.  Because Morison has not shown that his appeal is "likely to result in reversal" with respect to all the counts for which imprisonment was imposed, see &lt;i&gt;United&lt;/i&gt; States v. Bayko, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca1/3mrv/united-states-v-mark-allan-bayko/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;774&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;516&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 522 (CA1 1985), his application is denied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
