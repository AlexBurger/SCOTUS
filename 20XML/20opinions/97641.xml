v.&lt;br&gt;
RICHARDSON, TREASURER OF TULSA COUNTY, OKLAHOMA.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;No. 559.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Argued February 23, 1912.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided May 13, 1912.&lt;/center&gt;
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mr. Willard L. Sturdevant,&lt;/i&gt; with whom &lt;i&gt;Mr. Grant Foreman&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mr. M.L. Mott&lt;/i&gt; were on the brief, for plaintiff in error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mr. Charles West,&lt;/i&gt; Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma, for defendants in error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR. JUSTICE LAMAR delivered the opinion of the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiff holds a patent dated December 12, 1902. It was issued to her as a member of the Creek Nation when the tribal lands were divided in pursuance of the same general policy as that discussed in &lt;i&gt;Choate&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Trapp, ante,&lt;/i&gt; p. 665. There were, however, a few differences. The tax exemption covered only the homestead of forty acres, &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*681&lt;/span&gt; and there was a restriction on alienability for 21 years. The patent, instead of being "framed in conformity with the Agreement," as in the case of the Choctaws and Chickasaws, bore on its face a provision that the land should be non-taxable; the language of the Agreement incorporated in the act of Congress, being that "Each citizen shall select from his allotment forty acres of land . . . as a homestead, which shall be and remain non-taxable, inalienable and free from any encumbrance whatever for 21 years from the date of the deed therefor, and a separate deed shall be issued to each allottee for his homestead, in which this condition shall appear."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These differences are not material. The right of plaintiff to the exemption granted by Congress is protected by the Constitution on principles stated and applied in &lt;i&gt;Choate&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Trapp.&lt;/i&gt; The judgment dismissing her complaint is therefore reversed and the case remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with that opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reversed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</opinion>
