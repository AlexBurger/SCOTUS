&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;MCCARTHY&lt;br&gt;
v.&lt;br&gt;
PHILADELPHIA CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;No. 75-783.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supreme Court of United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Decided March 22, 1976.&lt;/center&gt;
ON APPEAL TO THE COMMON WEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA, EASTERN DISTRICT.
&lt;p&gt;PER CURIAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 16 years of service, appellant's employment in the Philadelphia Fire Department was terminated because he moved his permanent residence from Philadelphia to New Jersey in contravention of a municipal regulation requiring employees of the city of Philadelphia to be residents of the city. He challenges the constitutionality of the regulation and the authorizing ordinances&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; as violative of his federally protected right of interstate travel. The regulation was sustained by the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; and review was denied by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; His timely appeal is here pursuant to 28 U. S. C. ยง 1257 (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Michigan Supreme Court held that Detroit's similar &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*646&lt;/span&gt; requirement for police officers was not irrational and did not violate the Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; We dismissed the appeal from that judgment because no substantial federal question was presented. &lt;i&gt;Detroit Police Officers Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;City of Detroit,&lt;/i&gt; 405 U. S. 950 (1972). We have therefore held that this kind of ordinance is not irrational. &lt;i&gt;Hicks&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Miranda,&lt;/i&gt; 422 U. S. 332, 343-345 (1975); see &lt;i&gt;Wardwell&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Board of Education of Cincinnati,&lt;/i&gt; 529 F. 2d 625, 628 (CA6 1976).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have not, however, specifically addressed the contention made by appellant in this case that his constitutionally recognized right to travel interstate as defined in &lt;i&gt;Shapiro&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Thompson,&lt;/i&gt; 394 U. S. 618 (1969); &lt;i&gt;Dunn&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Blumstein,&lt;/i&gt; 405 U. S. 330 (1972); and &lt;i&gt;Memorial Hospital&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Maricopa County,&lt;/i&gt; 415 U. S. 250 (1974), is impaired. Each of those cases involved a statutory requirement of residence in the State for at least one year before becoming eligible either to vote, as in &lt;i&gt;Dunn,&lt;/i&gt; or to receive welfare benefits, as in &lt;i&gt;Shapiro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Memorial Hospital.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; Neither in those cases, nor in any others, have we questioned the validity of a condition placed upon municipal employment that a person be a resident &lt;i&gt;at the time&lt;/i&gt; of his application.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; In this case appellant claims a constitutional right to be employed by the city of Philadelphia &lt;span class="star-pagination"&gt;*647&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;while&lt;/i&gt; he is living elsewhere.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt; There is no support in our cases for such a claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have previously differentiated between a requirement of continuing residency and a requirement of prior residency of a given duration. Thus in &lt;i&gt;Shapiro, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 636, we stated: "The residence requirement and the one-year waiting-period requirement are distinct and independent prerequisites." And in &lt;i&gt;Memorial Hospital, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 255, quoting &lt;i&gt;Dunn, supra,&lt;/i&gt; at 342 n. 13, the Court explained that &lt;i&gt;Shapiro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dunn&lt;/i&gt; did not question " `the validity of appropriately defined and uniformly applied bona fide residence requirements.' "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case involves that kind of bona fide continuing-residence requirement. The judgment of the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania is therefore affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN would note probable jurisdiction and set the case for argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]  ยง 7-401 (u) of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter of 1951; ยง 20-101 of the Philadelphia Code (as amended); and ยง 30.01 of the Philadelphia Civil Service Regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[3]  In an unreported order entered on September 2, 1975, that court denied a petition for review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4]  &lt;i&gt;Detroit Police Officers Assn.&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;City of Detroit,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;385&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Mich.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;519&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 190 N. W. 2d 97 (1971).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5]  Although there is a durational residence requirement in the Philadelphia ordinances, appellant does not have standing to challenge that requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6]  Nor did any of those cases involve a public agency's relationship with its own employees which, of course, may justify greater control than that over the citizenry at large. Cf. &lt;i&gt;Pickering&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Board of Education,&lt;/i&gt; 391 U. S. 563, 568 (1968); &lt;i&gt;CSC&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Letter Carriers,&lt;/i&gt; 413 U. S. 548 (1973); &lt;i&gt;Broadrick&lt;/i&gt; v. &lt;i&gt;Oklahoma,&lt;/i&gt; 413 U. S. 601 (1973).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7]  Appellant seeks review of other alleged errors as if presented in a petition for a writ of certiorari. We decline to review those issues.&lt;/p&gt;
