    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p1"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;We are asked to decide whether the President was acting within his constitutional power when he issued an order directing the Secretary of Commerce to take possession of and operate most of the Nation's steel mills. The mill owners argue that the President's order amounts to lawmaking, a legislative function which the Constitution has expressly confided to the Congress and not to the President. The Government's position is that the order was made on findings of the President that his action was necessary to avert a national catastrophe which would inevitably result from a stoppage of steel production, and that in meeting this grave emergency the President was acting within the aggregate of his constitutional powers as the Nation's Chief Executive and the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States. The issue emerges here from the following series of events:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p2"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In the latter part of 1951, a dispute arose between the steel companies and their employees over terms and conditions that should be included in new collective bargaining agreements. Long-continued conferences failed to resolve the dispute. On December 18, 1951, the employees' representative, United Steelworkers of America, C.I.O., gave notice of an intention to strike when the existing bargaining agreements expired on December 31. The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service then intervened in an effort to get labor and management to agree. This failing, the President on December 22, 1951, referred the dispute to the Federal Wage Stabilization Board&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; to investigate and make recommendations for fair and equitable terms of settlement. This Board's report resulted in no settlement. On April 4, 1952, the Union gave notice of a nation-wide strike called to begin at 12:01 a.m. April 9. The indispensability of steel as a component of substantially all weapons and other war materials led the President to believe that the proposed work stoppage would immediately jeopardize our national defense and that governmental seizure of the steel mills was necessary in order to assure the continued availability of steel. Reciting these considerations for his action, the President, a few hours before the strike was to begin, issued Executive Order 10340, a copy of which is attached as an appendix, post, 72 S.Ct. 868. The order directed the Secretary of Commerce to take possession of most of the steel mills and keep them running. The Secretary immediately issued his own possessory orders, calling upon the presidents of the various seized companies to serve as operationg managers for the United States. They were directed to carry on their activities in accordance with regulations and directions of the Secretary. The next morning the President sent a message to Congress reporting his action. Cong.Rec., April 9, 1952, p. 3962. Twelve days later he sent a second message. Cong.Rec., April 21, 1952, p. 4192. Congress has taken no action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p3"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Obeying the Secretary's orders under protest, the companies brought proceedings against him in the District Court. Their complaints charged that the seizure was not authorized by an act of Congress or by any constitutional provisions. The District Court was asked to declare the orders of the President and the Secretary invalid and to issue preliminary and permanent injunctions restraining their enforcement. Opposing the motion for preliminary injunction, the United States asserted that a strike disrupting steel production for even a brief period would so endanger the well-being and safety of the Nation that the President had 'inherent power' to do what he had done&amp;#8212;power 'supported by the Constitution, by historical precedent, and by court decisions.' The Government also contended that in any event no preliminary injunction should be issued because the companies had made no showing that their available legal remedies were inadequate or that their injuries from seizure would be irreparable. Holding against the Government on all points, the District Court on April 30 issued a preliminary injunction restraining the Secretary from 'continuing the seizure and possession of the plant * * * and from acting under the purported authority of Executive Order No. 10340.' 103 F.Supp. 569. On the same day the Court of Appeals stayed the District Court's injunction. 197 F.2d 582. Deeming it best that the issues raised be promptly decided by this Court, we granted certiorari on May 3 and set the cause for argument on May 12. &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xdQ/the-youngstown-sheet-and-tube-company-et-al/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;343&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;937&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 72 S.Ct. 775.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p4"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Two crucial issues have developed: First. Should final determination of the constitutional validity of the President's order be made in this case which has proceeded no further than the preliminary injunction stage? Second. If so, is the seizure order within the constitutional power of the President?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p5"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It is urged that there were nonconstitutional grounds upon which the District Court could have denied the preliminary injunction and thus have followed the customary judicial practice of declining to reach and decide constitutional questions until compelled to do so. On this basis it is argued that equity's extraordinary injunctive relief should have been denied because (a) seizure of the companies' properties did not inflict irreparable damages, and (b) there were available legal remedies adequate to afford compensation for any possible damages which they might suffer. While separately argued by the Government, these two contentions are here closely related, if not identical. Arguments as to both rest in large part on the Government's claim that should the seizure ultimately be held unlawful, the companies could recover full compensation in the Court of Claims for the unlawful taking. Prior cases in this Court have cast doubt on the right to recover in the Court of Claims on account of properties unlawfully taken by government officials for public use as these properties were alleged to have been. See e.g., Hooe v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/uVA/hooe-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;218&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;322&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 335&amp;#8212;336, 31 S.Ct. 85, 89, 54 L.Ed. 1055; United States v. North American Transportation &amp;amp; Trading Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/vBy/united-states-v-north-american-transp-trading-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;253&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;330&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 333, 40 S.Ct. 518, 519, 64 L.Ed. 935. But see Larson v. Domestic &amp;amp; Foreign Commerce Corp., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/7by7/larson-v-domestic-and-foreign-commerce-corp/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;337&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;682&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 701&amp;#8212;702, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 1467, 93 L.Ed. 1628. Moreover, seizure and governmental operation of these going businesses were bound to result in many present and future damages of such nature as to be difficult, if not incapable, of measurement. Viewing the case this way, and in the light of the facts presented, the District Court saw no reason for delaying decision of the constitutional validity of the orders. We agree with the District Court and can see no reason why that question was not ripe for determination on the record presented. We shall therefore consider and determine that question now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;II.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p6"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The President's power, if any, to issue the order must stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself. There is no statute that expressly authorizes the President to take possession of property as he did here. Nor is there any act of Congress to which our attention has been directed from which such a power can fairly be implied. Indeed, we do not understand the Government to rely on statutory authorization for this seizure. There are two statutes which do authorize the President to take both personal and real property under certain conditions.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; However, the Government admits that these conditions were not met and that the President's order was not rooted in either of the statutes. The Government refers to the seizure provisions of one of these statutes (&amp;#167; 201(b) of the Defense Production Act) as 'much too cumbersome, involved, and time-consuming for the crisis which was at hand.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p7"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Moreover, the use of the seizure technique to solve labor disputes in order to prevent work stoppages was not only unauthorized by any congressional enactment; prior to this controversy, Congress had refused to adopt that method of settling labor disputes. When the Taft-Hartley Act was under consideration in 1947, Congress rejected an amendment which would have authorized such governmental seizures in cases of emergency.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3--6" id="fn3--6_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; Apparently it was thought that the technique of seizure, like that of compulsory arbitration, would interfere with the process of collective bargaining.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; Consequently, the plan Congress adopted in that Act did not provide for seizure under any circumstances. Instead, the plan sought to bring about settlements by use of the customary devices of mediation, conciliation, investigation by boards of inquiry, and public reports. In some instances temporary injunctions were authorized to provide cooling-off periods. All this failing, unions were left free to strike after a secret vote by employees as to whether they wished to accept their employers' final settlement offer.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5--4" id="fn5--4_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p8"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It is clear that if the President had authority to issue the order he did, it must be found in some provisions of the Constitution. And it is not claimed that express constitutional language grants this power to the President. The contention is that presidential power should be implied from the aggregate of his powers under the Constitution. Particular reliance is placed on provisions in Article II which say that 'the executive Power shall be vested in a President * * *'; that 'he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed'; and that he 'shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p9"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The order cannot properly be sustained as an exercise of the President's military power as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. The Government attempts to do so by citing a number of cases upholding broad powers in military commanders engaged in day-to-day fighting in a theater of war. Such cases need not concern us here. Even though 'theater of war' be an expanding concept, we cannot with faithfulness to our constitutional system hold that the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces has the ultimate power as such to take possession of private property in order to keep labor disputes from stopping production. This is a job for the Nation's lawmakers, not for its military authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p10"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Nor can the seizure order be sustained because of the several constitutional provisions that grant executive power to the President. In the framework of our Constitution, the President's power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker. The Constitution limits his functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of laws he tninks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad. And the Constitution is neither silent nor equivocal about who shall make laws which the President is to execute. The first section of the first article says that 'All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States * * *.' After granting many powers to the Congress, Article I goes on to provide that Congress may 'make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p11"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The President's order does not direct that a congressional policy be executed in a manner prescribed by Congress&amp;#8212;it directs that a presidential policy be executed in a manner prescribed by the President. The preamble of the order itself, like that of many statutes, sets out reasons why the President believes certain policies should be adopted, proclaims these policies as rules of conduct to be followed, and again, like a statute, authorizes a government official to promulgate additional rules and regulations consistent with the policy proclaimed and needed to carry that policy into execution. The power of Congress to adopt such public policies as those proclaimed by the order is beyond question. It can authorize the taking of private property for public use. It can makes laws regulating the relationships between employers and employees, prescribing rules designed to settle labor disputes, and fixing wages and working conditions in certain fields of our economy. The Constitution did not subject this law-making power of Congress to presidential or military supervision or control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p12"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It is said that other Presidents without congressional authority have taken possession of private business enterprises in order to settle labor disputes. But even if this be true, Congress has not thereby lost its exclusive constitutional authority to make laws necessary and proper to carry out the powers vested by the Constitution 'in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p13"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Founders of this Nation entrusted the law making power to the Congress alone in both good and bad times. It would do no good to recall the historical events, the fears of power and the hopes for freedom that lay behind their choice. Such a review would but confirm our holding that this seizure order cannot stand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p14"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p15"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Although the considerations relevant to the legal enforcement of the principle of separation of powers seem to me more complicated and flexible than any appear from what Mr. Justice BLACK has written, I join his opinion because I thoroughly agree with the application of the principle to the circumstances of this case. Even though such differences in attitude toward this principle may be merely differences in emphasis and nuance, they can hardly be reflected by a single opinion for the Court. Individual expression of views in reaching a common result is therefore important.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="num" id="p29"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Now, therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p30"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;1. The Secretary of Commerce is hereby authorized and directed to take possession of all or such of the plants, facilities, and other property of the companies named in the list attached hereto (List of specific Steel Companies and Plants omitted), or any part thereof, as he may deem necessary in the interests of national defense; and to operate or to arrange for the operation thereof and to do all things necessary for, or incidental to, such operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p31"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;2. In carrying out this order the Secretary of Commerce may act through or with the aid of such public or private instrumentalities or persons as he may designate; and all Federal agencies shall cooperate with the Secretary of Commerce to the fullest extent possible in carrying out the purposes of this order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p32"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;3. The Secretary of Commerce shall determine and prescribe terms and conditions of employment under which the plants, facilities, and other properties possession of which is taken pursuant to this order shall be operated. The Secretary of Commerce shall recognize the rights of workers to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing and to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining, adjustment of grievances, or other mutual aid or protection, provided that such activities do not interfere with the operation of such plants, facilities, and other properties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p33"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;4. Except so far as the Secretary of Commerce shall otherwise provide from time to time, the managements of the plants, facilities, and other properties possession of which is taken pursuant to this order shall continue their functions, including the collection and disbursement of funds in the usual and ordinary course of business in the names of their respective companies and by means of any instrumentalities used by such companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p34"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;5. Except so far as the Secretary of Commerce may otherwise direct, existing rights and obligations of such companies shall remain in full force and effect, and there may be made, in due course, payments of dividends on stock, and of principal, interest, sinking funds, and all other distributions upon bonds, debentures, and other obligations, and expenditures may be made for other ordinary corporate or business purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="num" id="p35"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;6. Whenever in the judgment of the Secretary of Commerce further possession and operation by him of any plant, facility, or other property is no longer necessary or expedient in the interest of national defense, and the Secretary has reason to believe that effective future operation is assured, he shall return the possession and operation of such plant, facility, or other property to the company in possession and control thereof at the time possession was taken under this order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p36"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;36&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;7. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to prescribe and issue such regulations and orders not inconsistent herewith as he may deem necessary or desirable for carrying out the purposes of this order; and he may delegate and authorize subdelegation of such of his functions under this order as he may been desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="num" id="p40"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Before the cares of the White House were his own, President Harding is reported to have said that government after all is a very simple thing. He must have said that, if he said it, as a fleeting inhabitant of fairyland. The opposite is the truth. A constitutional democracy like ours is perhaps the most difficult of man's social arrangements to manage successfully. Our scheme of society is more dependent than any other form of government on knowledge and wisdom and self-descipline for the achievement of its aims. For our democracy implies the reign of reason on the most extensive scale. The Founders of this Nation were not imbued with the modern cynicism that the only thing that history teaches is that it teaches nothing. They acted on the conviction that the experience of man sheds a good deal of light on his nature. It sheds a good deal of light not merely on the need for effective power, if a society is to be at once cohesive and civilized, but also on the need for limitations on the power of governors over the governed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p41"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;41&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;To that end they rested the structure of our central government on the system of checks and balances. For them the doctrine of separation of powers was not mere theory; it was a felt necessity. Not so long ago it was fashionable to find our system of checks and balances obstructive to effective government. It was easy to ridicule that system as outmoded&amp;#8212;too easy. The experience through which the world has passed in our own day has made vivid the realization that the Framers of our Constitution were not inexperienced doctrinaires. These long-headed statesmen had no illusion that our people enjoyed biological or psychological or sociological immunities from the hazards of concentrated power. It is absurd to see a dictator in a representative product of the sturdy democratic traditions of the Mississippi Valley. The accretion of dangerous power does not come in a day. It does come, however slowly, from the generative force of unchecked disregard of the restrictions that fence in even the most disinterested assertion of authority.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p42"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Framers, however, did not make the judiciary the overseer of our government. They were familiar with the revisory functions entrusted to judges in a few of the States and refused to lodge such powers in this Court. Judicial power can be exercised only as to matters that were the traditional concern of the courts at Westminster, and only if they arise in ways that to the expert feel of lawyers constitute 'Cases' or 'Controversies.' Even as to questions that were the staple of judicial business, it is not for the courts to pass upon them unless they are indispensably involved in a conventional litigation. And then, only to the extent that they are so involved. Rigorous adherence to the narrow scope of the judicial function is especially demanded in controversies that arouse appeals to the Constitution. The attitude with which this Court must approach its duty when confronted with such issues is precisely the opposite of that normally manifested by the general public. So-called constitutional questions seem to exercise a mesmeric influence over the popular mind. This eagerness to settle&amp;#8212;preferably forever a specific problem on the basis of the broadest possible constitutional pronouncements may not unfairly be called one of our minor national traits. An English observer of our scene has acutely described it: 'At the first sound of a new argument over the United States Constitution and its interpretation the hearts of Americans leap with a fearful joy. The blood stirs powerfully in their veins and a new lustre brightens their eyes. Like King Harry's men before Harfleur, they stand like greyhounds in the slips, straining upon the start.' The Economist, May 10, 1952, p. 370.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p43"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;43&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The path of duty for this Court, it bears repetition, lies in the opposite direction. Due regard for the implications of the distribution of powers in our Constitution and for the nature of the judicial process as the ultimate authority in interpreting the Constitution, has not only confined the Court within the narrow domain of appropriate adjudication. It has also led to 'a series of rules under which it has avoided passing upon a large part of all the constitutional questions pressed upon it for decision.' Brandeis, J., in Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wv4/ashwander-v-tva/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;297&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;288&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 341, 346, 56 S.Ct. 466, 480, 482, 80 L.Ed. 688. A basic rule is the duty of the Court not to pass on a constitutional issue at all, however narrowly it may be confined, if the case may, as a matter of intellectual honesty, be decided without even considering delicate problems of power under the Constitution. It ought to be, but apparently is not a matter of common understanding that clashes between different branches of the government should be avoided if a legal ground of less explosive potentialities is properly available. Constitutional adjudications are apt by exposing differences to exacerbate them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p44"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;44&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;So here our first inquiry must be not into the powers of the President, but into the powers of a District Judge to issue a temporary injunction in the circumstances of this case. Familiar as that remedy is, it remains an extraordinary remedy. To start with a consideration of the relation between the President's powers and those of Congress&amp;#8212;a most delicate matter that has occupied the thoughts of statesmen and judges since the Nation was founded and will continue to occupy their thoughts as long as our democracy lasts&amp;#8212;is to start at the wrong end. A plaintiff is not entitled to an injunction if money damages would fairly compensate him for any wrong he may have suffered. The same considerations by which the Steelworkers, in their brief amicus, demonstrate, from the seizure here in controversy, consequences that cannot be translated into dollars and cents, preclude a holding that only compensable damage for the plaintiffs is involved. Again, a court of equity ought not to issue an injunction, even though a plaintiff otherwise makes out a case for it, if the plaintiff's right to an injunction is overborne by a commanding public interest against it. One need not resort to a large epigrammatic generalization that the evils of industrial dislocation are to be preferred to allowing illegality to go unchecked. To deny inquiry into the President's power in a case like this, because of the damage to the public interest to be feared from upsetting its exercise by him, would in effect always preclude inquiry into challenged power, which presumably only avowed great public interest brings into action. And so, with the utmost unwillingness, with every desire to avoid judicial inquiry into the powers and duties of the other two branches of the government, I cannot escape consideration of the legality of Executive Order No. 10340.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p45"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;45&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The pole-star for constitutional adjudications is John Marshall's greatest judicial utterance that 'it is a constitution we are expounding.' McCulloch v. Maryland, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/7LyH/mcculloch-v-maryland/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wheat.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;316&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 407, 4 L.Ed. 579. That requires both a spacious view in applying an instrument of government 'made for an underfined and expanding future,' Hurtado v. People of State of California, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/t4U/hurtado-v-california/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;110&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;516&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 530, 4 S.Ct. 111, 118, 28 L.Ed. 232, and as narrow a delimitation of the constitutional issues as the circumstances permit. Not the least characteristic of great statesmanship which the Framers manifested was the extent to which they did not attempt to bind the future. It is no less incumbent upon this Court to avoid putting fetters upon the future by needless pronouncements today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p46"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;46&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Marshall's admonition that 'it is a constitution we are expounding' is especially relevant when the Court is required to give legal sanctions to an underlying principle of the Constitution&amp;#8212;that of separation of powers. 'The great ordinances of the Constitution do not establish and divide fields of black and white.' Holmes, J., dissenting in Springer v. Government of Philippine Islands, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/w7w/springer-v-philippine-islands/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;277&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;189&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 209, 48 S.Ct. 480, 485, 72 L.Ed. 845.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p47"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;47&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The issue before us can be met, and therefore should be, without attempting to define the President's powers comprehensively. I shall not attempt to delineate what belongs to him by virtue of his office beyond the power even of Congress to contract; what authority belongs to him until Congress acts; what kind of problems may be dealt with either by the Congress or by the President or by both, cf. La Abra Silver Mine Co. v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/uhg/la-abra-silver-mining-co-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;175&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;423&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 20 S.Ct. 168, 44 L.Ed. 223; what power must be exercised by the Congress and cannot be delegated to the President. It is as unprofitable to lump together in an undiscriminating hotch-potch past presidential actions claimed to be derived from occupancy of the office, as it is to conjure up hypothetical future cases. The judiciary may, as this case proves, have to intervene in determining where authority lies as between the democratic forces in our scheme of government. But in doing so we should be wary and humble. Such is the teaching of this Court's role in the history of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p48"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;48&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It is in this mood and with this perspective that the issue before the Court must be approached. We must therefore put to one side consideration of what powers the President would have had if there had been no legislation whatever bearing on the authority asserted by the seizure, or if the seizure had been only for a short, explicitly temporary period, to be terminated automatically unless Congressional approval were given. These and other questions, like or unlike, are not now here. I would exceed my authority were I to say anything about them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p49"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;49&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The question before the Court comes in this setting. Congress has frequently&amp;#8212;at least 16 times since 1916&amp;#8212; specifically provided for executive seizure of production, transportation, communications, or storage facilities. In every case it has qualified this grant of power with limitations and safeguards. This body of enactments&amp;#8212;summarized in tabular form in Appendix I&amp;#8212;demonstrates that Congress deemed seizure so drastic a power as to require that it be carefully circumscribed whenever the President was vested with this extraordinary authority. The power to seize has uniformly been given only for a limited period or for a defined emergency, or has been repealed after a short period. Its exercise has been restricted to particular circumstances such as 'time of war or when was is imminent,' the needs of 'public safety' or of 'national security or defense,' or 'urgent and impending need.' The period of governmental operation has been limited, as, for instance, to 'sixty days after the restoration of productive efficiency.' Seizure statutes usually make executive action dependent on detailed conditions: for example, (a) failure or refusal of the owner of a plant to meet governmental supply needs or (b) failure of voluntary negotiations with the owner for the use of a plant necessary for great public ends. Congress often has specified the particular executive agency which should seize or operate the plants or whose judgment would appropriately test the need for seizure. Congress also has not left to implication that just compensation be paid: it has usually legislated in detail regarding enforcement of this litigation-breeding general requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p50"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Congress in 1947 was again called upon to consider whether governmental seizure should be used to avoid serious industrial shutdowns. Congress decided against conferring such power generally and in advance, without special congressional enactment to meet each particular need. Under the urgency of telephone and coal strikes in the winter of 1946, Congress addressed itself to the problems raised by 'national emergency' strikes and lockouts.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1-1" id="fn1-1_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; The termination of wartime seizure powers on December 31, 1946, brought these matters to the attention of Congress with vivid impact. A proposal that the President be given powers to seize plants to avert a shutdown where the 'health or safety' of the nation was endangered, was thoroughly canvassed by Congress and rejected. No room for doubt remains that the proponents as well as the opponents of the bill which became the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 clearly understood that as a result of that legislation the only recourse for preventing a shutdown in any basic industry, after failure of mediation, was Congress.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2-1" id="fn2-1_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; Authorization for seizure as an available remedy for potential dangers was unequivocally put aside. The Senate Labor Committee, through its Chairman, explicitly reported to the Senate that a general grant of seizure powers had been considered and rejected in favor of reliance on ad hoc legislation, as a particular emergency might call for it.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3--5" id="fn3--5_ref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; An amendment presented in the House providing that where necessary 'to preserve and protect the public health and security' the President might seize any industry in which there is an impending curtailment of production, was voted down after debate, by a vote of more than three to one.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4-1" id="fn4-1_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p51"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;51&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In adopting the provisions which it did, by the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, for dealing with a 'national emergency' arising out of a breakdown in peaceful industrial relations, Congress was very familiar with Government seizure as a protective measure. On a balance of considerations Congress chose not to lodge this power in the President. It chose not to make available in advance a remedy to which both industry and labor were fiercely hostile.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn5--3" id="fn5--3_ref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; In deciding that authority to seize should be given to the President only after full consideration of the particular situation should show such legislation to be necessary, Congress presumably acted on experience with similar industrial conflicts in the past. It evidently assumed that industrial shutdowns in basic industries are not instances of spontaneous generation, and that danger warnings are sufficiently plain before the event to give ample opportunity to start the legislative process into action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p52"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;52&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In any event, nothing can be plainer than that Congress made a conscious choice of policy in a field full of perplexity and peculiarly within legislative responsibility for choice. In formulating legislation for dealing with industrial conflicts, Congress could not more clearly and emphatically have withheld authority than it did in 1947. Perhaps as much so as is true of any piece of modern legislation, Congress acted with full consciousness of what it was doing and in the light of much recent history. Previous seizure legislation had subjected the powers granted to the President to restrictions of varying degrees of stringency. Instead of giving him even limited powers, Congress in 1947 deemed it wise to require the President, upon failure of attempts to reach a voluntary settlement, to report to Congress if he deemed the power of seizure a needed shot for his locker. The President could not ignore the specific limitations of prior seizure statutes. No more could he act in disregard of the limitation put upon seizure by the 1947 Act.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It cannot be contended that the President would have had power to issue this order had Congress explicitly negated such authority in formal legislation. Congress has expressed its will to withhold this power from the President as though it had said so in so many words. The authoritatively expressed purpose of Congress to disallow such power to the President and to require him, when in his mind the occasion arose for such a seizure, to put the matter to Congress and ask for specific authority from it, could not be more decisive if it had been written into &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 206&amp;#8212;210 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. Only the other day we treated the Congressional gloss upon those sections as part of the Act. Amalgamated Ass'n of Street Electric Railway &amp;amp; Motor Coach Employees v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xaL/amalgamated-assn-of-street-electric-railway/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;340&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;383&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 395&amp;#8212; 396, 71 S.CT. 359, 365, 366, 95 L.ED. 364. GRAFTING upon the words a purpOSE of Congress thus unequivocally expressed is the regular legislative mode for defining the scope of an Act of Congress. It would be not merely infelicitous draftsmanship but almost offensive gaucherie to write such a restriction upon the President's power in terms into a statute rather than to have it authoritatively expounded, as it was, by controlling legislative history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p54"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;54&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;By the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, Congress said to the President, 'You may not seize. Please report to us and ask for seizure power if you think it is needed in a specific situation.' This of course calls for a report on the unsuccessful efforts to reach a voluntary settlement, as a basis for discharge by Congress of its responsibility&amp;#8212;which it has unquivocally reserved&amp;#8212;to fashion further remedies than it provided.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn6--8" id="fn6--8_ref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; But it is now claimed that the President has seizure power by virtue of the Defense Production Act of 1950 and its Amendments.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn7--8" id="fn7--8_ref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; And the claim is based on the occurrence of new events&amp;#8212;Korea and the need for stabilization, etc.&amp;#8212;although it was well known that seizure power was withheld by the Act of 1947 and although the President, whose specific requests for other authority were in the main granted by Congress, never suggested that in view of the new events he needed the power of seizure which Congress in its judgment had decided to withhold from him. The utmost that the Korean conflict may imply is that it may have been desirable to have given the President further authority, a freer hand in these matters. Absence of authority in the President to deal with a crisis does not imply want of power in the Government. Conversely the fact that power exists in the Government does not vest it in the President. The need for new legislation does not enact it. Nor does it repeal or amend existing law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p55"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;55&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;No authority that has since been given to the President can by any fair process of statutory construction be deemed to withdraw the restriction or change the will of Congress as expressed by a body of enactments, culminating in the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. Title V of the Defense Production Act, entitled 'Settlement of Labor Disputes,' pronounced the will of Congress 'that there be effective procedures for the settlement of labor disputes affecting national defense,' and that 'primary reliance' be placed 'upon the parties to any labor dispute to make every effort through negotiation and collective bargaining and the full use of mediation and conciliation facilities to effect a settlement in the national interest.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn8--8" id="fn8--8_ref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; Section 502 authorized the President to hold voluntary conferences of labor, industry, and public and government representatives and to 'take such action as may be agreed upon in any such conference and appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title,' provided that no action was taken inconsistent with the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn9--1" id="fn9--1_ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt; This provision&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn10--1" id="fn10--1_ref"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; was said by the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency to contemplate a board similar to the War Labor Board of World War II and 'a national labor-management conference such as was held during World War II, when a no-strike, no-lock-out pledge was obtained.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn11--2" id="fn11--2_ref"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt; Section 502 was believed necessary in addition to existing means for settling disputes voluntarily because the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service could not enter a labor dispute unless requested by one party.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn12" id="fn12_ref"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; Similar explanations of Title V were given in the Conference Report and by Senator Ives, a member of the Senate Committee to whom Chairman Maybank during the debates on the Senate floor referred questions relating to Title V.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn13" id="fn13_ref"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; Senator Ives said:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p56"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;56&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'It should be remembered in this connection that during the      period of the present emergency it is expected that the      Congress will not adjourn, but at most, will recess only for      very limited periods of time. If, therefore, any serious work      stoppage should arise or even be threatened, in spite of the      terms of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, the      Congress would be readily available to pass such legislation      as might be needed to meet the difficulty.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn14" id="fn14_ref"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p57"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;57&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Defense Production Act affords no ground for the suggestion that the 1947 denial to the President of seizure powers has been impliedly repealed, and its legislative history contradicts such a suggestion. Although the proponents of that Act recognized that the President would have a choice of alternative methods of seeking a mediated settlement, they also recognized that Congress alone retained the ultimate coercive power to meet the threat of 'any serious work stoppage.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p58"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;58&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;That conclusion is not changed by what occurred after the passage of the 1950 Act. Seven and a half months later, on April 21, 1951, the President by Executive Order 10233 gave the reconstituted Wage Stabilization Board authority to investigate labor disputes either (1) submitted voluntarily by the parties, or (2) referred to it by the President.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn15" id="fn15_ref"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt; The Board can make only 'recommendations to the parties as to fair and equitable terms of settlement' unless the parties agree to be bound by the Board's recommendation. About a month thereafter Sub-Committees of both the House and Senate Labor Committees began hearings on the newly assigned disputes functions of the Board.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn16" id="fn16_ref"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt; Amendments to deny the Board these functions were voted down in the House,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn17" id="fn17_ref"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt; and Congress extended the Defense Production Act without changing Title V in relevant part.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn18" id="fn18_ref"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt; The legislative history of the Defense Production Act and its Amendments in 1951 cannot possibly be vouched for more than Congressional awareness and tacit approval that the President had charged the Wage Stabilization Board with authority to seek voluntary settlement of labor disputes. The most favorable interpretation of the statements in the committee reports can make them mean no more than 'We are glad to have all the machinery possible for the voluntary settlement of labor disputes.' In considering the Defense Production Act Amendments, Congress was never asked to approve&amp;#8212;and there is not the slightest indication that the responsible committees ever had in mind seizure of plants to coerce settlement of disputes. We are not even confronted by an inconsistency between the authority conferred on the Wage Board, as formulated by the Executive Order, and the denial of Presidential seizure powers under the 1947 legislation. The Board has been given merely mediatory powers similar to those of agencies created by the Taft-Hartley Act and elsewhere, with no other sanctions for acceptance of its recommendations than are offered by its own moral authority and the pressure of public opinion. The Defense Production Act and the disputes-mediating agencies created subsequent to it still leave for solution elsewhere the question what action can be taken when attempts at voluntary settlement fail. To draw implied approval of seizure power from this history is to make something out of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p59"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;59&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It is one thing to draw an intention of Congress from general language and to say that Congress would have explicitly written what is inferred, where Congress has not addressed itself to a specific situation. It is quite impossible, however, when Congress did specifically address itself to a problem, as Congress did to that of seizure, to find secreted in the interstices of legislation the very grant of power which Congress consciously withheld. To find authority so explicitly withheld is not merely to disregard in a particular instance the clear will of Congress. It is to disrespect the whole legislative process and the constitutional division of authority between President and Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p60"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The legislative history here canvassed is relevant to yet another of the issues before us, namely, the Government's argument that overriding public interest prevents the issuance of the injunction despite the illegality of the seizure. I cannot accept that contention. 'Balancing the equities' when considering whether an injunction should issue, is lawyers' jargon for choosing between conflicting public interests. When Congress itself has struck the balance, has defined the weight to be given the competing interests, a court of equity is not justified in ignoring that pronouncement under the guise of exercising equitable discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p61"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;61&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Apart from his vast share of responsibility for the conduct of our foreign relations, the embracing function of the President is that 'he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed * * *.' Art. II, &amp;#167; 3. The nature of that authority has for me been comprehensively indicated by Mr. Justice Holmes. 'The duty of the President to see that the laws be executed is a duty that does not go beyond the laws or require him to achieve more than Congress sees fit to leave within his power.' Myers v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/w17/myers-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;272&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;52&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 177, 47 S.Ct. 21, 85, 71 L.Ed. 160. The powers of the President are not as particularized as are those of Congress. But unenumerated powers do not mean undefined powers. The separation of powers built into our Constitution gives essential content to undefined provisions in the frame of our government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p62"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;62&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;To be sure, the content of the three authorities of government is not to be derived from an abstract analysis. The areas are partly interacting, not wholly disjointed. The Constitution is a framework for government. Therefore the way the framework has consistently operated fairly establishes that it has operated according to its true nature. Deeply embedded traditional ways of conducting government cannot supplant the Constitution or legislation, but they give meaning to the words of a text or supply them. It is an inadmissibly narrow conception of American constitutional law to confine it to the words of the Constitution and to disregard the gloss which life has written upon them. In short, a systematic, unbroken, executive practice, long pursued to the knowledge of the Congress and never before questioned, engaged in by Presidents who have also sworn to uphold the Constitution, making as it were such exercise of power part of the structure of our government, may be treated as a gloss on 'executive Power' vested in the President by &amp;#167; 1 of Art. II.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p63"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;63&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Such was the case of United States v. Midwest Oil Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/vff/united-states-v-midwest-oil-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;236&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;459&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 35 S.Ct. 309, 59 L.Ed. 673. The contrast between the circumstances of that case and this one helps to draw a clear line between authority not explicitly conferred yet authorized to be exercised by the President and the denial of such authority. In both instances it was the concern of Congress under express constitutional grant to make rules and regulations for the problems with which the President dealt. In the one case he was dealing with the protection of property belonging to the United States; in the other with the enforcement of the Commerce Clause and with raising and supporting armies and maintaining the Navy. In the Midwest Oil case lands which Congress had opened for entry were, over a period of 80 years and in 252 instances, and by Presidents learned and unlearned in the law, temporarily withdrawn from entry so as to enable Congress to deal with such withdrawals. No remotely comparable practice can be vouched for executive seizure of property at a time when this country was not at war, in the only constitutional way in which it can be at war. It would pursue the irrelevant to reopen the controversy over the constitutionality of some acts of Lincoln during the Civil War. See J. G. Randall, Constitutional Problems under Lincoln (Revised ed. 1951). Suffice it to say that he seized railroads in territory where armed hostilities had already interrupted the movement of troops to the beleaguered Capitol, and his order was ratified by the Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p64"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The only other instances of seizures are those during the periods of the first and second World Wars.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn19" id="fn19_ref"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt; In his eleven seizures of industrial facilities, President Wilson acted, or at least purported to act,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn20" id="fn20_ref"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; under authority granted by Congress. Thus his seizures cannot be adduced as interpretations by a President of his own powers in the absence of statute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p65"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;65&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Down to the World War II period, then, the record is barren of instances comparable to the one before us. Of twelve seizures by President Roosevelt prior to the enactment of the War Labor Disputes Act in June, 1943, three were sanctioned by existing law, and six others were effected after Congress, on December 8, 1941, had declared the existence of a state of war. In this case, reliance on the powers that flow from declared war has been commendably disclaimed by the Solicitor General. Thus the list of executive assertions of the power of seizure in circumstances comparable to the present reduces to three in the six-month period from June to December of 1941. We need not split hairs in comparing those actions to the one before us, though much might be said by way of differentiation. Without passing on their validity, as we are not called upon to do, it suffices to say that these three isolated instances do not add up, either in number, scope, duration or contemporaneous legal justification, to the kind of executive construction of the Constitution revealed in the Midwest Oil case. Nor do they come to us sanctioned by long-continued acquiescence of Congress giving decisive weight to a construction by the Executive of its powers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p66"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;66&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;A scheme of government like ours no doubt at times feels the lack of power to act with complete, all-embracing, swiftly moving authority. No doubt a government with distributed authority, subject to be challenged in the courts of law, at least long enough to consider and adjudicate the challenge, labors under restrictions from which other governments are free. It has not been our tradition to envy such governments. In any event our government was designed to have such restrictions. The price was deemed not too high in view of the safeguards which these restrictions afford. I know no more impressive words on this subject than those of Mr. Justice Brandeis:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'The doctrine of the separation of powers was adopted by the      Convention of 1787, not to promote efficiency but to preclude      the exercise of arbitrary power.

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It is not a pleasant judicial duty to find that the President has exceeded his powers and still less so when his purposes were dictated by concern for the Nation's wellbeing, in the assured conviction that he acted to avert danger. But it would stultify one's faith in our people to entertain even a momentary fear that the patriotism and the wisdom of the President and the Congress, as well as the long view of the immediate parties in interest, will not find ready accommodation for differences on matters which, however close to their concern and however intrinsically important, are overshadowed by the awesome issues which confront the world. When at a moment of utmost anxiety President Washington turned to this Court for advice, and he had to be denied it as beyond the Court's competence to give, Chief Justice Jay, on behalf of the Court, wrote thus to the Father of his Country:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;325&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;There can be no doubt that the emergency which caused the President to seize these steel plants was one that bore heavily on the country. But the emergency did not create power; it merely marked an occasion when power should be exercised. And the fact that it was necessary that measures be taken to keep steel in production does not mean that the President, rather than the Congress, had the constitutional authority to act. The Congress, as well as the President, is trustee of the national welfare. The President can act more quickly than the Congress. The President with the armed services at his disposal can move with force as well as with speed. All executive power&amp;#8212;from the reign of ancient kings to the rule of modern dictators&amp;#8212;has the outward appearance of efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p326"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;326&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Legislative power, by contrast, is slower to exercise. There must be delay while the ponderous machinery of committees, hearings, and debates is put into motion. That takes time; and while the Congress slowly moves into action, the emergency may take its toll in wages, consumer goods, war production, the standard of living of the people, and perhaps even lives. Legislative action may indeed often be cumbersome, time-consuming, and apparently inefficient. But as Mr. Justice Brandeis stated in his dissent in Myers v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/w17/myers-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;272&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;52&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 293, 47 S.Ct. 21, 85, 71 L.Ed. 160:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p327"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;327&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'The doctrine of the separation of powers was adopted by the      Convention of 1787 not to promote efficiency but to preclude      the exercise of arbitrary power. The purpose was not to avoid      friction, but, by means of the inevitable friction incident      to the distribution of the governmental powers among three      departments, to save the people from autocracy.' We therefore cannot decide this case by determining which branch of government can deal most expeditiously with the present crisis. The answer must depend on the allocation of powers under the Constitution. That in turn requires an analysis of the conditions giving rise to the seizure and of the seizure itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p328"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;328&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The relations between labor and industry are one of the crucial problems of the era. Their solution will doubtless entail many methods&amp;#8212;education of labor leaders and business executives; the encouragement of mediation and conciliation by the President and the use of his great office in the cause of industrial peace; and the passage of laws. Laws entail sanctions&amp;#8212;penalties for their violation. One type of sanction is find and imprisonment. Another is seizure of property. An industry may become so lawless, so irresponsible as to endanger the whole economy. Seizure of the industry may be the only wise and practical solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p329"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;329&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The method by which industrial peace is achieved is of vital importance not only to the parties but to society as well. A determination that sanctions should be applied, that the hand of the law should be placed upon the parties, and that the force of the courts should be directed against them, is an exercise of legislative power. In some nations that power is entrusted to the executive branch as a matter of course or in case of emergencies. We chose another course. We chose to place the legislative power of the Federal Government in the Congress. The language of the Constitution is not ambiguous or qualified. It places not some legislative power in the Congress; Article I, Section 1 says 'All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p330"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;330&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The legislative nature of the action taken by the President seems to me to be clear. When the United States takes over an industrial plant to settle a labor controversy, it is condemning property. The seizure of the plant is a taking in the constitutional sense. United States v. Pewee Coal Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xbv/united-states-v-pewee-coal-co-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;341&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;114&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 71 S.Ct. 670, 95 L.Ed. 809. A permanent taking would amount to the nationalization of the industry. A temporary taking falls short of that goal. But though the seizure is only for a week or a month, the condemnation is complete and the United States must pay compensation for the temporary possession. United States v. General Motors Corp., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wW3/united-states-v-general-motors-corp/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;323&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;373&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 65 S.Ct. 357, 89 L.Ed. 311; United States v. Pewee Coal Co., supra.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p331"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;331&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The power of the Federal Government to condemn property is well established. Kohl v. United States, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/svL/kohl-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;91&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;367&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 23 L.Ed. 449. It can condemn for any public purpose; and I have no doubt but that condemnation of a plant, factory, or industry in order to promote industrial peace would be constitutional. But there is a duty to pay for all property taken by the Government. The command of the Fifth Amendment is that no 'private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. That constitutional requirement has an important bearing on the present case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p332"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;332&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The President has no power to raise reveunes. That power is in the Congress by Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. The President might seize and the Congress by subsequent action might ratify the seizure.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1-3" id="fn1-3_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; But until and unless Congress acted, no condemnation would be lawful. The branch of government that has the power to pay compensation for a seizure is the only one able to authorize a seizure or make lawful one that the President had effected.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2-3" id="fn2-3_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; That seems to me to be the necessary result of the condemnation provision in the Fifth Amendment. It squares with the theory of checks and balances expounded by Mr. Justice BLACK in the opinion of the Court in which I Join.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p333"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;333&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;If we sanctioned the present exercise of power by the President, we would be expanding Article II of the Constitution and rewriting it to suit the political conveniences of the present emergency. Article II which vests the 'executive Power' in the President defines that power with particularity. Article II, Section 2 makes the Chief Executive the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy. But our history and tradition rebel at the thought that the grant of military power carries with it authority over civilian affairs. Article II, Section 3 provides that the President shall 'from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.' The power to recommend legislation, granted to the President, serves only to emphasize that it is his function to recommend and that it is the function of the Congress to legislate. Article II, Section 3, also provides that the President 'shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.' But as Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER point out the power to execute the laws starts and ends with the laws Congress has enacted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p334"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;334&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The great office of President is not a weak and powerless one. The President represents the people and is their spokesman in domestic and foreign affairs. The office is respected more than any other in the land. It gives a position of leadership that is unique. The power to formulate policies and mould opinion inheres in the Presidency and conditions our national life. The impact of the man and the philosophy he represents may at times be thwarted by the Congress. Stalemates may occur when emergencies mount and the Nation suffers for lack of harmonious, reciprocal action between the White House and Capitol Hill. That is a risk inherent in our system of separation of powers. The tragedy of such stalemates might be avoided by allowing the President the use of some legislative authority. The Framers with memories of the tyrannies produced by a blending of executive and legislative power rejected that political arrangement. Some future generation may, however, deem it so urgent that the President have legislative authority that the Constitution will be amended. We could not sanction the seizures and condemnations of the steel plants in this case without reading Article II as giving the President not only the power to execute the laws but to make some. Such a step would most assuredly alter the pattern of the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p335"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;335&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;We pay a price for our system of checks and balances, for the distribution of power among the three branches of government. It is a price that today may seem exorbitant to many. Today a kindly President uses the seizure power to effect a wage increase and to keep the steel furnaces in production. Yet tomorrow another President might use the same power to prevent a wage increase, to curb trade unionists, to regiment labor as oppressively as industry thinks it has been regimented by this seizure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p336"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;336&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Justice JACKSON, concurring in the judgment and opinion of the cuort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p337"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;337&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;That comprehensive and undefined presidential powers hold both practical advantages and grave dangers for the country will impress anyone who has served as legal adviser to a President in time of transition and public anxiety. While an interval of detached reflection may temper teachings of that experience, they probably are a more realistic influence on my views than the conventional materials of judicial decision which seem unduly to accentuate doctrine and legal fiction. But as we approach the question of presidential power, we half overcome mental hazards by recognizing them. The opinions of judges, no less than executives and publicists, often suffer the infirmity of confusing the issue of a power's validity with the cause it is invoked to promote, of confounding the permanent executive office with its temporary occupant. The tendency is strong to emphasize transient results upon policies&amp;#8212;such as wages or stabilization&amp;#8212;and lose sight of enduring consequences upon the balanced power structure of our Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p338"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;338&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;A judge, like an executive adviser, may be surprised at the poverty of really useful and unambiguous authority applicable to concrete problems of executive power as they actually present themselves. Just what our forefathers did envision, or would have envisioned had they foreseen modern conditions, must be divined from materials almost as enigmatic as the dreams Joseph was called upon to interpret for Pharaoh. A century and a half of partisan debate and scholarly speculation yields no net result but only supplies more or less apt quotations from respected sources on each side of any question. They largely cancel each other.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1-4" id="fn1-4_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; And court decisions are indecisive because of the judicial practice of dealing with the largest questions in the most narrow way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p339"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;339&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The actual art of governing under our Constitution does not and cannot conform to judicial definitions of the power of any of its branches based on isolated clauses or even single Articles torn from context. While the Constitution diffuses power the better to secure liberty, it also contemplates that practice will integrate the dispersed powers into a workable government. It enjoins upon its branches separateness but interdependence, autonomy but reciprocity. Presidential powers are not fixed but fluctuate, depending upon their disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress. We may well begin by a somewhat over-simplified grouping of practical situations in which a President may doubt, or others may challenge, his powers, and by distinguishing roughly the legal consequences of this factor of relativity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p340"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;340&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;1. When the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2-4" id="fn2-4_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; In these circumstances, and in these only, may he be said (for what it may be worth), to personify the federal sovereignty. If his act is held unconstitutional under these circumstances, it usually means that the Federal Government as an undivided whole lacks power. A seizure executed by the President pursuant to an Act of Congress would be supported by the strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation, and the burden of persuasion would rest heavily upon any who might attack it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p341"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;341&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;2. When the President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain. Therefore, congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence may sometimes, at least as a practical matter, enable, if not invite, measures on independent presidential responsibility. In this area, any actual test of power is likely to depend on the imperatives of events and contemporary imponderables rather than on abstract theories of law.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p342"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;342&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;3. When the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter. Courts can sustain exclusive Presidential control in such a case only be disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4-4" id="fn4-4_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; Presidential claim to a power at once so conclusive and preclusive must be scrutinized with caution, for what is at stake is the equilibruim established by our constitutional system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p343"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;343&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Into which of these classifications does this executive seizure of the steel industry fit? It is eliminated from the first by admission, for it is conceded that no congressional authorization exists for this seizure. That takes away also the support of the many precedents and declarations which were made in relation, and must be confined, to this category.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p344"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;344&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Can it then be defended under flexible tests available to the second category? It seems clearly eliminated from that class because Congress has not left seizure of private property an open field but has covered it by three statutory policies inconsistent with this seizure. In cases where the purpose is to supply needs of the Government itself, two courses are provided: one, seizure of a plant which fails to comply with obligatory orders placed by the Government,&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; another, condemnation of facilities, including temporary use under the power of eminent domain.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; The third is applicable where it is the general economy of the country that is to be protected rather than exclusive governmental interests.&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; None of these were invoked. In choosing a different and inconsistent way of his own, the President cannot claim that it is necessitated or invited by failure of Congress to legislate upon the occasions, grounds and methods for seizure of industrial properties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p345"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;345&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This leaves the current seizure to be justified only by the severe tests under the third grouping, where it can be supported only by any remainder of executive power after subtraction of such powers as Congress may have over the subject. In short, we can sustain the President only by holding that seizure of such strike-bound industries is within his domain and beyond control by Congress. Thus, this Court's first review of such seizures occurs under circumstances which leave Presidential power most vulnerable to attack and in the least favorable of possible constitutional postures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p346"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;346&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;I did not suppose, and I am not persuaded, that history leaves it open to question, at least in the courts, that the executive branch, like the Federal Government as a whole, possesses only delegated powers. The purpose of the Constitution was not only to grant power, but to keep it from getting out of hand. However, because the President does not enjoy unmentioned powers does not mean that the mentioned ones should be narrowed by a niggardly construction. Some clauses could be made almost unworkable, as well as immutable, by refusal to indulge some latitude of interpretation for changing times. I have heretofore, and do now, give to the enumerated powers the scope and elasticity afforded by what seem to be reasonable practical implications instead of the rigidity dictated by a doctrinaire textualism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p347"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;347&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Solicitor General seeks the power of seizure in three clauses of the Executive Article, the first reading, 'The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.' Lest I be thought to exaggerate, I quote the interpretation which his brief puts upon it: 'In our view, this clause constitutes a grant of all the executive powers of which the Government is capable.' If that be true, it is difficult to see why the forefathers bothered to add several specific items, including some trifling ones.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn9-1" id="fn9-1_ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p348"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;348&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The example of such unlimited executive power that must have most impressed the forefathers was the prerogative exercised by George III, and the description of its evils in the Declaration of Independence leads me to doubt that they were creating their new Executive in his image. Continental European examples were no more appealing. And if we seek instruction from our own times, we can match it only from the executive powers in those governments we disparagingly describe as totalitarian. I cannot accept the view that this clause is a grant in bulk of all conceivable executive power but regard it as an allocation to the presidential office of the generic powers thereafter stated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p349"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;349&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The clause on which the Government next relies is that 'The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States * * *.' These cryptic words have given rise to some of the most persistent controversies in our constitutional history. Of course, they imply something more than an empty title. But just what authority goes with the name has plagued Presidential advisers who would not waive or narrow it by nonassertion yet cannot say where it begins or ends. It undoubtedly puts the Nation's armed forces under Presidential command. Hence, this loose appellation is sometimes advanced as support for any Presidential action, internal or external, involving use of force, the idea being that it vests power to do anything, anywhere, that can be done with an army or navy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p350"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;350&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;That seems to be the logic of an argument tendered at our bar that the President having, on his own responsibility, sent American troops abroad derives from that act 'affirmative power' to seize the means of producing a supply of steel for them. To quote, 'Perhaps the most forceful illustrations of the scope of Presidential power in this connection is the fact that American troops in Korea, whose safety and effectiveness are so directly involved here, were sent to the field by an exercise of the President's constitutional powers.' Thus, it is said he has invested himself with 'war powers.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p351"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;351&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;I cannot foresee all that it might entail if the Court should indorse this argument. Nothing in our Constitution is plainer than that declaration of a war is entrusted only to Congress. Of course, a state of war may in fact exist without a formal declaration. But no doctrine that the Court could promulgate would seem to me more sinister and alarming than that a President whose conduct of foreign affairs is so largely uncontrolled, and often even is unknown, can vastly enlarge his mastery over the internal affairs of the country by his own commitment of the Nation's armed forces to some foreign venture.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn10-1" id="fn10-1_ref"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; I do not, however, find it necessary or appropriate to consider the legal status of the Korean enterprise to discountenance argument based on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p352"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;352&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Assuming that we are in a war de facto, whether it is or is not a war de jure, does that empower the Commander-in-Chief to seize industries he thinks necessary to supply our army? The Constitution expressly places in Congress power 'to raise and support Armies' and 'to provide and maintain a Navy.' (Emphasis supplied.) This certainly lays upon Congress primary responsibility for supplying the armed forces. Congress alone controls the raising of revenues and their appropriation and may determine in what manner and by what means they shall be spent for military and naval procurement. I suppose no one would doubt that Congress can take over war supply as a Government enterprise. On the other hand, if Congress sess fit to rely on free private enterprise collectively bargaining with free labor for support and maintenance of our armed forces can the Executive because of lawful disagreements incidental to that process, seize the facility for operation upon Government-imposed terms?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p353"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;353&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;There are indications that the Constitution did not contemplate that the title Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy will constitute him also Commander-in-Chief of the country, its industries and its inhabitants. He has no monopoly of 'war powers,' whatever they are. While Congress cannot deprive the President of the command of the army and navy, only Congress can provide him an army or navy to command. It is also empowered to make rules for the 'Government and Regulation of land and naval forces,' by which it may to some unknown extent impinge upon even command functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p354"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;354&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;That military powers of the Commander-in-Chief were not to supersede representative government of internal affairs seems obvious from the Constitution and from elementary American history. Time out of mind, and even now in many parts of the world, a military commander can seize private housing to shelter his troops. Not so, however, in the United States, for the Third Amendment says, 'No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.' Thus, even in war time, his seizure of needed military housing must be authorized by Congress. It also was expressly left to Congress to 'provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions * * *.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn11-1" id="fn11-1_ref"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt; Such a limitation on the command power, written at a time when the militia rather than a standing army was contemplated as the military weapon of the Republic, underscores the Constitution's policy that Congress, not the Executive, should control utilization of the war power as an instrument of domestic policy. Congress, fulfilling that function, has authorized the President to use the army to enforce certain civil rights.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn12-1" id="fn12-1_ref"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; On the other hand, Congress has forbidden him to use the army for the purpose of executing general laws except when expressly authorized by the Constitution or by Act of Congress.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn13-1" id="fn13-1_ref"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p355"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;355&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;While broad claims under this rubric often have been made, advice to the President in specific matters usually has carried overtones that powers, even under this head, are measured by the command functions usual to the topmost officer of the army and navy. Even then, heed has been taken of any efforts of Congress to negative his authority.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn14-1" id="fn14-1_ref"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p356"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;356&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;We should not use this occasion to circumscribe, much less to contract, the lawful role of the President as Commander-in-Chief. I should indulge the widest latitude of interpretation to sustain his exclusive function to command the instruments of national force, at least when turned against the outside world for the security of our society. But, when it is turned inward, not because of rebellion but because of a lawful economic struggle between industry and labor, it should have no such indulgence. His command power is not such an absolute as might be implied from that office in a militaristic system but is subject to limitations consistent with a constitutional Republic whose law and policy-making breanch is a representative Congress. The purpose of lodging dual titles in one man was to insure that the civilian would control the military, not to enable the military to subordinate the presidential office. No penance would ever expiate the sin against free government of holding that a President can escape control of executive powers by law through assuming his military role. What the power of command may include I do not try to envision, but I think it is not a military prerogative, without support of law, to seize persons or property because they are important or even essential for the military and naval establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p357"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;357&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The third clause in which the Solicitor General finds seizure powers is that 'he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed * * *.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn15-1" id="fn15-1_ref"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt; That authority must be matched against words of the Fifth Amendment that 'No person shall be * * * deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law * * *.' One gives a governmental authority that reaches so far as there is law, the other gives a private right that authority shall go no farther. These signify about all there is of the principle that ours is a government of laws, not of men, and that we submit ourselves to rulers only if under rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p358"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;358&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Solicitor General lastly grounds support of the seizure upon nebulous, inherent powers never expressly granted but said to have accrued to the office from the customs and claims of preceding administrations. The plea is for a resulting power to deal with a crisis or an emergency according to the necessities of the case, the unarticulated assumption being that necessity knows no law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p359"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;359&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Loose and irresponsible use of adjectives colors all non-legal and much legal discussion of presidential powers. 'Inherent' powers, 'implied' powers, 'incidental' powers, 'plenary' powers, 'war' powers and 'emergency' powers are used, often interchangeably and without fixed or ascertainable meanings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p360"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;360&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The vagueness and generality of the clauses that set forth presidential powers afford a plausible basis for pressures within and without an administration for presidential action beyond that supported by those whose responsibility it is to defend his actions in court. The claim of inherent and unrestricted presidential powers has long been a persuasive dialectical weapon in political controversy. While it is not surprising that counsel should grasp support from such unadjudicated claims of power, a judge cannot accept self-serving press statements of the attorney for one of the interested parties as authority in answering a constitutional question, even if the advocate was himself. But prudence has counseled that actual reliance on such nebulous claims stop short of provoking a judicial test.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn16-1" id="fn16-1_ref"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p361"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;361&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Solicitor General, acknowledging that Congress has never authorized the seizure here, says practice of prior Presidents has authorized it. He seeks color of legality from claimed executive precedents, chief of which is President Roosevelt's seizure of June 9, 1941, of the California plant of the North American Aviation Company. Its superficial similarities with the present case, upon analysis, yield to distinctions so decisive that it cannot be regarded as even a precedent, much less an authority for the present seizure.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn17-1" id="fn17-1_ref"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p362"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;362&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The appeal, however, that we declare the existence of inherent powers ex necessitate to meet an emergency asks us to do what many think would be wise, although it is something the forefathers omitted. They knew what emergencies were, knew the pressures they engender for authoritative action, knew, too, how they afford a ready pretext for usurpation. We may also suspect that they suspected that emergency powers would tend to kindle emergencies. Aside from suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in time of rebellion or invasion, when the public safety may require it,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn18-1" id="fn18-1_ref"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt; they made no express provision for exercise of extraordinary authority because of a crisis.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn19-1" id="fn19-1_ref"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt; I do not think we rightfully may so amend their work, and, if we could, I am not convinced it would be wise to do so, although many modern nations have forthrightly recognized that war and economic crises may upset the normal balance between liberty and authority. Their experience with emergency powers may not be irrelevant to the argument here that we should say that the Executive, of his own volition, can invest himself with undefined emergency powers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p363"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;363&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Germany, after the First World War, framed the Weimar Constitution, designed to secure her liberties in the Western tradition. However, the President of the Republic, without concurrence of the Reichstag, was empowered temporarily to suspend any or all individual rights if public safety and order were seriously distrubed or endangered. This proved a temptation to every government, whatever its shade of opinion, and in 13 years suspension of rights was invoked on more than 250 occasions. Finally, Hitler persuaded President Von Hindenberg to suspend all such rights, and they were never restored.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn20-1" id="fn20-1_ref"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p364"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;364&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The French Republic provided for a very different kind of emergency government known as the 'state of siege.' It differed from the German emergency dictatorship, particularly in that emergency powers could not be assumed at will by the Executive but could only be granted as a parliamentary measure. And it did not, as in Germany, result in a suspension or abrogation of law but was a legal institution governed by special legal rules and terminable by parliamentary authority.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn21" id="fn21_ref"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p365"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;365&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Great Britain also has fought both World Wars under a sort of temporary dictatorship created by legislation.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn22" id="fn22_ref"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt; As Parliament is not bound by written constitutional limitations, it established a crisis government simply by delegation to its Ministers of a larger measure than usual of its own unlimited power, which is exercised under its supervision by Ministers whom it may dismiss. This has been called the 'highwater mark in the voluntary surrender of liberty,' but, as Churchill put it, 'Parliament stands custodian of these surrendered liberties, and its most sacred duty will be to restore them in their fullness when victory has crowned our exertions and our perseverance.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn23" id="fn23_ref"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt; Thus, parliamentary control made emergency powers compatible with freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p366"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;366&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This contemporary foreign experience may be inconclusive as to the wisdom of lodging emergency powers somewhere in a modern government. But it suggests that emergency powers are consistent with free government only when their control is lodged elsewhere than in the Executive who exercises them. That is the safeguard that would be nullified by our adoption of the 'inherent powers' formula. Nothing in my experience convinces me that such risks are warranted by any real necessity, although such powers would, of course, be an executive convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p367"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;367&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In the practical working of our Government we already have evolved a technique within the framework of the Constitution by which normal executive powers may be considerably expanded to meet an emergency. Congress may and has granted extraordinary authorities which lie dormant in normal times but may be called into play by the Executive in war or upon proclamation of a national emergency. In 1939, upon congressional request, the Attorney General listed ninety-nine such separate statutory grants by Congress of emergency or war-time executive powers.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn24" id="fn24_ref"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt; They were invoked from time to time as need appeared. Under this procedure we retain Government by law&amp;#8212;special, temporary law, perhaps, but law nonetheless. The public may know the extent and limitations of the powers that can be asserted, and persons affected may be informed from the statute of their rights and duties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p368"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;368&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In view of the ease, expedition and safety with which Congress can grant and has granted large emergency powers, certainly ample to embrace this crisis, I am quite unimpressed with the argument that we should affirm possession of them without statute. Such power either has no beginning or it has no end. If it exists, it need submit to no legal restraint. I am not alarmed that it would plunge us straightway into dictatorship, but it is at least a step in that wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p369"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;369&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;As to whether there is imperative necessity for such powers, it is relevant to note the gap that exists between the President's paper powers and his real powers. The Constitution does not disclose the measure of the actual controls wielded by the modern presidential office. That instrument must be understood as an Eighteenth-Century sketch of a government hoped for, not as a blueprint of the Government that is. Vast accretions of federal power, eroded from that reserved by the States, have magnified the scope of presidential activity. Subtle shifts take place in the centers of real power that do not show on the face of the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p370"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;370&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Executive power has the advantage of concentration in a single head in those choice the whole Nation has a part, making him the focus of public hopes and expectations. In drama, magnitude and finality his decisions so far overshadow any others that almost alone he fills the public eye and ear. No othe personality in public life can begin to compete with him in access to the public mind through modern methods of communications. By his prestige as head of state and his influence upon public opinion he exerts a leverage upon those who are supposed to check and balance his power which often cancels their effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p371"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;371&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Moreover, rise of the party system has made a significant extraconstitutional supplement to real executive power. No appraisal of his necessities is realistic which overlooks that he heads a political system as well as a legal system. Party loyalties and interests, sometimes more binding than law, extend his effective control into branches of government other than his own and he often may win, as a political leader, what he cannot command under the Constitution. Indeed, Woodrow Wilson, commenting on the President as leader both of his party and of the Nation, observed, 'If he rightly interpret the national thought and boldly insist upon it, he is irresistible. * * * His office is anything he has the sagacity and force to make it.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn25" id="fn25_ref"&gt;25&lt;/a&gt; I cannot be brought to believe that this country will suffer if the Court refuses further to aggrandize the presidential office, already so potent and so relatively immune from judicial review,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn26" id="fn26_ref"&gt;26&lt;/a&gt; at the expense of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p372"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;372&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;But I have no illusion that any decision by this Court can keep power in the hands of Congress if it is not wise and timely in meeting its problems. A crisis that challenges the President equally, or perhaps primarily, challenges Congress. If not good law, there was worldly wisdom in the maxim attributed to Napoleon that 'The tools belong to the man who can use them.' We may say that power to legislate for emergencies belongs in the hands of Congress, but only Congress itself can prevent power from slipping through its fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p373"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;373&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The essence of our free Government is 'leave to live by no man's leave, underneath the law'&amp;#8212;to be governed by those impersonal forces which we call law. Our Government is fashioned to fulfill this concept so far as humanly possible. The Executive, except for recommendation and veto, has no legislative power. The executive action we have here originates in the individual will of the President and represents an exercise of authority without law. No one, perhaps not even the President, knows the limits of the power he may seek to exert in this instance and the parties affected cannot learn the limit of their rights. We do not know today what powers over labor or property would be claimed to flow from Government possession if we should legalize it, what rights to compensation would be claimed or recognized, or on what contingency it would end. With all its defects, delays and inconveniences, men have discovered no technique for long preserving free government except that the Executive be under the law, and that the law be made by parliamentary deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p374"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;374&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Such institutions may be destined to pass away. But it is the duty of the Court to be last, not first, to give them up.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn27" id="fn27_ref"&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p375"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;375&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Justice BURTON, concurring in both the opinion and judgment of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class="indent"&gt;My position may be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p376"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;376&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The validity of the President's order of seizure is at issue and ripe for decision. Its validity turns upon its relation to the constitutional division of governmental power between Congress and the President.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p377"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;377&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Constitution has delegated to Congress power to authorize action to meet a national emergency of the kind we face.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1-5" id="fn1-5_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; Aware of this responsibility, Congress has responded to it. It has provided at least two procedures for the use of the President.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p378"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;378&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;It has outlined one in the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, better known as the Taft-Hartley Act. The accuracy with which Congress there describes the present emergency demonstrates its applicability. It says:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p379"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;379&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Whenever in the opinion of the President of the United      States, a threatened or actual strike or lock-out affecting      an entire industry or a substantial part thereof engaged in      trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or      communication among the several States or with foreign      nations, or engaged in the production of goods for commerce,      will, if permitted to occur or to continue, imperil the      national health or safety, he may appoint a board of inquiry      to inquire into the issues involved in the dispute and to      make a written report to him within such time as he shall      prescribe. * * *'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2-5" id="fn2-5_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p380"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;380&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In that situation Congress has authorized not only negotiation, conciliation and impartial inquiry but also a 60-day cooling-off period under injunction, followed by 20 days for a secret ballot upon the final offer of settlement and then by recommendations from the President to Congress.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p381"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;381&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;For the purposes of this case the most significant feature of that Act is its omission of authority to seize an affected industy. The debate preceding its passage demonstrated the significance of that omission. Collective bargaining, rather than governmental seizure, was to be relied upon. Seizure was not to be resorted to without specific congressional authority. Congress reserved to itself the opportunity to authorize seizure to meet particular emergencies.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4-5" id="fn4-5_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p382"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;382&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The President, however, chose not to use the Taft-Hartley procedure. He chose another course, also authorized by Congress. He referred the controversy to the Wage Stabilization Board.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; If that course had led to a settlement of the labor dispute, it would have avoided the need for other action. It, however, did not do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p383"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;383&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Now it is contended that although the President did not follow the procedure authorized by the Taft-Hartley Act, his substituted procedure served the same purpose and must be accepted as it equivalent. Without appraising that equivalence, it is enough to point out that neither procedure carried statutory authority for the seizure of private industries in the manner now at issue.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; The exhaustion of both procedures fails to cloud the clarity of the congressional reservation of seizure for its own consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p384"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;384&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The foregoing circumstances distinguish this emergency from one in which Congress takes no action and outlines no governmental policy. In the case before us, Congress authorized a procedure which the President declined to follow. Instead, he followed another procedure which he hoped might eliminate the need for the first. Upon its failure, he issued an executive order to seize the steel properties in the fact of the reserved right of Congress to adopt or reject that course as a matter of legislative policy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p385"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;385&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This brings us to a further crucial question. Does not President, in such a situation, have inherent constitutional power to seize private property which makes congressional action in relation thereto unnecessary? We find no such power available to him under the present circumstances. The present situation is not comparable to that of an imminent invasion or threatened attack. We do not face the issue of what might be the President's constitutional power to meet such catastrophic situations. Nor is it claimed that the current seizure is in the nature of a military command addressed by the President, as Commander-in-Chief, to a mobilized nation waging, or imminently threatened with, total war.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p386"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;386&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The controlling fact here is that Congress, within its constitutionally delegated power, has prescribed for the President specific procedures, exclusive of seizure, for his use in meeting the present type of emergency. Congress has reserved to itself the right to determine where and when to authorize the seizure of property in meeting such an emergency. Under these circumstances, the President's order of April 8 invaded the jurisdiction of Congress. It violated the essence of the principle of the separation of governmental powers. Accordingly, the injunction against its effectiveness should be sustained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p387"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;387&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Justice CLARK, concurring in the judgment of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p388"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;388&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;One of this Court's first pronouncements upon the powers of the President under the Constitution was made by Chief Justice John Marshall some one hundred and fifty years ago. In Little v. Barreme,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1-6" id="fn1-6_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; he used this characteristically clear language in discussing the power of the President to instruct the seizure of the 'Flying-Fish,' a vessel bound from a French port: 'It is by no means clear that the President of the United States whose high duty it is to 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed,' and who is commander in chief of the armies and navies of the United States, might not, without any special authority for that purpose, in the then existing state of things, have empowered the officers commanding the armed vessels of the United States, to seize and send into port for adjudication, American vessels which were forfeited by being engaged in this illicit commerce. But when it is observed that (an act of Congress) gives a special authority to seize on the high seas, and limits that authority to the seizure of vessels bound or sailing to a French port, the legislature seem to have prescribed that the manner in which this law shall be carried into execution, was to exclude a seizure of any vessel not bound to a French port.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2-6" id="fn2-6_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; Accordingly, a unanimous Court held that the President's instructions had been issued without authority and that they could not 'legalize an act which without those instructions would have been a plain trespass.' I know of no subsequent holding of this Court to the contrary.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p389"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;389&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The limits of presidential power are obscure. However, Article II, no less than Article I, is part of 'a constitution intended to endure for ages to come, and, consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4-6" id="fn4-6_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; Some of our Presidents, such as Lincoln, 'felt that measures otherwise unconstitutional might become lawful by becoming indispensable to the preservation of the Constitution through the preservation of the nation.'&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Others, such as Theodore Roosevelt, thought the President to be capable, as a 'steward' of the people, of exerting all power save that which is specifically prohibited by the Constitution or the Congress.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; In my view&amp;#8212;taught me not only by the decision of Chief Justice Marshall in Little v. Barreme, 2 Cranch 170, 2 L.Ed. 243, but also by a score of other pronouncements of distinguished members of this bench&amp;#8212;the Constitution does grant to the President extensive authority in times of grave and imperative national emergency. In fact, to my thinking, such a grant may well be necessary to the very existence of the Constitution itself. As Lincoln aptly said, '(is) it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the Constitution?'&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; In describing this authority I care not whether one calls it 'residual,' 'inherent,' 'moral, 'implied,' 'aggregate,? 'emergency,' or otherwise. I am of the conviction that those who have had the grantifying experience of being the President's lawyer have used one or more of these adjectives only with the utmost of sincerity and the highest of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p390"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;390&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;I conclude that where Congress has laid down specific procedures to deal with the type of crisis confronting the President, he must follow those procedures in meeting the crisis; but that in the absence of such action by Congress, the President's independent power to act depends upon the gravity of the situation contronting the nation. I cannot sustain the seizure in question because here, as in Little v. Barreme, 2 Crahch 170, 2 L.Ed. 243, Congfress had prescribed methods to be followed by the President in meeting the emergency at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p391"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;391&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Three statutory procecures were available: those provided in the Defense Production Act of 1950, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, &amp;#167; 2061 et seq., the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 141 et seq., and the Selective Service Act of 1948, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, &amp;#167; 451 et seq. In this case the President invoked the first of these procedures; he did not invoke the other two.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p392"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;392&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Defense Production Act of 1950 provides for mediation of labor disputes affecting national defense. Under this statutory authorization, the President has established the Wage Stabilization Board. The Defense Production Act, however, grants the President no power to seize real property except through ordinary condemnation proceedings, which were not used here, and creates no sanctions for the settlement of labor disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p393"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;393&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Labor Management Relations Act, commonly known as the Taft-Hartley Act, includes provisions adopted for the purpose of dealing with nationwide strikes. They establish a procedure whereby the President may appoint a board of inquiry and thereafter, in proper cases, seek injunctive relief for an 80-day period against a threatened work stoppage. The President can invoke that procedure whenever, in his opinion, 'a threatened or actual strike * * * affecting an entire industry * * * will, if permitted to occur or to continue, imperil the national health or safety.'&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; At the time that Act was passed, Congress specifically rejected a proposal to empower the President to seize any 'plant, mine, or facility' in which a threatened work stoppage would, in his judgment, 'imperil the public health or security.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn9-2" id="fn9-2_ref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt; Instead, the Taft-Hartley Act directed the President, in the event a strike had not been settled during the 80-day injunction period, to submit to Congress 'a full and comprehensive report * * * together with such recommendations as he may see fit to make for consideration and appropriate action.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn10-2" id="fn10-2_ref"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; The legislative history of the Act demonstrates Congress' belief that the 80-day period would afford it adequate opportunity to determine whether special legislation should be enacted to meet the emergency at hand.&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p394"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;394&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Selective Service Act of 1948 gives the President specific authority to seize plants which fail to produce goods required by the armed forces or the Atomic Energy Commission for national defense purposes. The Act provides that when a producer from whom the President has ordered such goods 'refuses or fails' to fill the order within a period of time prescribed by the President, the President may take immediate possession of the producer's plant.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn12-2" id="fn12-2_ref"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; This language is significantly broader than that used in the National Defense Act of 1916 and the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, which provided for seizure when a producer 'refused' to supply essential defense materials, but not when he 'failed' to do so.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn13-2" id="fn13-2_ref"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p395"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;395&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;These three statutes furnish the guideposts for decision in this case. Prior to seizing the steel mills on April 8 the President had exhausted the mediation procedures of the Defense Production Act through the Wage Stabilization Board. Use of those procedures had failed to avert the impending crisis; however, it had resulted in a 99-day postponement of the strike. The Government argues that this accomplished more than the maximum 80-day waiting period possible under the sanctions of the Taft-Hartley Act, and therefore amounted to compliance with the substance of that Act. Even if one were to accept this somewhat hyperbolic conclusion, the hard fact remains that neither the Defense Production Act nor Taft-Hartley authorized the seizure challenged here, and the Government made no effort to comply with the procedures established by the Selective Service Act of 1948, a statute which expressly authorizes seizures when producers fail to supply necessary defense mate riel.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn14-2" id="fn14-2_ref"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p396"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;396&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;For these reasons I concur in the judgment of the Court. As Justice Story once said: 'For the executive department of the government, this court entertain the most entire respect; and amidst the multiplicity of cares in that department, it may, without any violation of decorum, be presumed, that sometimes there may be an inaccurate construction of a law. It is our duty to expound the laws as we find them in the records of state; and we cannot, when called upon by the citizens of the country, refuse our opinion, however it may differ from that of very great authorities.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn15-2" id="fn15-2_ref"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p397"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;397&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Mr. Chief Justice VINSON, with whom Mr. Justice REED and Mr. Justice MINTON join, dissenting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p398"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;398&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The President of the United States directed the Secretary of Commerce to take temporary possession of the Nation's steel mills during the existing emergency because 'a work stoppage would immediately jeopardize and imperil our national defense and the defense of those joined with us in resisting aggression, and would add to the continuing danger of our soldiers, sailors and airmen engaged in combat in the field.' The District Court ordered the mills returned to their private owners on the ground that the President's acion was beyond his powers under the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p399"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;399&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This Court affirms. Some members of the Court are of the view that the President is without power to act in time of crisis in the absence of express statutory authorization. Other members of the Court affirm on the basis of their reading of certain statutes. Because we cannot agree that affirmance is proper on any ground, and because of the transcending importance of the questions presented not only in this critical litigation but also to the powers the President and of future Presidents to act in time of crisis, we are compelled to register this dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p400"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In passing upon the question of Presidential powers in this case, we must first consider the context in which those powers were exercised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p401"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;401&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Those who suggest that this is a case involving extraordinary powers should be mindful that these are extraordinary times. A world not yet recovered from the devastation of World War II has been forced to face the threat of another and more terrifying global conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p402"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;402&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Accepting in full measure its responsibility in the world community, the United States was instrumental in securing adoption of the United Nations Charter, approved by the Senate by a vote of 89 to 2. The first purpose of the United Nations is to 'maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, * * *.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1-7" id="fn1-7_ref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; In 1950, when the United Nations called upon member nations 'to render every assistance' to repel aggression in Korea, the United States furnished its vigorous support.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2-7" id="fn2-7_ref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; For almost two full years, our armed forces have been fighting in Korea, suffering casualties of over 108,000 men. Hostilities have not abated. The 'determination of the United Nations to continue its action in Korea to meet the aggression' has been reaffirmend.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Congressional support of the action in Korea has been manifested by provisions for increased military manpower and equipment and for economic stabilization, as hereinafter described.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p403"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;403&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Further efforts to protect the free world from aggression are found in the congressional enactments of the Truman Plan for assistance to Greece and Turkey&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn4-7" id="fn4-7_ref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and the Marshall Plan for economic aid needed to build up the strength of our friends in Western Europe.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; In 1949, the Senate approved the North Atlantic Treaty under which each member nation agrees that an armed attack against one is an armed attack against all.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Congress immediately implemented the North Atlantic Treaty by authorizing military assistance to nations dedicated to the principles of mutual security under the United Nations Charter.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; The concept of mutual security recently has been extended by treaty to friends in the Pacific.&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p404"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Our treaties represent not merely legal obligations but show congressional recognition that mutual security for the free world is the best security against the threat of aggression on a global scale. The need for mutual security is shown by the very size of the armed forces outside the free world. Defendant's brief informs us that the Soviet Unin maintains the largest air force in the world and maintains g round forces much larger than those presently available to the United States and the countries joined with us in mutual security arrangements. Constant international tensions are cited to demonstrate how precarious is the peace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p405"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;405&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Even this brief review of our responsibilities in the world community discloses the enormity of our undertaking. Success of these measures may, as has often been observed, dramatically influence the lives of many generations of the world's peoples yet unborn. Alert to our responsibilities, which coincide with our own self preservation through mutual security, Congress has enacted a large body of implementing legislation. As an illustration of the magnitude of the over-all program, Congress has appropriated $130 billion for our own defense and for military assistance to our allies since the June, 1950, attack in Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p406"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;406&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In the Mutual Security Act of 1951, Congress authorized 'military, economic, and technical assistance to friendly countries to strengthen the mutual security and individual and collective defenses of the free world, * * *.'&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Over $5 1/2 billion were appropriated for military assistance for fiscal year 1952, the bulk of that amount to be devoted to purchase of military equipment.&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; A request for over $7 billion for the same purpose for fiscal year 1953 is currently pending in Congress.&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; In addition to direct shipment of military equipment to nations of the free world, defense production in those countries relies upon shipment of machine tools and allocation of steel tonnage from the United States.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn12-3" id="fn12-3_ref"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p407"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;407&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Congress also directed the President to build up our own defenses. Congress, recognizing the 'grim fact * * * that the United States is now engaged in a struggle for survival' and that 'it is imperative that we now take those necessary steps to make our strength equal to the peril of the hour,' granted authority to draft men into the armed forces.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn13-3" id="fn13-3_ref"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; As a result, we now have over 3,500,000 men in our armed forces.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn14-3" id="fn14-3_ref"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p408"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;408&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Appropriations for the Department of Defense, which had averaged less than $13 billion per year for the three years before attack in Korea, were increased by Congress to $48 billion for fiscal year 1951 and to $60 billion for fiscal year 1952.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn15-3" id="fn15-3_ref"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt; A request for $51 billion for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1953 is currently pending in Congress.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn16-2" id="fn16-2_ref"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt; The bulk of the increase is for military equipment and supplies&amp;#8212;guns, tanks, ships, planes and ammunition&amp;#8212;all of which require steel. Other defense programs requiring great quantities of steel include the large scale expansion of facilities for the Atomic Energy Commission&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn17-2" id="fn17-2_ref"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt; and the expansion of the Nation's productive capacity affirmatively encouraged by Congress.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn18-2" id="fn18-2_ref"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p409"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;409&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Congress recognized the impact of these defense programs upon the economy. Following the attack in Korea, the President asked for authority to requisition property and to allocate and fix priorities for scarce goods. In the Defense Production Act of 1950, Congress granted the powers requested and, in addition, granted power to stabilize prices and wages and to provide for settlement of labor disputes arising in the defense program.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn19-2" id="fn19-2_ref"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt; The Defense Production Act was extended in 1951, a Senate Committee noting that in the dislocation caused by the programs for purchase of military equipment 'lies the seed of an economic disaster that might well destroy the military might we are straining to build.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn20-2" id="fn20-2_ref"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt; Significantly, the Committee examined the problem 'in terms of just one commodity, steel,' and found 'a graphic picture of the over-all inflationary danger growing out of reduced civilian supplies and rising incomes.' Even before Korea, steel production at levels above theoretical 100% capacity was not capable of supplying civilian needs alone. Since Korea, the tremendous military demand for steel has far exceeded the increases in productive capacity. This Committee emphasized that the shortage of steel, even with the mills operating at full capacity, coupled with increased civilian purchasing power, presented grave danger of disastrous inflation.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn21-1" id="fn21-1_ref"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p410"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;410&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The President has the duty to execute the foregoing legislative programs. Their successful execution depends upon continued production of steel and stabilized prices for steel. Accordingly, when the collective bargaining agreements between the Nation's steel producers and their employees, represented by the United Steel Workers, were due to expire on December 31, 1951, and a strike shutting down the entire basic steel industry was threatened, the President acted to avert a complete shutdown of steel production. On December 22, 1951, he certified the dispute to the Wage Stabilization Board, requesting that the Board investigate the dispute and promptly report its recommendation as to fair and equitable terms of settlement. The Union complied with the President's request and delayed its threatened strike while the dispute was before the Board. After a special Board panel had conducted hearings and submitted a report, the full Wage Stabilization Board submitted its report and recommendations to the President on March 20, 1952.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p411"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;411&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Board's report was acceptable to the Union but was rejected by plaintiffs. The Union gave notice of its intention to strike as of 12:01 a.m., April 9, 1952, but bargaining between the parties continued with hope of settlement until the evening of April 8, 1952. After bargaining had failed to avert the threatened shutdown of steel production, the President issued the following Executive Order:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p412"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;412&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Whereas on December 16, 1950, I proclaimed the existence of      a national emergency which requires that the military, naval,      air, and civilian defenses of this country be strengthened as      speedily as possible to the end that we may be able to repel      any and all threats against our national security and to      fulfill our responsibilities in the efforts being made      throughout the United Nations and otherwise to bring about a      lasting peace; and&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'The Congress is undoubtedly aware of the recent events which      have taken place in connection with the management-labor      dispute in the steel industry.

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;426&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'One alternative would have been to permit a shut-down in the      steel industry. The effects of such a shut-down would have      been so immediate and damaging with respect to our efforts to      support our Armed Forces and to protect our national security      that it made this alternative unthinkable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p427"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;427&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'The only way that I know of, other than Government           operation, by which a steel shut-down could have been           avoided was to grant the demands of the steel industry           for a large price increase. I believed and the officials           in charge of our stabilization agencies believed that           this would have wrecked our stabilization program. I was           unwilling to accept the incalculable damage which might           be done to our country by following such a course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p428"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;428&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Accordingly, it was my judgment that Government operation of      the steel mills for a temporary period was the least      undesirable of the courses of action which lay open. In the      circumstances, I believed it to be, and now believe it to be,      my duty and within my powers as President to follow that      courseof action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;429&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'It may be that the Congress will deem some othe r course to      be wiser. It may be that the Congress will feel we should      give in to the demands of the steel industry for an      exorbitant price increase and take the consequences so far as      resulting inflation is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p430"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;430&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'It may be that the Congress will feel the Government should      try to force the steel workers to continue to work for the      steel companies for another long period, without a contract,      even though the steel workers have already voluntarily      remained at work without a contract for 100 days in an effort      to reach an orderly settlement of their differences with      management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p431"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;431&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'It may even be that the Congress will feel that we should      permit a shutdown of the steel industry, although that would      immediately endanger the safety of our fighting forces abroad      and weaken the whole structure of our national security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p432"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;432&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'I do not believe the Congress will favor any of these           courses of action, but that is a matter for the Congress           to determine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p433"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;433&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'It may be, on the other hand, that the Congress will wish to      pass legislation establishing specific terms and conditions      with reference to the operation of the steel mills by the      Government. Sound legislation of this character might be very      desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p434"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;434&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'On the basis of the facts that are known to me at this time,      I do not believe that immediate congressional action is      essential; but I would, of course, be glad to cooperate in      developing any legislative proposals which the Congress may      wish to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'If the Congress does not deem it necessary to act at this      time, I shall continue to do all that is within my power to      keep the steel industry operating and at the same time make      every effort to bring about a settlement of the dispute so      the mills can be returned to their private owners as soon as      possible.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn23-1" id="fn23-1_ref"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;436&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Twelve days passed without action by Congress. On April 21, 1952, the President sent a letter to the President of the Senate in which he again described the purpose and need for his action and again stated his position that 'The Congress can, if it wishes, reject the course of action I have followed in this matter.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn24-1" id="fn24-1_ref"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt; Congress has not so acted to this date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p437"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;437&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Meanwhile, plaintiffs instituted this action in the District Court to compel defendant to return possession of the steel mills seized under Executive Order 10340. In this litigation for return of plaintiffs' properties, we assume that defendant Charles Sawyer is not immune from judicial restraint and that plaintiffs are entitled to equitable relief if we find that the Executive Order under which defendant acts is unconstitutional. We also assume without deciding that the courts may go behind a President'sfinding of fact that an emergency exists. But there is not the slightest basis for suggesting that the President's finding in this case can be undermined. Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction before answer or hearing. Defendant opposed the motion, filing uncontroverted affidavits of Government officials describing the facts underlying the President's order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p438"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;438&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Secretary of Defense Lovett swore that 'a work stoppage in the steel industry will result immediately in serious curtailment of production of essential weapons and munitions of all kinds.' He illustrated by showing that 84% of the national production of certain alloy steel is currently used for production of military-end items and that 35% of total production of another form of steel goes into ammunition, 80% of such ammunition now going to Korea. The Secretary of Defense stated that: 'We are holding the line (in Korea) with ammunition and not with the lives of our troops.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p439"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;439&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Affidavits of the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, the Secretary of the Interior, defendant as Secretary of Commerce, and the Administrators of the Defense Production Administration, the National Production Authority, the General Servies Administration and the Defense Transport Administration wer e also filed in the District Court. These affidavits disclose an enormous demand for steel in such vital defense programs as the expansion of facilities in atomic energy, petroleum, power, transportation and industrial production, including steel production. Those charged with administering allocations and priorities swore to the vital part steel production plays in our economy. The affidavits emphasize the critical need for steel in our defense program, the absence of appreciable inventories of steel, and the drastic results of any interruption in steel production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p440"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;440&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;One is not here called upon even to consider the possibility of executive seizure of a farm, a corner grocery store or even a single industrial plant. Such considerations arise only when one ignores the central fact of this case&amp;#8212;that the Nation's entire basic steel production would have shut down completely if there had been no Government seizure. Even ignoring for the moment whatever confidential information the President may possess as 'the Nation's organ for foreign affairs,'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn25-1" id="fn25-1_ref"&gt;25&lt;/a&gt; the uncontroverted affidavits in this record amply support the finding that 'a work stoppage would immediately jeopardize and imperil our national defense.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p441"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;441&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Plaintiffs do not remotely suggest any basis for rejecting the President's finding that any stoppage of steel production would immediately place the Nation in peril. Moreover, even self-generated doubts that any stoppage of steel production constitutes an emergency are of little comfort here. The Union and the plaintiffs bargained for 6 months with over 100 issues in dispute&amp;#8212;issues not limited to wage demands but including the union shop and other matters of principle between the parties. At the time of seizure there was not, and there is not now, the slightest evidence to justify the belief that any strike will be of short duration. The Union and the steel companies may well engage in a lengthy struggle. Plaintiff's counsel tells us that 'sooner or later' the mills will operate again. That May satisfy the steel companies and, perhaps, the Union. But our soldiers and our allies will hardly be cheered with the assurance that the ammunition upon which their lives depend will be forthcoming&amp;#8212;'sooner or later,' or, in other words, 'too little and too late.' Accordingly, if the President has any power under the Constitution to meet a critical situation in the absence of express statutory authorization, there is no basis whatever for criticizing the exercise of such power in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;II.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p442"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;442&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The steel mills were seized for a public use. The power of eminent domain, invoked in that case, is an essential attribute of sovereignty and has long been recognized as a power of the Federal Government. Kohl v. United States, 1876, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/svL/kohl-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;91&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;367&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 23 L.Ed. 449. Plaintiffs cannot complain that any provision in the Constitution prohibits the exercise of the power of eminent domain in this case. The Fifth Amendment provides: 'nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.' It is no bar to this seizure for, if the taking is not otherwise unlawful, plaintiffs are assured of receiving the required just compensation. United States v. Pewee Coal Co., 1951, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/xbv/united-states-v-pewee-coal-co-inc/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;341&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;114&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 71 S.Ct. 670, 95 L.Ed. 809.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p443"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;443&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Admitting that the Government could seize the mills, plaintiffs claim that the implied power of eminent domain can be exercised only under an Act of Congress; under no circumstances, they say, can that power be exercised by the President unless he can point to an express provision in enabling legislation. This was the view adopted by the District Judge when he granted the preliminary injunction. Without an answer, without hearing evidence, he determined the issue on the basis of his 'fixed conclusion * * * that defendant's acts are illegal' because the President's only course in the face of an emergency is to pr esent the matter to Congress and await the final passage of legislation which will enable the Government to cope with threatened disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p444"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;444&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Under this view, the President is left powerless at the very moment when the need for action may be most pressing and when no one, other than he, is immediately capable of action. Under this view, he is left powerless because a power not expressly given to Congress is nevertheless found to rest exclusively with Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p445"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;445&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Consideration of this view of executive impotence calls for further examination of the nature of the separation of powers under our tripartite system of Government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Constitution provides:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p455"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;455&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The whole of the 'executive Power' is vested in the President. Before entering office, the President swears that he 'will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of (his) Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.' Art. II, &amp;#167; 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p456"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;456&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This comprehensive grant of the executive power to a single person was bestowed soon after the country had thrown the yoke of monarchy. Only by instilling initiative and vigor in all of the three departments of Government, declared Madison, could tyranny in any from be avoided.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn26-1" id="fn26-1_ref"&gt;26&lt;/a&gt; Hamilton added: 'Energy in the Executive is a leading character in the definition of good government. It is essential to the protection of the community against foreign attack; it is not less essential to the steady administration of the laws; to the protection of property against those irregular and highhanded combinations which sometimes interrupt the ordinary course of justice; to the security of liberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition, of faction, and of anarchy.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn27-1" id="fn27-1_ref"&gt;27&lt;/a&gt; It is thus apparent that the Presidency was deliberately fashioned as an office of power and independence. Of course, the Framers created no autocrat capable of arrogating any power unto himself at any time. But neither did they create an automaton impotent to exercise the powers of Government at a time when the survival of the Republic itself may be at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p457"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;457&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In passing upon the grave constitutional question presented in this case, we must never forget, as Chief Justice Marshall admonished, that the Constitution is 'intended to endure for ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs,' and that '(i)ts means are adequate to its ends.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn28" id="fn28_ref"&gt;28&lt;/a&gt; Cases do arise presenting questions which could not have been foreseen by the Framers. In such cases, the Constitution has been treated as a living document adaptable to new situations.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn29" id="fn29_ref"&gt;29&lt;/a&gt; But we are not called upon today to expand the Constitution to meet a new situation. For, in this case, we need only look to history and time-honored principles of constitutional law&amp;#8212;principles that have been applied consistently by all branches of the Government thrughout our history. It is those who assert the invalidity of t he Executive Order who seek to amend the Constitution in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;III.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p458"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;458&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;A review of executive action demonstrates that our Presidents have on many occasions exhibited the leadership contemplated by the Framers when they made the President Commander in Chief, and imposed upon him the trust to 'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.' With or without explicit statutory authorization, Presidents have at such times dealt with national emergencies by acting promptly and resolutely to enforce legislative programs, at least to save those programs until Congress could act. Congress and the courts have responded to such executive initiative with consistent approval.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p459"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;459&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Our first President displayed at once the leadership contemplated by the Framers. When the national revenue laws were openly flouted in some sections of Pennsylvania, President Washington, without waiting for a call from the state government, summoned the militia and took decisive steps to secure the faithful execution of the laws.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn30" id="fn30_ref"&gt;30&lt;/a&gt; When international disputes engendered by the French revolution threatened to involve this country in war, and while congressional policy remained undertain, Washington issued his Proclamation of Neutrality. Hamilton, whose defense of the Proclamation has endured the test of time, invoked the argument that the Executive has the duty to do that which will preserve peace until Congress acts and, in addition, pointed to the need for keeping the Nation informed of the requirements of existing laws and treaties as part of the faithful execution of the laws.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn31" id="fn31_ref"&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p460"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;460&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;President John Adams issued a warrant for the arrest of Jonathan Robbins in order to execute the extradition provisions of a treaty. This action was challenged in Congress on the ground that no specific statute prescribed the method to be used in executing the treaty. John Marshall, then a member of the House of Representatives, made the following argument in support of the President's action:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p461"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;461&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'The treaty, which is a law, enjoins the performance of a      particular object. The person who is to perform this object      is marked out by the Constitution, since the person is named      who conducts the foreign intercourse, and is to take care      that the laws be faithfully executed. The means by which it      is to be performed, the force of the nation, are in the hands      of this person. Ought not this person to perform the object,      although the particular mode of using the means has not been      prescribed? Congress, unquestionably may prescribe the mode,      and Congress may devolve on others the whole execution of the      contract; but, till this be done, it seems the duty of the      Executive department to execute the contract by any means it      possesses.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn32" id="fn32_ref"&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p462"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;462&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Efforts in Congress to discredit the President for his action failed.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn33" id="fn33_ref"&gt;33&lt;/a&gt; Almost a century later, this Court had occasion to give its express approval to 'the masterly and conclusive argument of John Marshall.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn34" id="fn34_ref"&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p463"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;463&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Jefferson's initiative in the Louisiana Purchase, the Monroe Doctrine, and Jackson's removal of Government deposits from the Bank of the United States further serve to demonstrate by deed what the Framers described by word when they vested the whole of the executive power in the President.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p464"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;464&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Without declaration of war, President Lincoln took energetic action with the outreak of the War Between the States. He summoned troops and pai d them out of the Treasury without appropriation therefor. He proclaimed a naval blockade of the Confederacy and seized ships violating that blockade. Congress, far from denying the validity of these acts, gave them express approval. The most striking action of President Lincoln was the Emancipation Proclamation, issued in aid of the successful prosecution of the War Between the States, but wholly without statutory authority.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn35" id="fn35_ref"&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p465"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;465&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In an action furnishing a most apt precedent for this case, President Lincoln without statutory authority directed the seizure of rail and telegraph lines leading to Washington.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn36" id="fn36_ref"&gt;36&lt;/a&gt; Many months later, Congress recognized and confirmed the power of the President to seize railroads and telegraph lines and provided criminal penalties for interference with Government operation.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn37" id="fn37_ref"&gt;37&lt;/a&gt; This Act did not confer on the President any additional powers of seizure. Congress plainly rejected the view that the President's acts had been without legal sanction until ratified by the legislature. Sponsors of the bill declared that its purpose was only to confirm the power which the President already possessed.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn38" id="fn38_ref"&gt;38&lt;/a&gt; Opponents insisted a statute authorizing seizure was unnecessary and might even be construed as limiting existing Presidential powers.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn39" id="fn39_ref"&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p466"&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Other seizures of private property occurred during the War Between the States, just as they had occurred during previous wars.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn40" id="fn40_ref"&gt;40&lt;/a&gt; In United States v.

This Court affirmed an award of compensation, stating:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Extraordinary and unforeseen occasions arise, however,      beyond all doubt, in cases of extreme necessity in time of      war or of immediate and impending public danger, in which      private property may be impressed into the public service, or      may be seized and appropriated to the public use, or may even      be destroyed without the consent of the owner.'&lt;/p&gt;

Such a justification may      be shown, and when shown the rule is well settled that the      officer taking private property for such a purpose, if the      emergency is fully proved, is not a trespasser, and that the      government is bound to make full compensation to the      owner.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn41" id="fn41_ref"&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It was conceded that there was no specific statute authorizing the President to assign such a guard. In holding that such a statute was not necessary, the Court broadly stated the question as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p470"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;470&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;471&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Is this duty limited to the enforcement of acts of Congress      or of treaties of the United States according to their      express terms, or does it include the rights, duties and      obligations growing out of the Constitution itself, our      international relations, and all the protection implied by      the nature of the government under the Constitution?'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn42" id="fn42_ref"&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;President Hayes authorized the widespread use of federal troops during the Railroad Strike of 1877.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn43" id="fn43_ref"&gt;43&lt;/a&gt; President Cleveland also used the troops in the Pullman Strike of 1895 and his action is of special significance. No statute authorized this action. No call for help had issued from the Governor of Illinois; indeed Governor Altgeld disclaimed the need for supplemental forces. But the President's concern was that federal laws relating to the free flow of interstate commerce and the mails be continuously and faithfully executed without interruption.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn44" id="fn44_ref"&gt;44&lt;/a&gt; To further this aim his agents sought and obtained the injunction upheld by this Court in In re Debs, 1895, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/u1N/in-re-debs/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;158&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;564&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 15 S.Ct. 900, 39 L.Ed. 1092. The Court scrutinized each of the steps taken by the President to insure execution of the 'mass of legislation' dealing with commerce and the mails and gave his conduct full approval. Congress likewise took note of this use of Presidential power to forestall apparent obstacles to the faithful execution of the laws. By separate resolutions, both the Senate and the House commended the Executive's action.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn45" id="fn45_ref"&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;President Theodore Roosevelt seriously contemplated seizure of Pennsylvania coal mines if a coal shortage necessitated such action.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn46" id="fn46_ref"&gt;46&lt;/a&gt; In his autobiography, President Roosevelt expounded the 'Stewardship Theory' of Presidential power, stating that 'the executive is subject only to the people, and, under the Constitution, bound to serve the people affirmatively in cases where the Constitution does not explicitly forbid him to render the service.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn47" id="fn47_ref"&gt;47&lt;/a&gt; Because the contemplated seizure of the coal mines was based on this theory, then ex-President Taft criticized President Roosevelt in a passage in his book relied upon by the District Court in this case. Taft, Our Chief Magistrate and His Powers (1915), 139&amp;#8212;147. In the same book, however, President Taft agreed that such powers of the President as the duty 'to take care that the laws be faithfully executed' could not be confined to 'express Congressional statutes.' In re Neagle, supra, and In re Debs, supra, were cited as conforming with Taft's concept of the office, id., at pp. 88&amp;#8212;94, as they were later to be cited with approval in his opinion as Chief Justice in Myers v. United States, 1926, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/w17/myers-v-united-states/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;272&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;52&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 133, 47 S.Ct. 21, 31, 71 L.Ed. 160.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn48" id="fn48_ref"&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In 1909, President Taft was informed that government owned oil lands were being patented by private parties at such a rate tht public oil lands would be depleted in a matter of months. Al though Congress had explicitly provided that these lands were open to purchase by United States citizens, 29 Stat. 526 (1897), the President nevertheless ordered the lands withdrawn from sale '(i)n aid of proposed legislation.' In United States v. Midwest Oil Co., 1915, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/vff/united-states-v-midwest-oil-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;236&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;459&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 35 S.Ct. 309, 59 L.Ed. 673, the President's action was sustained as consistent with executive practice throughout our history. An excellent brief was filed in the case by the Solicitor General, Mr. John W. Davis, together with Assistant Attorney General Knaebel, later Reporter for this Court. In this brief, the situation confronting President Taft was described as 'an emergency; there was no time to wait for the action of Congress.' The brief then discusses the powers of the President under the Constitution in such a case:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p476"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;476&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Ours is a self-sufficient Government within its sphere. (Ex      parte Siebold, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/sLs/ex-parte-siebold/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;371&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 395 (25 L.Ed. 717); In re Debs,      &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/u1N/in-re-debs/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;158&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;564&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 578 (15 S.Ct. 900, 39 L.Ed. 1092).) 'Its means      are adequate to its ends' (McCulloch v. (State of) Maryland,      &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/7LyH/mcculloch-v-maryland/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;Wheat.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;316&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 424 (4 L.Ed. 579)), and it is rational to assume      that its active forces will be found equal in most things to      the emergencies that confront it. While perfect flexibility      is not to be expected in a Government of divided powers, and      while division of power is one of the principal features of      the Constitution, it is the plain duty of those who are      called upon to draw the dividing lines to ascertain the      essential, recognize the practical, and avoid a slavish      formalism which can only serve to ossify the Government and      reduce its efficiency without any compensating good. The      function of making laws is peculiar to Congress, and the      Executive can not exercise that function to any degree. But      this is not to say that all of the subjects concerning which      laws might be made are perforce removed from the possibility      of Executive influence. The Executive may act upon things and      upon men in many relations which have not, though they might      have, been actually regulated by Congress. In other words,      just as there are fields which are peculiar to Congress and      fields which are peculiar to the Executive, so there are      fields which are common to both, in the sense that the      Executive may move within them until they shall have been      occupied by legislative action. These are not the fields of      legislative prerogative, but fields within which the      lawmaking power may enter and dominate whenever it chooses.      This situation results from the fact that the President is      the active agent, not of Congress, but of the Nation. As such      he performs the duties which the Constitution lays upon him      immediately, and as such, also, he executes the laws and      regulations adopted by Congress. He is the agent of the      people of the United States, deriving all his powers from      them and responsible directly to them. In no sense is he the agent of Congress. He obeys and executes the      laws of Congress, not because Congress is enthroned in      authority over him, but because the Constitution directs him      to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p477"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;477&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Therefore it follows that in ways short of making laws or      disobeying them, the Executive may be under a grave      constitutional duty to act for the national protection in      situations not covered by the acts of Congress, and in which,      even, it may not be said that his action is the direct      expression of any particular one of the independent powers      which are granted to him specifically by the Constitution.      Instances wherein the President has felt and fulfilled such a      duty have not been rare in our history, though, being for the      public benefit and approved by all, his acts have seldom been      challenged in the courts. We are able, however, to present a      number of apposite cases which were subjected to judicial      inquiry.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p478"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;478&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The brief then quotes from such cases as In re Debs, supra, and In re Neagle, supra, and continues:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p479"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;479&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'As we understand the doctrine of the Neagle case, and the      cases therein citd, it is clearly this: The Executive is      authorized to exert th e power of the United States when he      finds this necessary for the protection of the agencies, the      instrumentalities, or the property of the Government. This      does not mean an authority to disregard the wishes of      Congress on the subject, when that subject lies within its      control and when those wishes have been expressed, and it      certainly does not involve the slightest semblance of a power      to legislate, much less to 'suspend' legislation already      passed by Congress. It involves the performance of specific      acts, not of a legislative but purely of an executive character&amp;#8212;acts which      are not in themselves laws, but which presuppose a 'law'      authorizing him to perform them. This law is not expressed,      either in the Constitution or in the enactments of Congress,      but reason and necessity compel that it be implied from the      exigencies of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p480"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;480&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'In none of the cases which we have mentioned, nor in the      cases cited in the extracts taken from the Neagle case, was      it possible to say that the action of the President was      directed, expressly or impliedly, by Congress. The situations      dealt with had never been covered by any act of Congress, and      there was no ground whatever for a contention that the      possibility of their occurrence had ever been specifically      considered by the legislative mind. In none of those cases      did the action of the President amount merely to the      execution of some specific law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p481"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;481&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'Neither does any of them stand apart in principle from the      case at bar, as involving the exercise of specific      constitutional powers of the President in a degree in which      this case does not involve them. Taken collectively, the      provisions of the Constitution which designate the President      as the official who must represent us in foreign relations,      in commanding the Army and Navy, in keeping Congress informed      of the state of the Union, in insuring the faithful execution      of the laws and in recommending new ones, considered in      connection with the sweeping declaration that the executive      power shall be vested in him, completely demonstrate that his      is the watchful eye, the active hand, the overseeing dynamic      force of the United States.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn49" id="fn49_ref"&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This brief is valuable not alone because of the caliber of its authors but because it lays bare in succinct reasoning the basis of the executive practice which this Court approved in the Midwest Oil case.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;483&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;During World War I, President Wilson established a War Labor Board without awaiting specific direction by Congress.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn50" id="fn50_ref"&gt;50&lt;/a&gt; With William Howard Taft and Frank P. Walsh as co-chairmen, the Board had as its purpose the prevention of strikes and lockouts interfering with the production of goods needed to meet the emergency. Effectiveness of War Labor Board decision was accomplished by Presidental action, including seizure of industrial plants.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn51" id="fn51_ref"&gt;51&lt;/a&gt; Seizure of the Nation's railroads was also ordered by President Wilson.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn52" id="fn52_ref"&gt;52&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Beginning with the Bank Holiday Proclamation&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn53" id="fn53_ref"&gt;53&lt;/a&gt; and continuing through World War II, executive leadership and intiative were characteristic of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration. In 1939, upon the outbreak of war in Europe, the President proclaimed a limited national emergency for the purpose of strengthening our national defense.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn54" id="fn54_ref"&gt;54&lt;/a&gt; By May of 1941, the danger from the Axis belligerents having become clear, the President proclaimed 'an unlimited national emergency' calling for mobilization of the Nation's defenses to repel aggression.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn55" id="fn55_ref"&gt;55&lt;/a&gt; The President took the initiative in strengthening our defenses by acquiring rights from the British Government to establish air bases in exchange for overage destroyers.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn56" id="fn56_ref"&gt;56&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In 1941, President Roosevelt acted to protect Iceland from attack by Axis powers when British forces were withdrawn by sending our forces to occupy Iceland. Congress was informed of this action on the same day that our forces reached Iceland.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn57" id="fn57_ref"&gt;57&lt;/a&gt; The occupation of Iceland was but one of 'at least 125 incidents' in our history in which Presidents, 'without Congressinal authorization, and in the absence of a declaration of war, (have) ordered the Armed Forces to take action or maintain positions abroad.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn58" id="fn58_ref"&gt;58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Some six months before Pearl Harbor, a dispute at a single aviation plant at Inglewood, California, interrupted a segment of the production of military aircraft. In spite of the comparative insignificance of this work stoppage to total defense production as contrasted with the complete paralysis now threatened by a shutdown of the entire basic steel industry, and even though our armed forces were not then engaged in combat, President Roosevelt ordered the seizure of the plant 'pursuant to the powers vested in (him) by the Constitution and laws of the United States, as President of the United States of America and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn59" id="fn59_ref"&gt;59&lt;/a&gt; The Attorney General (Jackson) vigorously proclaimed that the President had the moral duty to keep this Nation's defense effort a 'going concern.' His ringing moral justification was coupled with a legal justification equally well stated:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'The Constitution lays upon the President the duty 'to take      care that the laws be faithfully executed.' Among the laws      which he is required to find means to execute are those which      direct him to equip an enlarged army, to provide for a      strengthened navy, to protect Government property, to protect      those who are engaged in carrying out the business of the      Government, and to carry out the provisions of the Lend-Lease      Act (22 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 411 et seq.). For the faithful execution      of such laws the President has back of him not only each      general law-enforcement power conferred by the various acts      of Congress but the aggregate of all such laws plus that wide      discretion as to method vested in him by the Constitution for      the purpose of executing the laws.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;At this time, Senator Connally proposed amending the Selective Service and Training Act to authorize the President to seize any plant where an interruption of production would unduly impede the defense effort.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn61" id="fn61_ref"&gt;61&lt;/a&gt; Proponents of the measure in no way implied that the legislation would add to the powers already possessed by the President&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn62" id="fn62_ref"&gt;62&lt;/a&gt; and the amendment was opposed as unnecessary since the President already had the power.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn63" id="fn63_ref"&gt;63&lt;/a&gt; The amendment relating to plant seizures was not approved at that session of Congress.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn64" id="fn64_ref"&gt;64&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Meanwhile, and also prior to Pearl Harbor, the President ordered the seizure of a shipbuilding company and an aircraft parts plant.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn65" id="fn65_ref"&gt;65&lt;/a&gt; Following the declaration of war, but prior to the Smith-Connally Act of 1943, five additional industrial concerns were seized to avert interruption of needed production.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn66" id="fn66_ref"&gt;66&lt;/a&gt; During the same period, the President directed seizure of the Nation's coal mines to remove an obstruction to the effective prosecution of the war.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn67" id="fn67_ref"&gt;67&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="num"&gt;492&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The procedures adopted by President Roosevelt closely resembled the methods employed by President Wilson. A National War Labor Board, like its predecessor of World War I, was created by Executive Order to deal effectively and fairly with disputes affecting defense production.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn68" id="fn68_ref"&gt;68&lt;/a&gt; Seizures were considered necessary, upon disobedience of War Labor Board orders, to assure that the mobilization effort remained a 'going concern,' and to enforce the economic stabilization program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;At the time of the seizure of the coal mines, Senator Connally's bill to provide a statutory basis for seizures and for the War Labor Board was again before Congress. As stated by its sponsor, the purpose of the bill was not to augment Presidential power, but to 'let the country know that the Congress is squarely behind the President.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn69" id="fn69_ref"&gt;69&lt;/a&gt; As in the case of the legislative recognition of President Lincoln's power to seize, Congress again recognized that the President already had the necessary power, for there was no intention to 'ratify' past actions of doubtful validity. Indeed, when Senator Tydings offered an amendment to the Connally bill expressly to confirm and validate the seizure of the coal mines, sponsors of the bill opposed the amendment as casting doubt on the legality of the seizure and the amendmentwas defeated.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn70" id="fn70_ref"&gt;70&lt;/a&gt; When the Connally bill, S. 796, came befo re the House, all parts after the enacting clause were stricken and a bill introduced by Representative Smith of Virginia was substituted and passed. This action in the House is significant because the Smith bill did not contain the provisions authorizing seizure by the President but did contain provisions controlling and regulating activities in respect to properties seized by the Government under statute 'or otherwise.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn71" id="fn71_ref"&gt;71&lt;/a&gt; After a conference, the seizure provisions of the Connally bill, enacted as the Smith-Connally or War Labor Disputes Act of 1943, 57 Stat. 163, were agreed to by the House.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p494"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;494&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Following passage of the Smith-Connally Act, seizures to assure continued production on the basis of terms recommended by the War Labor Board were based upon that Act as well as upon the President's power under the Constitution and the laws generally. A question did arise as to whether the statutory language relating to 'any plant, mine, or facility equipped for the manufacture, production, or mining of any articles or materials'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn72" id="fn72_ref"&gt;72&lt;/a&gt; authorized the seizure of properties of Montgomery Ward &amp;amp; Co., a retail department store and mail order concern. The Attorney General (Biddle) issued an opinion that the President possessed the power to seize Montgomery Ward properties to prevent a work stoppage whether or not the terms of the Smith-Connally Act authorized such a seizure.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn73" id="fn73_ref"&gt;73&lt;/a&gt; This opinion was in line with the views on Presidential powers maintained by the Attorney General's predecessors (Murphy&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn74" id="fn74_ref"&gt;74&lt;/a&gt; and Jackson&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn75" id="fn75_ref"&gt;75&lt;/a&gt;) and his successor (Clark&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn76" id="fn76_ref"&gt;76&lt;/a&gt;). Accordingly, the President ordered seizure of the Chicago properties of Montgomery Ward in April, 1944, when that company refused to obey a War Labor Board order concerning the bargaining represenative of its employees in Chicago.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn77" id="fn77_ref"&gt;77&lt;/a&gt; In Congress, a Select Commitee to Investigate Seizure of the Property of Montgomery Ward &amp;amp; Co., assuming that the terms of the Smith-Connally Act did not cover this seizure, concluded that the seizure 'was not only within the Constitutional power but was the plain duty of the President.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn78" id="fn78_ref"&gt;78&lt;/a&gt; Thereafter, an election determined the bargaining representative for the Chicago employees and the properties were returned to Montgomery Ward &amp;amp; Co. In December, 1944, after continued defiance of a series of War Labor Board orders, President Roosevelt ordered the seizure of Montgomery Ward properties throughout the country.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn79" id="fn79_ref"&gt;79&lt;/a&gt; The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld this seizure on statutory grounds and also indicated its disapproval of a lower court's denial of seizure power apart from express statute.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn80" id="fn80_ref"&gt;80&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p495"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;495&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;More recently,President Truman acted to repel aggression by employing our ar med forces in Korea.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn81" id="fn81_ref"&gt;81&lt;/a&gt; Upon the intervention of the Chinese Communists, the President proclaimed the existence of an unlimited national emergency requiring the speedy build-up of our defense establishment.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn82" id="fn82_ref"&gt;82&lt;/a&gt; Congress responded by providing for increased manpower and weapons for our own armed forces, by increasing military aid under the Mutual Security Program and by enacting economic stabilization measures, as previously described.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p496"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;496&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;This is but a cursory summary of executive leadership. But it amply demonstrates that Presidents have taken prompt action to enforce the laws and protect the country whether or not Congress happened to provide in advance for the particular method of execution. At the minimum, the executive actions reviewed herein sustain the action of the President in this case. And many of the cited examples of Presidential practice go far beyond the extent of power necessary to sustain the President's order to seize the steel mills. The fact that temporary executive seizures of industrial plants to meet an emergency have not been directly tested in this Court furnishes not the slightest suggestion that such actions have been illegal. Rather, the fact that Congress and the courts have consistently recognized and given their support to such executive action indicates that such a power of seizure has been accepted throughout our history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p497"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;497&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;History bears out the genius of the Founding Fathers, who created a Government subject to law but not left subject to inertia when vigor and initiative are required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class="center"&gt;IV.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p498"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;498&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Focusing now on the situation confronting the President on the night of April 8, 1952, we cannot but conclude that the President was performing his duty under the Constitution to 'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed'&amp;#8212;a duty described by President Benjamin Harrison as 'the central idea of the office.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn83" id="fn83_ref"&gt;83&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p499"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;499&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The President reported to Congress the morning after the seizure that he acted because a work stoppage in steel production would immediately imperil the safety of the Nation by preventing execution of the legislative programs for procurement of military equipment. And, while a shutdown could be averted by granting the price concessions requested by plaintiffs, granting such concessions would disrupt the price stabilization program also enacted by Congress. Rather than fail to execute either legislative program, the President acted to execute both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p500"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Much of the argument in this case has been directed at straw men. We do not now have before us the case of a President acting solely on the basis of his own notions of the public welfare. Nor is there any question of unlimited executive power in this case. The President himself closed the door to any such claim when he sent his Message to Congress stating his purpose to abide by any action of Congress, whether approving or disapproving his seizure action. Here, the President immediately made sure that Congress was fully informed of the temporary action he had taken only to preserve the legislative programs from destruction until Congress could act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p501"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;501&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The absence of a specific statute authorizing seizure of the steel mills as a mode of executing the laws&amp;#8212;both the military procurement program and the anti-inflation program&amp;#8212;has not until today been thought to prevent the President from executing the laws. Unlike an administrative commission confined to the enforcement of the statute under which it was created, or the head to a department when administering a particular statute, the President is a constitutional officer charged with taking care that a 'mass of legislation' be executed. Flexibility as to mode of execution to meet critical situations is a matter of practical necessity. This practical construction of the 'Take Care' clause, adocated by John Marshall, was adopted by this Court in In re Neagle, In re Debs and other cases cited supra. See also Ex parte Quirin, 1942, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/6zny/ex-parte-quirin/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;317&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 26, 63 S.Ct. 2, 10, 87 L.Ed. 3. Although more restrictive views of executive power, advocated in dissenting opinions of Justices Holmes, McReynolds and Brandeis, were emphatically rejected by this Court in Myers v. United States, supra, members of today's majority treat these dissenting views as authoritative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p502"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;502&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;There is no statute prohibiting seizure as a method of enforcing legislative programs. Congress has in no wise indicated that its legislation is not to be executed by the taking of private property (subject of course to the payment of just compensation) if its legislation cannot otherwise be executed. Indeed, the Universal Military Training and Service Act authorizes the seizure of any plant that fails to fill a Government contract&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn84" id="fn84_ref"&gt;84&lt;/a&gt; or the properties of any steel producer that fails to allocate steel as directed for defense production.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn85" id="fn85_ref"&gt;85&lt;/a&gt; And the Defense Production Act authorizes the President to requisition equipment and condemn real property needed without delay in the defense effort.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn86" id="fn86_ref"&gt;86&lt;/a&gt; Where Congress authorizes seizure in instances not necessarily crucial to the defense program, it can hardly be said to have disclosed an intention to prohibit seizures where essential to the execution of that legislative program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p503"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;503&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Whatever the extent of Presidential power on more tranquil occasions, and whatever the right of the President to execute legislative programs as he sees fit without reporting the mode of execution to Congress, the single Presidential purpose disclosed on this record is to faithfully execute the laws by acting in an emergency to maintain the status quo, thereby preventing collapse of the legislative programs until Congress could act. The President's action served the same purposes as a judicial stay entered to maintain the status quo in order to preserve the jurisdiction of a court. In his Message to Congress immediately following the seizure, the President explained the necessity of his action in executing the military procurement and anti-inflation legislative programs and expressed his desire to cooperate with any legislative proposals approving, regulating or rejecting the seizure of the steel mills. Consequently, there is no evidence whatever of any Presidential purpose to defy Congress or act in any way inconsistent with the legislative will.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p504"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;504&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In United States v. Midwest Oil Co., supra, this Court approved executive action where, as here, the President acted to preserve an important matter until Congress could act&amp;#8212;even though his action in that case was contrary to an express statute. In this case, there is no statute prohibiting the action taken by the President in a matter not merely important but threatening the very safety of the Nation. Executive inaction in such a situation, courting national disaster, is foreign to the concept of energy and initiative in the Executive as created by the Founding Fathers. The Constitution was itself 'adopted in a period of grave emergency. * * * While emergency does not create power, emergency may furnish the occasion for the exercise of power.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn87" id="fn87_ref"&gt;87&lt;/a&gt; The Framers knew, as we should know in these times of peril, that there is real danger in Executive weakness. There is no cause to fear Executive tyranny so long as the laws of Congress are being faithfully executed. Certainly there is no basis for fear of dictatorship when the Executive acts, as he did in this case, only to save the situation until Congress could act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p505"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;505&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Plaintiffs place their primary emphasis on the Labor M anagement Relations Act of 1947, hereinafter referred to as the Taft-Hartley Act, but do not contend that that Act contains any provision prohibiting seizure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p506"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;506&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Under the Taft-Hartley Act, as under the Wagner Act, collective bargaining and the right to strike are at the heart of our national labor policy. Taft-Hartley preserves the right to strike in any emergency, however serious, subject only to an 80-day delay in cases of strikes imperiling the national health and safety.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn88" id="fn88_ref"&gt;88&lt;/a&gt; In such a case, the President may appoint a board of inquiry to report the facts of the labor dispute. Upon receiving that report, the President may direct the Attorney General to petition a District Court to enjoin the strike. If the injunction is granted, it may continue in effect for no more than 80 days, during which time the board of inquiry makes further report and efforts are made to settle the dispute. When the injunction is dissolved, the President is directed to submit a report to Congress together with his recommendations.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn89" id="fn89_ref"&gt;89&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p507"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;507&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Enacted after World War II, Taft-Hartley restricts the right to strike against private employers only to a limited extent and for the sole purpose of affording an additional period of time within which to settle the dispute. Taft-Hartley in no way curbs strikes before an injunction can be obtained and after an 80-day injunction is dissolved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p508"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;508&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Plaintiffs admit that the emergency procedures of Taft-Hartley are not mandatory. Nevertheless, plaintiffs apparently argue that, since Congress did provide the 80-day injunction method for dealing with emergency strikes, the President cannot claim that an emergency exists until the procedures of Taft-Hartley have been exhausted. This argument was not the basis of the District Court's opinion and, whatever merit the argument might have had following the enactment of Taft-Hartley, it loses all force when viewed in light of the statutory pattern confronting the President in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p509"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;509&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;In Title V of the Defense Production Act of 1950,&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn90" id="fn90_ref"&gt;90&lt;/a&gt; Congress stated:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p510"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;510&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;'It is the intent of Congress, in order to provide for      effective price and wage stabilization pursuant to title IV      of this Act and to maintain uninterrupted production, that      there be effective procedures for the settlement of labor      disputes affecting national defense.' &amp;#167; 501.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p511"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;511&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Title V authorized the President to initiate labor-management conferences and to take action appropriate to carrying out the recommendations of such conferences and the provisions of Title V. &amp;#167; 502. Due regard is to be given to collective bargaining practice and stabilization policies and no action taken is to be inconsistent with Taft-Hartley and other laws. &amp;#167; 503. The purpose of these provisions was to authorize the President 'to establish a board, commission or other agency, similar to the War Labor Board of World War II, to carry out the title.'&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn91" id="fn91_ref"&gt;91&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p512"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;512&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The President authorized the Wage Stabilization Board (WSB), which administers the wage stabilization functions of Title IV of the Defense Production Act, also to deal with labor disputes affecting the defense program.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn92" id="fn92_ref"&gt;92&lt;/a&gt; When extension of the Defense Production Act was before Congress in 1951, the Chairman of the Wage Stabilization Board described in detail the relationship between the Taft-Hartley procedures applicable to labor disputes imperiling the national health and safety and the new WSB dispute procedures especially devised for settlement of labor disputes growing out of the needs of the defense prgram.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn93" id="fn93_ref"&gt;93&lt;/a&gt; Aware that a technique separate from Taft-Hartley  had been devised, members of Congress attempted to divest the WSB of its disputes powers. These attempts were defeated in the House, were not brought to a vote in the Senate and the Defense Production Act was extended through June 30, 1952, without change in the disputes powers of the WSB.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn94" id="fn94_ref"&gt;94&lt;/a&gt; Certainly this legislative creation of a new procedure for dealing with defense disputes negatives any notion that Congress intended the earlier and discretionary Taft-Hartley procedure to be an exclusive procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p513"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;513&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Accordingly, as of December 22, 1951, the President had a choice between alternate procedures for settling the threatened strike in the steel mills: one route created to deal with peacetime disputes; the other route specially created to deal with disputes growing out of the defense and stabilization program. There is no question of by-passing a statutory procedure because both of the routes available to the President in December were based upon statutory authorization. Both routes were available in the steel dispute. The Union, by refusing to abide by the defense and stabilization program, could have forced the President to invoke Taft-Hartley at that time to delay the strike a maximum of 80 days. Instead, the Union agreed to cooperate with the defense program and submit the dispute to the Wage Stabilization Board.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p514"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;514&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Plaintiffs had no objection whatever at that time to the President's choice of the WSB route. As a result, the strike was postponed, a WSB panel held hearings and reported the position of the parties and the WSB recommended the terms of a settlement which it found were fair and equitable. Moreover, the WSB performed a function which the board of inquiry contemplated by Taft-Hartley could not have accomplished when it checked the recommended wage settlement against its own wage stabilization regulations issued pursuant to its stabilization functions under Title IV of the Defense Production Act. Thereafter, the parties bargained on the basis of the WSB recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p515"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;515&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;When the President acted on April 8, he had exhausted the procedures for settlement available to him. Taft-Hartley was a route parallel to, not connected with, the WSB procedure. The strike had been delayed 99 days as contrasted with the maximum delay of 80 days under Taft-Hartley. There had been a hearing on the issues in dispute and bargaining which promised settlement up to the very hour before seizure had broken down. Faced with immediate national peril through stoppage in steel production on the one hand and faced with destruction of the wage and price legislative programs on the other, the President took temporary possession of the steel mills as the only course open to him consistent with his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p516"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;516&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Plaintiffs' property was taken and placed in the possession of the Secretary of Commerce to prevent any interruption in steel production. It made no difference whether the stoppage was caused by a union-management dispute over terms and conditions of employmnt, a union-Government dispute over wage stabilization or a management-Government dispute over price stabilization. The President's action has thus far been effective, not in settling the dispute, but in saving the various legislative programs at stake from destruction until Congress could act in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p517"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;517&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The diversity of views expressed in the six opinions of the majority, the lack of reference to authoritative precedent, the repeated reliance upon prior dissenting opinions, the complete disregard of the uncontroverted facts showing the gravity of the emergency and the temporary nature of the taking all serve to demonstrate how far afield one must go to affirm the order of the District Court.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p518"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;518&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The broad executive power granted by Article II to an officer on duty 365 days a year cannot, it is said, be invoked to avert disaster. Instead, the President must confine himself to sending a message to Congress recommending action. Under this messenger-boy concept of the Office, the President cannot even act to preserve legislative programs from destruction so that Congress will have something left to act upon. There is no judicial finding that the executive action was unwarranted because there was in fact no basis for the President's finding of the existence of an emergency&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn95" id="fn95_ref"&gt;95&lt;/a&gt; for, under this view, the gravity of the emergency and the immediacy of the threatened disaster are considered irrelevant as a matter of law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p519"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;519&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Seizure of plaintiffs' property is not a pleasant undertaking. Similarly unpleasant to a free country are the draft which disrupts the home and military procurement which causes economic dislocation and compels adoption of price controls, wage stabilization and allocation of materials. The President informed Congress that even a temporary Government operation of plaintiffs' properties was 'thoroughly distasteful' to him, but was necessary to prevent immediate paralysis of the mobilization program. Presidents have been in the past, and any man worthy of the Office should be in the future, free to take at least interim action necessary to execute legislative programs essential to survival of the Nation. A sturdy judiciary should not be swayed by the unpleasantness or unpopularity of necessary executive action, but must independently determine for itself whether the President was acting, as required by the Constitution, to 'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p520"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;520&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;As the District Judge stated, this is no time for 'timorous' judicial action. But neither is this a time for timorous executive action. Faced with the duty of executing the defense programs which Congress had enacted and the disastrous effects that any stoppage in steel production would have on those programs, the President acted to preserve those programs by seizing the steel mills. There is no question that the possession was other than temporary in character and subject to congressional direction&amp;#8212;either approving, disapproving or regulating the manner in which the mills were to be administered and returned to the owners. The President immediately informed Congress of his action and clearly stated his intention to abide by the legislative will. No basis for claims of arbitrary action, unlimited powers or dictatorial usurpation of congressional power appears from the facts of this case. On the contrary, judicial, legislative and executive precedents throughout our history demonstrate that in this case the President acted in full conformity with his duties under the Constitution. Accordingly, we would reverse the order of the District Court.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; The power to seize plants under the War Labor Disputes Act ended with the termination of hostilities, proclaimed on Dec. 31, 1946, prior to the incoming of the Eightieth Congress; and the power to operate previously seized plants ended on June 30, 1947, only a week after the enactment of the Labor Management Relations Act over the President's veto. 57 Stat. 163, 165, 50 U.S.C.App. (1946 ed.) &amp;#167; 1503, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, &amp;#167; 1503.

        &lt;p&gt; Some of the more directly relevant statements are the following: 'In most instances the force of public opinion should make itself sufficiently felt in this 80-day period to bring about a peaceful termination of the controversy. Should this expectation fail, the bill provides for the President laying the matter before Congress for whatever legislation seems necessary to preserve the health and safety of the Nation in the crisis.' Senate Report No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 15.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'We believe it would be most unwise for the Congress to attempt to adopt laws relating to any single dispute between private parties.' Senate Minority Report, id., Part 2, at 17.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the debates Senator H. Alexander Smith, a member of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, said, 'In the event of a deadlock and a strike is not ended, the matter is referred to the President, who can use his discretion as to whether he will present the matter to the Congress, whether or not the situation is such that emergency legislation is required.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Nothing has been done with respect to the Smith-Connally Act. There is no provision for taking over property or running plants by the Government. We simply provide a procedure which we hope will be effective in 99 out of 100 cases where the health or safety of the people may be affected, and still leave a loophole for congressional action.' 93 Cong.Rec. 4281.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The President in his veto message said, '* * * it would be mandatory for the President to transfer the whole problem to the Congress, even if it were not in session. Thus, major economic disputes between employers and their workers over contract terms might ultimately be thrown into the political arena for disposition. One could scarcely devise a less effective method for discouraging critical strikes.' 93 Cong.Rec. 7487.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; Senator Taft said:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'If there finally develops a complete national emergency threatening the safety and health of the people of the United States, Congress can pass an emergency law to cover the particular emergency. * * *&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'We have felt that perhaps in the case of a general strike, or in the case of other serious strikes after the termination of every possible effort to resolve the dispute, the remedy might be an emergency act by Congress for that particular purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'* * * But while such a bill (For seizure of plants and union funds) might be prepared, I should be unwilling to place such a law on the books until we actually face such an emergency, and Congress applies the remedy for the particular emergency only. Eighty days will provide plenty of time within which to consider the possibility of what should be done; and we believe very strongly that there should not be anything in this law which prohibits finally the right to strike.' 93 Cong.Rec. 3835&amp;#8212;3836.&lt;/p&gt;

Central to that Act, of course, was the temporary grant of the seizure power to the President. Mr. Carey then said:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Senator Burton. If this would continue forever it might mean the nationalization of industry?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Carey. Let us consider it on a temporary basis. How is the law borne by labor? Here is the Government-sponsored strike breaking agency, and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Our suggestion of a voluntary agreement of the representatives of industry and labor and Government, participating in calling a conference, is a democratic way. The other one is the imposition of force, the other is the imposition of seizure of certain things for a temporary period; the destruction of collective bargaining, and it would break down labor relations that may have been built up over a long period.'&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; The provision of &amp;#167; 502 in S. 3936, as reported by the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, read as follows: 'The President is authorized, after consultation with labor and management, to establish such principles and procedures and to take such action as he deems appropriate for the settlement of labor disputes affecting national defense, including the designation of such persons, boards or commissions as he may deem appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.' That language was superseded in the Conference Report by the language that was finally enacted. H.R.Rep. No. 3042, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 16, 35. The change made by the Conference Committee was for the purpose of emphasizing the voluntary nature of the cooperation sought from the public, labor, and management; as Senator Ives explained under repeated questioning, 'If any group were to hold out, there would be no agreement (on action to carry out the provisions of this title).' 96 Cong.Rec. 14071&amp;#8212;14072. Chairman Maybank of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency said, 'The labor disputes title of the Senate was accepted by the House with amendment which merely indicates more specific avenues through which the President may bring labor and management together.'

        &lt;p&gt; S.Rep. No. 2250, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 41; H.R.Rep. No. 3042, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 35. It is hardly necessary to note that Congressional authorization of an agency similar to the War Labor Board does not imply a Congressional grant of seizure power similar to that given the President specifically by &amp;#167; 3 of the War Labor Disputes Act of 1943. The War Labor Board, created by &amp;#167; 7 of the 1943 Act, had only administrative sanctions. See 57 Stat. 163, 166&amp;#8212;167; see Report of Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, The Disputes Functions of the Wage Stabilization Board, 1951, S.Rep. No. 1037, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. 6. The seizure power given by Congress in &amp;#167; 3 of the 1943 Act was given to the President, not to the War Labor Board, and was needed only when the War Labor Board reported it had failed; the seizure power was separate and apart from the War Labor Board machinery for settling disputes. At most the Defense Production Act does what &amp;#167; 7 of the War Labor Disputes Act did; the omission of any grant of seizure power similar to &amp;#167; 3 is too obvious not to have been conscious. At any rate, the Wage Stabilization Board differs substantially from the earlier War Labor Board. In 1951 the Senate Committee studying the disputes functions of the Wage Stabilization Board pointed out the substantial differences between that Board and its predecessor and concluded that 'The New Wage Stabilization Board * * * does not rely on title V of the Defense Production Act for its authority.' S.Rep.No. 1037, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., supra, at 4&amp;#8212;6.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;'In fact, the courts have upheld the constitutionality of the national emergency provisions of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, which can require that workers stay on the job for at least 80 days when a strike would seriously threaten the national health and safety in peacetime.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'By the terms of the pending bill, the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 would be controlling in matters affecting the relationship between labor and management, including collective bargaining. It seems to me, however, that this is as far as we should go in legislation of this type.'&lt;/p&gt;

(May 17&amp;#8212;June 7, 1951). The resulting Report of the Senate Committee, S.Rep. No. 1037, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. 9, recommended that 'Title V of the Defense Production Act be retained' and that 'No statutory limitations be imposed on the President's authority to deal with disputes through voluntary machinery; such limitations, we believe, would infringe on the President's constitutional power.' (Emphasis added.) The Committee found, id., at 10, that the 'Wage Stabilization Board relies completely on voluntary means for settling disputes and is, therefore, an extension of free collective bargaining. The Board has no powers of legal compulsion.' 'Executive Order No. 10233,' the Committee found further, 'does not in any way run counter to the * * * Taft-Hartley Act. It is simply an additional tool, not a substitute for these laws.' Of particular relevance to the present case, the Committee declared:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'The recommendations of the Wage Stabilization Board in disputes certified by the President have no compulsive force. The parties are free to disregard recommendations of the Wage Stabilization Board * * *.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'There is, of course, the President's authority to seize plants under the Selective Service Act (a power not here used), but this is an authority which exists independently of the Wage Stabilization Board and its disputes-handling functions. In any case, seizure is an extraordinary remedy, and the authority to seize, operates whether or not there is a disputes-handling machinery.' Id., at 5.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; One of President Wilson's seizures has given rise to controversy. In his testimony in justification of the Montgomery Ward seizure during World War II, Attorney General Biddle argued that the World War I seizure of Smith &amp;amp; Wesson could not be supported under any of the World War I statutes authorizing seizure. He thus adduced it in support of the claim of so-called inherent presidential power of seizure. See Hearings before House Select Committee to Investigate the Seizure of Montgomery Ward, 78th Cong., 2d Sess. 167&amp;#8212;168. In so doing, he followed the ardor of advocates in claiming everything. In his own opinion to the President, he rested the power to seize Montgomery Ward on the statutory authority of the War Labor Disputes Act, see 40 Ops. Att'y Gen. 312 (1944), and the Court of Appeals decision upholding the Montgomery Ward seizure confined itself to that ground. United States v. Montgomery Ward &amp;amp; Co., 7 Cir., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/ca7/8AMa/united-states-v-montgomery-ward-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;150&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;F.2d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;369&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. What Attorney General Biddle said about Smith &amp;amp; Wesson was, of course, post litem motam. Whether or not the World War I statutes were broad enough to justify that seizure, it is clear that the taking officers conceived themselves as moving within the scope of statute law. See n. 3, Appendix II, infra. Thus, whether or not that seizure was within the statute, it cannot properly be cited as a precedent for the one before us. On this general subject, compare Attorney General Knox's opinion advising President Theodore Roosevelt against the so-called 'stewardship' theory of the Presidency. National Archives, Opinions of the Attorney General, Book 31, Oct. 10, 1902 (R.G. 60); Theodore Roosevelt, Autobiography, 388&amp;#8212;389; 3 Morison, The Letters of Theodore Roosevelt, 323&amp;#8212;366.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; What a President may do as a matter of expediency or extremity may never reach a definitive consitutional decision. For example, President Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus, claiming the constitutional right to do so. See Ex part Merryman, 17 Fed.Cas.No.9,487.

        &lt;p&gt; Mr. Justice Brandeis, speaking for the Court in United States v. North American Transportation &amp;amp; Trading Co., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/vBy/united-states-v-north-american-transp-trading-co/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;253&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;330&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 333, 40 S.Ct. 518, 520, 64 L.Ed. 935, stated that the basis of the Government's liability for a taking of property was legislative authority, 'In order that the Government shall be liable to must appear that the officer who has physically taken possession of the property was duly authorized so to do, either directly by Congress or by the official upon whom Congress conferred the power.'&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That theory explains cases like United States v. Causby, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x1h/united-states-v-causby/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;328&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 66 S.Ct. 1062, 90 L.Ed. 1206, where the acts of the officials resulting in a taking were acts authorized by the Congress, though the Congress had not treated the acts us one of appropriation of private property.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; It is in this class of cases that we find the broadest recent statements of presidential power, including those relied on here. United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wx9/united-states-v-curtiss-wright-export-corp/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;299&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;304&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 57 S.Ct. 216, 221, 81 L.Ed. 255, involved, not the question of the President's power to act without congressional au-&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;thority, but the question of his right to act under and in accord with an Act of Congress. The constitutionality of the Act under which the President had proceeded was assailed on the ground that it delegated legislative powers to the President. Much of the Court's opinion is dictum, but the ratio decidendi is contained in the following language:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'When the President is to be authorized by legislation to act in respect of a matter intended to affect a situation in foreign territory, the legislator properly bears in mind the important consideration that the form of the President's action&amp;#8212;or, indeed, whether he shall act at all&amp;#8212;may well depend, among other things, upon the nature of the confidential information which he has or may thereafter receive, or upon the effect which his action may have upon our foreign relations. This consideration, in connection with what we have already said on the subject, discloses the unwisdom of requiring Congress in this field of governmental power to lay down narrowly definite standards by which the President is to be governed. As this court said in Mackenzie v. Hare, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/viD/mackenzie-v-hare/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;239&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;299&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 311, 36 S.Ct. 106, 108, 60 L.Ed. 297, 'As a government, the United States is invested with all the attributes of sovereignty. As it has the character of nationality it has the powers of nationality, especially those which concern its relations and intercourse with other countries. We should hesitate long before limiting or embarrasing such powers.' (Italics supplied.)'&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That case does not solve the present controversy. It recognized internal and external affairs as being in separate categories, and held that the strict limitation upon congressional delegations of power to the President over internal affairs does not apply with respect to delegations of power in external affairs. It was intimated that the President might act in external affairs without congressional authority, but not that he might act contrary to an Act of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; The oft-cited Louisiana Purchase had nothing to do with the separation of powers as between the President and Congress, but only with state and federal power. The Louisiana Purchase was subject to rather academic criticism, not upon the ground that Mr. Jefferson acted without authority from Congress, but that neither had express authority to expand the boundaries of the United States by purchase or annexation. Mr. Jefferson himself had strongly opposed the doctrine that the State's delegation of powers to the Federal Government could be enlarged by resort to implied powers. Afterwards in a letter to John Breckenridge, dated August 12, 1803, he declared:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'The Constitution has made no provision for our holding foreign territory, still less for incorporating foreign nations into our Union. The executive in seizing the fugitive occurrence which so much advances the good of their country, have done an act beyond the Constitution. The Legislature is casting behind them metaphysical subtleties, and risking themselves like faithful servants, must ratify and pay for it, and throw themselves on their country for doing for them unauthorized, what we know they would have done for themselves had they been in a situation to do it.' 10 The Writings of Thomas Jefferson 407.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; How widely this doctrine espoused by the President's counsel departs from the early view of presidential power is shown by a comparison. President Jefferson, without authority from Congress, sent the American Fleet into the Mediterranean, where it engaged in a naval battle with the Tripolitan fleet. He sent a message to Congress on December 8, 1801, in which he said:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Tripoli, the least considerable of the Barbary States, had come forward with demands unfounded either in right or in compact, and had permitted itself to denounce war on our failure to comply before a given day. The style of the demand admitted but one answer. I sent a small squadron of frigates into the Mediterranean * * * with orders to protect our commerce against the threatened attack. * * * Our commerce in the Mediterranean was blockaded, and that of the Atlantic in peril. * * * One of the Tripolitan cruisers having fallen in with, and engaged the small schooner Enterprise, * * * was captured, after a heavy slaughter of her men * * *. Unauthorized by the constitution, without the sanction of Congress, to go beyond the line of defence, the vessel being disabled from committing further hostilities, was liberated with its crew. The legislature will doubltless consider whether, by authorizing measures of offence, also, they will place our force on an equal footing with that of its adversaries. I communicate all material information on this subject, that in the exercise of the important function confided by the constitution to the legislature exclusively, their judgment may form itself on a knowledge and consideration of every circumstance of weight.'

        &lt;p&gt; In 1940, President Roosevelt proposed to transfer to Great Britain certain overage destroyers and small patrol boats then under construction. He did not presume to rely upon any claim of constitutional power as Commander-in-Chief. On the contrary, he was advised that such destroyers&amp;#8212;if certified not to be essential to the defense of the United States&amp;#8212;could be 'transferred, exchanged, sold, or otherwise disposed of,' because Congress had so authorized him. Accordingly, the destroyers were exchanged for air bases. In the same opinion, he was advised that Congress had prohibited the release or transfer of the so-called 'mosquito boats' then under construction, so those boats were not transferred.

        &lt;p&gt; President Wilson, just before our entrance into World War I, went before the Congress and asked its approval of his decision to authorize merchant ships to carry defensive weapons. He said:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'No doubt I already possess that authority without special warrant of law, by the plain implication of my constitutional duties and powers; but I prefer in the present circumstances not to act upon general implication. I wish to feel that the authority and the power of the Congress are behind me in whatever it may become necessary for me to do. We are jointly the servants of the people and must act together and in their spirit, so far as we can divine and interpret it.' XVII Richardson, op.cit., 8211.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When our Government was itself in need of shipping whilst ships flying the flags of nations overrun by Hitler, as well as belligerent merchantmen, were immobilized in American harbors where they had taken refuge, President Roosevelt did not assume that it was in his power to seize such foreign vessels to make up our own deficit. He informed Congress: 'I am satisfied, after consultation with the heads of the interested departments and agencies,&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;that we should have statutory authority to take over such vessels as our needs require. * * *' 87 Cong.Rec. 3072 (77th Cong., 1st Sess.); The Public Papers and Addresses of Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1941 (Rosenman), 94. The necessary statutory authority was shortly forthcoming. 55 Stat. 242.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In his first inaugural address President Roosevelt pointed out two courses to obtain legislative remedies, one being to enact measures he was prepared to recommend, the other to enact measures 'the Congress may build out of its experience and wisdom.' He continued, 'But in the event that the Congress shall fail to take and of these two courses, and in the event that the national emergency is still critical, I shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me. I shall ask the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis&amp;#8212;broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.' (Emphasis supplied.) The Public Papers and Adresses of Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1933 (Rosenman), 15.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On March 6, 1933, 48 Stat. 1689, President Roosevelt proclaimed the Bank Holiday. The Proclamation did not invoke constitutional powers of the Executive but expressly and solely relied upon the Act of Congress of October 6, 1917, 40 Stat. 411, &amp;#167; 5(b), as amended, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, &amp;#167; 5(b). He relied steadily on legislation to empower him to deal with economic emergency. The Public Papers and Addresses of Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1933 (Rosenman), 24.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It is interesting to note Holdsworth's comment on the powers of legislation by proclamation when in the hands of the Tudors. 'The extent to which they could be legally used was never finally settled in this century, because the Tudors made so tactful a use of their powers that no demand for the settlement of this question was raised.' 4 Holdsworth, History of English Law, 104.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; The North American Aviation Company was under direct and binding contracts to supply defense items to the Government. No such contracts are claimed to exist here. Seizure of plants which refused to comply with Government orders had been expressly authorized by Congress in &amp;#167; 9 of the Selective Service Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 885, 892, so that the seizure of the North American plant was entirely consistent with congressional policy. The company might have objected on technical grounds to the seizure, but it was taken over with acquiescence, amounting to all but consent, of the owners who had admitted that the situation was beyond their control. The strike involved in the North American case was in violation of the union's collective agreement and the national labor leaders approved the seizure to end the strike. It was described as in the nature of an insurrection, a Communist-led political strike against the Government's lend-lease policy. Here we have only a loyal, lawful, but regrettable economic disagreement between management and labor. The North American plant contained government-owned machinery, material and goods in the process of production to which workmen were forcibly denied access by picketing strikers. Here no Government property is protected by the seizure. See New York Times of June 10, 1941, pp. 1, 14 and 16, for substantially accurate account of the proceedings and the conditions of violence at the North American plant.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The North American seizure was regarded as an execution of congressional policy. I do not regard it as a precedent for this, but, even if I did, I should not bind present judicial judgment by earlier partisan advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Statements from a letter by the Attorney General to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, dated February 2, 1949, with reference to pending labor legislation, while not cited by any of the parties here are sometimes quoted as being in support of the 'inherent' powers of the President. The proposed bill contained a mandatory provision that during certain investigations the disputants in a labor dispute should continue operations under the terms and conditions of employment existing prior to the beginning of the dispute. It made no provision as to how continuance should be enforced and specified no penalty for disobedience. The Attorney General advised that in appropriate circumstances the United States would have access to the courts to protect the national health, safety and welfare. This was the rule laid down by this Court in Texas &amp;amp; N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Steamship Clerks, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/wcy/texas-nor-co-v-brotherhood-of-ry-steamship-clerks/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;281&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;548&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 50 S.Ct. 427, 74 L.Ed. 1034. The Attorney General observed:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'However, with regard to the question of the power of the Government under Title III, I might point out that the inherent power of the President to deal with emergencies that affect the health, safety and welfare of the entire Nation is exceedingly great. See Opinion of Attorney General Murphy of October 4, 1939, 39 Op.A.G. 344, 347; United States v. United Mine Workers of America, 1947, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/x2K/united-states-v-mine-workers/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;330&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;258&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884.'&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'Regardless of the general reference to 'inherent powers,' the citations were instances of congressional authorization. I do not suppose it is open to doubt that power to see that the laws are faithfully executed was ample basis for the specific advice given by the Attorney General in this letter.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt; The Chairman of the Senate Committee sponsoring the bill said in the Senate:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'We did not feel that we should put into the law, as a part of the collectivebargaining machinery, an ultimate resort to compulsory arbitration, or to seizure, or to any other action. We feel that it would interfere with the whole process of collective bargaining. If such a remedy is available as a routine remedy, there will always be pressure to resort to it by whichever party thinks it will receive better treatment through such a process than it would receive in collective bargaining, and it will back out of collective bargaining. It will not make a bona-fide attempt to settle if it thinks it will receive a better deal under the final arbitration which may be provided.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'We have felt that perhaps in the case of a general strike, or in the case of other serious strikes, after the termination of every possible effort to resolve the dispute, the remedy might be an emergency act by Congress for that particular purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'I have had in mind drafting such a bill, giving power to seize the plants, and other necessary facilities, to seize the unions, their money, and their treasury, and requisition trucks and other equipment; in fact, to do everything that the British did in their general strike of 1926. But while such a bill might be prepared, I should be unwilling to place such a law on the books until we actually face such an emergency, and Congress applies the remedy for the particular emergency only. Eighty days will provide plenty of time within which to consider the possibility of what should be done; and we believe very strongly that there should not be anything in this law which prohibits finally the right to strike.' 93 Cong.Rec. 3835&amp;#8212;3836.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;'(a) Whenever the President after consultation with and receiving advice from the National Security Resources Board determines that it is in the interest of the national security for the Government to obtain prompt delivery of any articles or materials the procurement of which has been authorized by the Congress exclusively for the use of the armed forces of the United States, or for the use of the Atomic Energy Commission, he is authorized, through the head of any Government agency, to place with any person operating a plant, mine, or other facility capable of producing such articles or materials an order for such quantity of such articles or materials as the President deems appropriate. Any person with whom an order is placed pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be advised that such order is placed pursuant to the provisions of this section.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;'(2) to fill such order within the period of time prescribed by the President or as soon thereafter as possible as determined by the President;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'(3) to produce the kind or quality of articles or materials ordered; or&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;'(4) to furnish the quantity, kind, and quality of articles or materials ordered at such price as shall be negotiated between such person and the Government agency concerned; or in the event of failure to negotiate a price, to furnish the quantity, kind, and quality of articles or materials ordered at such price as he may subsequently be determined to be entitled to receive under subsection (d); the President is authorized to take immediate possession of any plant, mine, or other facility of such person and to operate it, through any Government agency, for the production of such articles or materials as may be required by the Government.' 62 Stat. 625, 50 U.S.C.App. (Supp. IV) &amp;#167; 468, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, &amp;#167; 468.

        &lt;p&gt; The Government has offered no explanation, in the record, the briefs, or the oral argument, as to why it could not have made both a literal and timely compliance with the provisions of that Act. Apparently the Government could have placed orders with the steel companies for the various types of steel needed for defense purposes, and instructed the steel companies to ship the mate riel directly to producers of planes, tanks, and munitions. The Act does not require that government orders cover the entire capacity of a producer's plant before the President has power to seize.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Our experience during World War I demonstrates the speed with which the Government can invoke the remedy of seizing plants which fail to fill compulsory orders. The Federal Enameling &amp;amp; Stamping Co., of McKees Rocks, Pa., was served with a compulsory order on September 13, 1918, and seized on the same day. The Smith &amp;amp; Wesson plant at Springfield, Mass., was seized on September 13, 1918, after the company had failed to make deliveries under a compulsory order issued the preceding week.
