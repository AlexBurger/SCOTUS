The parties have concluded that it is in the best interest of each of them to avoid litigation and multiple exercises of sovereignty and jurisdiction, encourage the optimum beneficial use of the river, its facilities and its waters, and remove all causes of controversy between said parties with respect to the location of the boundary between the States and, therefore, to settle and to terminate this dispute by agreement and compromise and submission of the boundary between the State of South Dakota and the State of Nebraska with respect to Rush Island in the future to a Joint State Boundary Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

The States of Nebraska and South Dakota have agreed to submit the determination of future boundary changes with regard to "Elk/Rush Island" but not to the title to the premises therein, to a Joint State Boundary Commission appointed by the elected officials of these respective States for the Commission's determination from the date of that determination forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that pursuant to the above Stipulations and Findings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. That the land known as "Elk/Rush Island," the subject of this litigation, be and the same is within the boundary of the State of Nebraska, and subject to its jurisdiction;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. That the State of South Dakota hereby cedes to the Intervenors any right or title it may have to the subject property known as "Elk/Rush Island" as more fully described in Appendix A attached hereto;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. That the States of Nebraska and South Dakota will submit the determination of the future boundary changes, if any, with regard to "Elk/Rush Island," but not to the title of the premises thereto, to a Joint State Boundary Commission appointed by the elected officials of these respective States for the Commission's determination from the date of that determination forth;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. That the State of South Dakota and the State of Nebraska will proceed to effectuate any and all other requirements agreed to in the Stipulation to the extent that conditions and circumstances permit; and&lt;/p&gt;
