In so surveying, running, and platting such medial line the commissioners shall conform to the fifth paragraph of the decree entered herein March 12, 1923, entitled 'Supplement to partial decree of June 5, 1922,' and shall ascertain and show on such plat the exact location of all oil wells which are within 300 feet of such medial line. The commissioners shall make a separate report of their action under this order, and shall include therein a statement of the time employed and the expenses incurred in that work. The work and report of the commissioners hereunder shall be subject to the approval of the court. Copies of the report shall be promptly delivered to the two States and the United States, and exceptions or objections thereto, if there be such, on the part of either State, the United States, or any private intervener herein, shall be presented to the court or, if it be not in session, filed with the clerk within 40 days after the report is made. The cost of executing this order shall be borne and paid as part of the expenses of the receivership.&lt;/p&gt;
