      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Justice REHNQUIST, Circuit Justice.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Applicant has filed a motion for bail pending disposition of his petition for writ of certiorari.  He was arrested in Los Angeles on May 7, 1980 while attempting to board a nonstop flight to Lima, Peru.  Prior to the scheduled departure time, a Customs Official had announced that anyone taking more than $5,000 currency out of the country was required to file a report with the Customs Service.  When stopped on the boarding ramp, petitioner acknowledged that he had heard the announcement but denied that he was carrying more than $5,000.  He repeated this denial during subsequent questioning, but a search of his person and belongings revealed approximately $29,000 in cash as well as a variety of narcotics paraphernalia.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Following a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, applicant was convicted of attempted importation of narcotics;  making false statements to a government official, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1001;  and failing to file a report in connection with the transportation of more than $5,000 outside the United States, in violation of 31 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1101.  He was sentenced to concurrent five-year terms and fined $5,000 each on the first two counts.  He received a consecutive one-year term and a $5,000 fine on the third count.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Applicant was freed on bond pending appeal.  The Court of Appeals, by a divided vote, affirmed his conviction in all respects, and this application followed.  For the reasons explained below, the application is denied.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;The standards to be applied are well-established. Applications for bail to this Court are granted only in extraordinary circumstances, especially where, as here, "the lower court refused to stay its order pending appeal."   &lt;i&gt;Graves v. Barnes,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yg3/curtis-graves-et-al-v-ben-barnes-et-al-diana/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;405&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1201&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 1203, 92 S.Ct. 752, 754, 30 L.Ed.2d 769 (1972) (POWELL, J., in chambers).  At a minimum, a bail applicant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that four Jus ices are likely to vote to grant certiorari.  &lt;i&gt;Bateman v. Arizona,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;429&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;1302&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 1305, 97 S.Ct. 1, 3, 50 L.Ed.2d 32 (1976) (REHNQUIST, J., in chambers).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Applicant raises a number of contentions in his petition, none of which, I believe, is likely to command the vote of four Justices.  First, he argues that 18 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1001 does not apply to his statements at all because those statements were oral, unsworn, exculpatory and immaterial.  A fair reading of the statute, however, brings applicant's false statements to the Customs Official squarely within the prohibition of &amp;#167; 1001.&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn-s" id="fn-s_ref"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; Second, petitioner contends that a conviction under both 18 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1001 and 31 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1101 violates the Double Jeopardy Clause. But under the test established in &lt;i&gt;Blockburger v. United States,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation no-link"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;284&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;299&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed.2d 306 (1932), cumulative punishments under separate statutes are permitted provided only that each statute requires proof of a fact not required by the other.  18 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1001 requires a finding that applicant misled a government official by material false statements.  31 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1101 requires a different finding that applicant failed to file the required currency reporting form.  Thus, the &lt;i&gt;Blockburger&lt;/i&gt; test is satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;Petitioner also claims that the evidence taken from his person and his luggage was the fruit of unconstitutional searches and should have been suppressed.  But see, &lt;i&gt;United States v. Ramsey,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="/scotus/yAX/united-states-v-ramsey/"&gt;&lt;span class="volume"&gt;431&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="reporter"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="page"&gt;606&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 616-619, 97 S.Ct. 1972, 1978-1980, 52 L.Ed.2d 617 (1977) (border searches require neither probable cause nor a warrant).  Petitioner's remaining contentions are even less substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;For these reasons, the application is&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="num" id="p1"&gt;
      &lt;span class="num"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;p class="indent"&gt;
        &lt;i&gt;Denied.&lt;/i&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="footnotes"&gt;
      &lt;div class="footnote" id="fn-s"&gt;
        &lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn-s_ref"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; 18 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1001 provides in relevant part:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, . . . shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
