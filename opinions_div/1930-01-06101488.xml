         </span> (1930) THE FARMERS LOAN &amp;amp; TRUST COMPANY, EXECUTOR, v. MINNESOTA. No. 26.
            <p>Supreme Court of United States.</p> Argued October 30, 1929. Decided January 6, 1930.
         APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF MINNESOTA. <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*205</span> Mr. Cleon Headley, with whom Messrs. Frank B.
            Kellogg and George W. Morgan were on the brief, for appellant.</p>

            Assistant Attorney General, was on the brief, for appellee.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*208</span> MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion
            of the Court.</p>
         <p>Henry R. Taylor, while domiciled and residing in New York, died testate, December 4,
            1925. He had long owned and kept within that State negotiable bonds and certificates of
            indebtedness issued by the State of Minnesota and the Cities of Minneapolis and St.
            Paul, worth above $300,000. Some of these were registered, others were payable to
            bearer. None had any connection with business carried on by or for the decedent in
            Minnesota. All passed under his will which was probated in New York. There also his
            estate was administered and a tax exacted upon the testamentary transfer.</p>
         <p>Minnesota assessed an inheritance tax upon the same transfer. Her Supreme Court approved
            this and upheld the validity of the authorizing statute. The executor &#x97; appellant
            &#x97; claims that, so construed and applied, that enactment conflicts with the
            Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
         <p>When this cause first came before the Supreme Court of Minnesota it held negotiable
            public obligations were something more than mere evidences of debt and, like tangibles,
            taxable only at the place where found, regardless of the owner's domicile. It
            accordingly denied the power of that State to tax the testamentary transfer. After

            </span>, it felt obliged to treat the bonds and certificates like ordinary choses in
            action and to uphold the assessment.</p>
         <p>Registration of certain of the bonds we regard as an immaterial circumstance. So did the
            court below. Counsel do not maintain otherwise.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*209</span> Under Blodgett v. Silberman the obligations
            here involved were rightly regarded as if ordinary choses in action. The maxim mobilia
            sequuntur personam applied and gave them situs for taxation in New York &#x97; the
            owner's domicile. The testamentary transfer was properly taxed there. This is not
            controverted.</p>
         <p>But it is said the obligations were debts of Minnesota and her corporations, subject to
            her control; that her laws gave them validity, protected them and provided means for
            enforcing payment. Accordingly, counsel argue that they had situs for taxation purposes
            in that State and maintain the validity of the challenged assessment.</p>
         <p>Blackstone v. Miller, supra, and certain approving opinions, lend support to the
            doctrine that ordinarily choses in action are subject to taxation both at the debtor's
            domicile and at the domicile of the creditor; that two States may tax on different and
            more or less inconsistent principles the same testamentary transfer of such property
            without conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment. The inevitable tendency of that view is
            to disturb good relations among the States and produce the kind of discontent expected
            to subside after establishment of the Union. The <ref type="" num="">Federalist</ref>, No. VII. The practical
            effect of it has been bad; perhaps two-thirds of the States have endeavored to avoid the
            evil by resort to reciprocal exemption laws. It has been stoutly assailed on principle.
            Having reconsidered the supporting arguments in the light of our more recent opinions,
            we are compelled to declare it untenable. Blackstone v. Miller no longer can be regarded
            as a correct exposition of existing law; and to prevent misunderstanding it is
            definitely overruled.</p>
         <p>Four different views concerning the situs for taxation of negotiable public obligations
            have been advanced. One fixes this at the domicile of the owner; another at the debtor's
            domicile; a third at the place where the instruments <span class="star-pagination"
               >*210</span> are found &#x97; physically present; and the fourth within the
            jurisdiction where the owner has caused them to become integral parts of a localized
            business. If each State can adopt any one of these and tax accordingly, obviously, the
            same bonds may be declared present for taxation in two, or three, or four places at the
            same moment. Such a startling possibility suggests a wrong premise.</p>
         <p>In this Court the presently approved doctrine is that no State may tax anything not
            within her jurisdiction without violating the Fourteenth Amendment. State Tax on Foreign

            definitely settled subsequent to Blackstone v. Miller and are out of harmony with the
            reasoning advanced to support the conclusion there announced.</p>
         <p>At this time it cannot be assumed that tangible chattels permanently located within
            another State may be treated as part of the universal succession and taken into account
            when estimating the succession tax laid at the decedent's domicile. Frick v.
            Pennsylvania is to the contrary.</p>
         <p>Nor is it permissible broadly to say that notwithstanding the Fourteenth Amendment two
            States have power to tax the same personalty on different and inconsistent principles or
            that a State always may tax according to the fiction that in successions after death
            mobilia sequuntur personam and domicile govern the whole. Union Refrig. Transit Co. v.

            </span>, 524, though frequently cited to support the general affirmation that nothing in
            the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits double taxation, does not go so far. It affirmed the
            rather obvious proposition that the mere fact of taxation of tangibles by one State is
            not enough to exclude the right of another to tax them.</p>
         <p>"If the owner of personal property within a State resides in another State which taxes
            him for that property as part of his general estate attached to his person, this action
            of the latter State does not in the least affect the right of the State in which the
            property is situated to tax it also. . . . The fact, therefore, that the owners of the
            logs in question were taxed for their value in Maine as a part of their general stock in
            trade, if such fact were proved, could have no influence in the decision of the case and
            may be laid out of view."</p>
         <p>If Maine undertook to tax logs permanently located in another State, she transcended her
            legitimate powers. Union Refrig. Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra. Of course, such action
            could not affect New Hampshire's rights in respect of property localized within her
            limits.</p>
         <p>While debts have no actual territorial situs we have ruled that a State may properly
            apply the rule mobilia sequuntur personam and treat them as localized at the creditor's
            domicile for taxation purposes. Tangibles with permanent situs therein, and their
            testamentary transfer, may be taxed only by the State where they are found. And, we
            think, the general reasons declared sufficient to inhibit taxation of them by two States
            apply under present circumstances with no less force to intangibles with taxable situs
            imposed by due application of the legal fiction. Primitive conditions have passed;
            business is <span class="star-pagination">*212</span> now transacted on a national
            scale. A very large part of the country's wealth is invested in negotiable securities
            whose protection against discrimination, unjust and oppressive taxation, is matter of
            the greatest moment. Twenty-four years ago Union Refrig. Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra,
            declared &#x97; ". .. in view of the enormous increase of such property [tangible
            personalty] since the introduction of railways and the growth of manufactures, the
            tendency has been in recent years to treat it as having a situs of its own for the
            purpose of taxation, and correlatively to exempt [it] at the domicile of the owner."
            And, certainly, existing conditions no less imperatively demand protection of choses in
            action against multiplied taxation whether following misapplication of some legal
            fiction or conflicting theories concerning the sovereign's right to exact contributions.
            For many years the trend of decisions here has been in that direction.</p>
         <p>Taxation is an intensely practical matter and laws in respect of it should be construed
            and applied with a view of avoiding, so far as possible, unjust and oppressive
            consequences. We have determined that in general intangibles may be properly taxed at
            the domicile of their owner and we can find no sufficient reason for saying that they
            are not entitled to enjoy an immunity against taxation at more than one place similar to
            that accorded to tangibles. The difference between the two things, although obvious
            enough, seems insufficient to justify the harsh and oppressive discrimination against
            intangibles contended for on behalf of Minnesota.</p>

               <span class="citation no-link">

               <span class="page">300</span>
            </span>, 320, distinctly held that the State was without power to tax the owner of bonds
            of a domestic railroad corporation made and payable outside her limits when issued to
            and held by citizens and residents of another State. Through Mr. Justice Field the Court
            there said &#x97;</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*213</span> "But debts owing by corporations, like debts
            owing by individuals, are not property of the debtors in any sense; they are obligations
            of the debtors, and only possess value in the hands of the creditors. With them they are
            property, and in their hands they may be taxed. To call debts property of the debtors is
            simply to misuse terms. All the property there can be in the nature of things in debts
            of corporations, belongs to the creditors, to whom they are payable, and follows their
            domicile, wherever that may be. Their debts can have no locality separate from the
            parties to whom they are due. This principle might be stated in many different ways, and
            supported by citations from numerous adjudications, but no number of authorities, and no
            forms of expression could add anything to its obvious truth, which is recognized upon
            its simple statement."</p>
         <p>If the situs of the bonds for taxation had been at the debtor's domicile &#x97;
            Pennsylvania &#x97; the challenged effort to tax could not have interfered unduly with
            the debtor's contract to pay interest.</p>

            And while the creditor may rely on Minnesota law to enforce the debt, that may be
            equally true of the law of any other state where the debtor or his property may be
            found. So far as the transfer, as distinguished from the contract itself, is concerned,
            it is New York law and not that of Minnesota which, by generally accepted rules, is
            applied there and receives recognition elsewhere. See Bullen v. Wisconsin, <span

            </span>, 460; Spencer v. Myers, 150 N.Y. 269. Once the bonds had passed beyond the state
            and were acquired by an owner domiciled elsewhere, the law of Minnesota neither
            protected, nor could it withhold the power of transfer or prescribe its terms.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*215</span> In the light of these considerations, granting
            that the continued existence of the contract rested in part on the law of Minnesota, the
            relation of that law to the transfer in New York, both in point of theory and in every
            practical aspect, appears to me to be too attenuated to constitute any reasonable basis
            for deeming the transfer to be within the taxing jurisdiction of Minnesota.</p>
         <p>As the present is not a tax on the debt, but only on the transfer of it, neither the
            analogies drawn from the law of property taxes nor the attempt to solve the present
            problem by ascribing to a legal relationship unconnected with any physical thing, a
            fictitious situs, can, I think, carry us very far toward a solution. Nor does it seem
            that the invocation of the Fourteenth Amendment to relieve from the burdens of double
            taxation, as such, promises more.</p>
         <p>Hitherto the fact that taxation is "double" has not been deemed to affect its
            constitutionality and there are, I think, too many situations in which a single economic
            interest may have such legal relationships with different taxing jurisdictions as to
            justify its taxation in both, to admit of our laying down any constitutional principle
            broadly prohibiting taxation merely because it is double, at least until that
            characterization is more precisely defined.</p>
         <p>It seems to me to be unnecessary and undesirable to lay down any doctrine whose extent
            and content are so dubious. Whether it is far reaching enough to overturn those cases
            which, in circumstances differing somewhat from the present, have been regarded as
            permitting taxation in more than one state, reaching the same economic interest, is so
            uncertain as to suggest doubts of its trustworthiness and utility as a principle of
            judicial decision. See Wheeler v. Sohmer, <span class="citation">

         <p>MR. JUSTICE HOLMES, dissenting.</p>
         <p>This is a proceeding for the determination of a tax alleged to be due to the State of
            Minnesota but objected to by the appellant as contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of
            the Constitution of the United States. The tax is imposed in respect of the transfer by
            will of bonds and certificates of indebtedness of the State of Minnesota and bonds of
            two cities of that State. The testator died domiciled in New York and the bonds were
            there at the time of his death. The Supreme Court of the State upheld the tax, In re
            Estate of Taylor, <span class="citation">

               </a>
            </span>, and the executor appeals.</p>
         <p>It is not disputed that the transfer was taxable in New York, but there is no
            constitutional objection to the same transaction being taxed by two States, if the laws
            of both have to be invoked in order to give it effect. It may be assumed that the
            transfer considered by itself alone depends on the law of New York, but if the law of
            Minnesota is necessary to the existence of anything beyond a piece of paper to be
            transferred then Minnesota may demand payment for a privilege that could not exist
            without its help. It seems to me that the law of Minnesota is a <span
               class="star-pagination">*217</span> present force necessary to the existence of the
            obligation, and that therefore, however contrary it may be to enlightened policy, the
            tax is good.</p>
         <p>No one would doubt that the law of Minnesota was necessary to call the obligation into
            existence. Other States do not attempt to determine the legal consequences of acts done
            outside of their jurisdiction, and therefore whether certain acts done in Minnesota
            constitute a contract or not depends on the law of Minnesota alone. I think the same
            thing is true of the continuance of the obligation to the present time. It seems to me
            that it is the law of Minnesota alone that keeps the debt alive. Obviously at the
            beginning that law could have provided that the debt should be extinguished by the death
            of the creditor or by such other event as that law might point out. It gave the debt its
            duration. The continued operation of that law keeps the debt alive. Not to go too far
            into the field of speculation but confining the discussion to cities of the State and
            the State itself, the continued existence of the cities and the readiness of the State
            to keep its promises depend upon the will of the State. If there were no Constitution
            the State might abolish the debt by its fiat. The only effect of the Constitution is
            that the law that originally gave the bonds continuance remains in force unchanged. But
            it is still the law of that State and no other. When such obligations are enforced by
            suit in another State it is on the footing of recognition, not of creation. Deutsche
            Bank Filiale Nurnberg v. Humphrey, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/w1t/deutsche-bank-filiale-nurnberg-v-humphrey/">

               </a>
            </span>, 519. Another State, if it is civilized, does not undertake to say to the debtor
            now that we have caught you we will force an obligation upon you whether you still are
            bound by the law of your own State or not. I believe this to be the vital point. Unless
            I am wrong the debt, wherever enforced, is enforced only because it is recognized as
            such by the law that created it and keeps it still a debt. No doubt sometimes
            obligations are enforced elsewhere when <span class="star-pagination">*218</span> the
            statute of limitations has run at home. But such decisions when defencible stand on the
            ground that the limitation is only procedural and does not extinguish the duty. If the
            statute extinguishes the debt by lapse of time no foreign jurisdiction that
            intelligently understood its function would attempt to make the debtor pay.</p>
         <p>I will not repeat what I said the other day in Safe Deposit &amp;amp; Trust Co. v.
            Virginia, ante, p. 83, concerning the attempt to draw conclusions from the supposed
            situs of a debt. The right to tax exists in this case because the party needs the help
            of Minnesota to acquire a right, and that State can demand a quid pro quo in return.

         <p>I do not dwell on the practical necessity of resorting to the State in order to secure
            payment of state or municipal bonds. Even if the creditor had a complete and adequate
            remedy elsewhere, I still should think that a correct decision of the case must rest on
            whether I am right or not about the theoretical dependence of the continued existence of
            the bonds upon Minnesota law.</p>

            The Amendment does not condemn everything that we may think undesirable on economic or
            social grounds.</p>
