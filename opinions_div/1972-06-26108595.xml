            Court of United States.</p> Argued March 27, 1972. Decided June 26, 1972. CERTIORARI TO
         THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT. <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*2</span> Solicitor General Griswold argued the cause for
            petitioners. With him on the briefs were Assistant Attorney General Mardian and Robert
            L. Keuch.</p>
         <p>Frank Askin argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief was Melvin L.
            Wulf.</p>
         <p>Sam J. Ervin, Jr., argued the cause for the Unitarian Universalist Assn. et al. as amici
            curiae urging affirmance. With him on the brief was Lawrence M. Baskir.</p>
         <p>Burke Marshall and Arthur R. Miller filed a brief for a Group of Former Army
            Intelligence Agents as amici curiae urging affirmance.</p>
         <p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
         <p>Respondents brought this class action in the District Court seeking declaratory and
            injunctive relief on their claim that their rights were being invaded by the Department
            of the Army's alleged "surveillance of lawful and peaceful civilian political activity."
            The petitioners in response described the activity as "gathering by lawful means . . .
            [and] maintaining and using in their intelligence activities . . . information relating
            to potential or actual civil disturbances [or] street demonstrations." In connection
            with respondents' motion for a preliminary injunction and petitioners' motion to dismiss
            the complaint, both parties filed a number of affidavits with the District Court and
            presented their oral arguments at a hearing on the two motions. On the basis of the
               pleadings,<span class="sup">[1]</span> the affidavits before the court, and the oral
            arguments advanced at the hearing, the <span class="star-pagination">*3</span> District
            Court granted petitioners' motion to dismiss, holding that there was no justiciable
            claim for relief.</p>
         <p>On appeal, a divided Court of Appeals reversed and ordered the case remanded for further
            proceedings. We granted certiorari to consider whether, as the Court of Appeals held,
            respondents presented a justiciable controversy in complaining of a "chilling" effect on
            the exercise of their First Amendment rights where such effect is allegedly caused, not
            by any "specific action of the Army against them, [but] only [by] the existence and
            operation of the intelligence gathering and distributing system, which is confined to
            the Army and related civilian investigative agencies." 144 U. S. App. D. C. 72, 78, 444
            F. 2d 947, 953. We reverse.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>(1)</h2>
         <p>There is in the record a considerable amount of background information regarding the
            activities of which respondents complained; this information is set out primarily in the
            affidavits that were filed by the parties in connection with the District Court's
            consideration of respondents' motion for a preliminary injunction and petitioners'
            motion to dismiss. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12 (b). A brief review of that information
            is helpful to an understanding of the issues.</p>
         <p>The President is authorized by 10 U. S. C. § 331<span class="sup">[2]</span> to make use
            of the armed forces to quell insurrection <span class="star-pagination">*4</span> and
            other domestic violence if and when the conditions described in that section obtain
            within one of the States. Pursuant to those provisions, President Johnson ordered <span
               class="star-pagination">*5</span> federal troops to assist local authorities at the
            time of the civil disorders in Detroit, Michigan, in the summer of 1967 and during the
            disturbances that followed the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King. Prior to the
            Detroit disorders, the Army had a general contingency plan for providing such assistance
            to local authorities, but the 1967 experience led Army authorities to believe that more
            attention should be given to such preparatory planning. The data-gathering system here
            involved is said to have been established in connection with the development of more
            detailed and specific contingency planning designed to permit the Army, when called upon
            to assist local authorities, to be able to respond effectively with a minimum of force.
            As the Court of Appeals observed,</p> "In performing this type function the Army is
         essentially a police force or the back-up of a local police force. To quell disturbances or
         to prevent further disturbances the Army needs the same tools and, most importantly, the
         same information to which local police forces have access. Since the Army is sent into
         territory almost invariably unfamiliar to most soldiers and their commanders, their need
         for information is likely to be greater than that of the hometown policeman. "No logical
         argument can be made for compelling the military to use blind force. When force is employed
            <span class="star-pagination">*6</span> it should be intelligently directed, and this
         depends upon having reliable information&#x97;in time. As Chief Justice John Marshall said
         of Washington, `A general must be governed by his intelligence and must regulate his
         measures by his information. It is his duty to obtain correct information . . . .' So we
         take it as undeniable that the military, i. e., the Army, need a certain amount of
         information in order to perform their constitutional and statutory missions." 144 U. S.
         App. D. C., at 77-78, 444 F. 2d, at 952-953 (footnotes omitted). <p>The system put into
            operation as a result of the Army's 1967 experience consisted essentially of the
            collection of information about public activities that were thought to have at least
            some potential for civil disorder, the reporting of that information to Army
            Intelligence headquarters at Fort Holabird, Maryland, the dissemination of these reports
            from headquarters to major Army posts around the country, and the storage of the
            reported information in a computer data bank located at Fort Holabird. The information
            itself was collected by a variety of means, but it is significant that the principal
            sources of information were the news media and publications in general circulation. Some
            of the information came from Army Intelligence agents who attended meetings that were
            open to the public and who wrote field reports describing the meetings, giving such data
            as the name of the sponsoring organization, the identity of speakers, the approximate
            number of persons in attendance, and an indication of whether any disorder occurred. And
            still other information was provided to the Army by civilian law enforcement
            agencies.</p>
         <p>The material filed by the Government in the District Court reveals that Army
            Intelligence has field offices in various parts of the country; these offices are
            staffed in the aggregate with approximately 1,000 agents, 94% <span
               class="star-pagination">*7</span> of whose time<span class="sup">[3]</span> is
            devoted to the organization's principal mission,<span class="sup">[4]</span> which is
            unrelated to the domestic surveillance system here involved.</p>
         <p>By early 1970 Congress became concerned with the scope of the Army's domestic
            surveillance system; hearings on the matter were held before the Subcommittee on
            Constitutional Rights of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. Meanwhile, the Army, in
            the course of a review of the system, ordered a significant reduction in its scope. For
            example, information referred to in the complaint as the "blacklist" and the records in
            the computer data bank at Fort Holabird were found unnecessary and were destroyed, along
            with other related records. One copy of all the material relevant to the instant suit
            was retained, however, because of the pendency of this litigation. The review leading to
            the destruction of these records was said at the time the District Court ruled on
            petitioners' motion to dismiss to be a "continuing" one (App. 82), and the Army's
            policies at that time were represented as follows in a letter from the Under Secretary
            of the Army to Senator Sam J. Ervin, Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on
            Constitutional Rights:</p> "[R]eports concerning civil disturbances will be limited to
         matters of immediate concern to the Army&#x97;that is, reports concerning outbreaks of
         violence or incidents with a high potential for violence beyond the capability of state and
         local police and <span class="star-pagination">*8</span> the National Guard to control.
         These reports will be collected by liaison with other Government agencies and reported by
         teletype to the Intelligence Command. They will not be placed in a computer. . . . These
         reports are destroyed 60 days after publication or 60 days after the end of the
         disturbance. This limited reporting system will ensure that the Army is prepared to respond
         to whatever directions the President may issue in civil disturbance situations and without
         `watching' the lawful activities of civilians." (App. 80.) <p>In briefs for petitioners
            filed with this Court, the Solicitor General has called our attention to certain
            directives issued by the Army and the Department of Defense subsequent to the District
            Court's dismissal of the action; these directives indicate that the Army's review of the
            needs of its domestic intelligence activities has indeed been a continuing one and that
            those activities have since been significantly reduced.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>(2)</h2>
         <p>The District Court held a combined hearing on respondents' motion for a preliminary
            injunction and petitioners' motion for dismissal and thereafter announced its holding
            that respondents had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. It was
            the view of the District Court that respondents failed to allege any action on the part
            of the Army that was unlawful in itself and further failed to allege any injury or any
            realistic threats to their rights growing out of the Army's actions.<span class="sup"
               >[5]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*9</span> In reversing, the Court of Appeals noted that
            respondents "have some difficulty in establishing visible injury":</p> "[They] freely
         admit that they complain of no specific action of the Army against them . . . . There is no
         evidence of illegal or unlawful surveillance activities. We are not cited to any
         clandestine intrusion by a military agent. So far as is yet shown, the information gathered
         is nothing more than a good newspaper reporter would be able to gather by attendance at
         public meetings and the clipping of articles from publications available on any newsstand."
         144 U. S. App. D. C., at 78, 444 F. 2d, at 953. <p>The court took note of petitioners'
            argument "that nothing [detrimental to respondents] has been done, that nothing is
            contemplated to be done, and even if some action by the Army against [respondents] were
            possibly foreseeable, such would not present a presently justiciable controversy." With
            respect to this argument, the Court of Appeals had this to say:</p> "This position of
         the [petitioners] does not accord full measure to the rather unique argument advanced by
         appellants [respondents]. While [respondents] do indeed argue that in the future it is
         possible that <span class="star-pagination">*10</span> information relating to matters far
         beyond the responsibilities of the military may be misused by the military to the detriment
         of these civilian [respondents], yet [respondents] do not attempt to establish this as a
         definitely foreseeable event, or to base their complaint on this ground. Rather,
         [respondents] contend that the present existence of this system of gathering and
         distributing information, allegedly far beyond the mission requirements of the Army,
         constitutes an impermissible burden on [respondents] and other persons similarly situated
         which exercises a present inhibiting effect on their full expression and utilization of
         their First Amendment rights . . . ." Id., at 79, 444 F. 2d, at 954. (Emphasis in
         original.) <p>Our examination of the record satisfies us that the Court of Appeals properly
            identified the issue presented, namely, whether the jurisdiction of a federal court may
            be invoked by a complainant who alleges that the exercise of his First Amendment rights
            is being chilled by the mere existence, without more, of a governmental investigative
            and data-gathering activity that is alleged to be broader in scope than is reasonably
            necessary for the accomplishment of a valid governmental purpose. We conclude, however,
            that, having properly identified the issue, the Court of Appeals decided that issue
               incorrectly.<span class="sup">[6]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*11</span> In recent years this Court has found in a
            number of cases that constitutional violations may arise from the deterrent, or
            "chilling," effect of governmental regulations that fall short of a direct prohibition
            against the exercise of First Amendment rights. E. g., Baird v. State Bar of Arizona,
            401 U. S. 1 (1971); Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U. S. 589 (1967); Lamont v.
            Postmaster General, 381 U. S. 301 (1965); Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U. S. 360 (1964). In
            none of these cases, however, did the chilling effect arise merely from the individual's
            knowledge that a governmental agency was engaged in certain activities or from the
            individual's concomitant fear that, armed with the fruits of those activities, the
            agency might in the future take some other and additional action detrimental to that
            individual. Rather, in each of these cases, the challenged exercise of governmental
            power was regulatory, proscriptive, or compulsory in nature, and the complainant was
            either presently or prospectively subject to the regulations, proscriptions, or
            compulsions that he was challenging.</p>
         <p>For example, the petitioner in Baird v. State Bar of Arizona had been denied admission
            to the bar solely because of her refusal to answer a question regarding the
            organizations with which she had been associated in the past. In announcing the judgment
            of the Court, <span class="star-pagination">*12</span> Mr. Justice Black said that "a
            State may not inquire about a man's views or associations solely for the purpose of
            withholding a right or benefit because of what he believes." 401 U. S., at 7. Some of
            the teachers who were the complainants in Keyishian v. Board of Regents had been
            discharged from employment by the State, and the others were threatened with such
            discharge, because of their political acts or associations. The Court concluded that the
            State's "complicated and intricate scheme" of laws and regulations relating to teacher
            loyalty could not withstand constitutional scrutiny; it was not permissible to inhibit
            First Amendment expression by forcing a teacher to "guess what conduct or utterance"
            might be in violation of that complex regulatory scheme and might thereby "lose him his
            position." 385 U. S., at 604. Lamont v. Postmaster General dealt with a governmental
            regulation requiring private individuals to make a special written request to the Post
            Office for delivery of each individual mailing of certain kinds of political literature
            addressed to them. In declaring the regulation invalid, the Court said: "The addressee
            carries an affirmative obligation which we do not think the Government may impose on
            him." 381 U. S., at 307. Baggett v. Bullitt dealt with a requirement that an oath of
            vague and uncertain meaning be taken as a condition of employment by a governmental
            agency. The Court said: "Those with a conscientious regard for what they solemnly swear
            or affirm, sensitive to the perils posed by the oath's indefinite language, avoid the
            risk of loss of employment, and perhaps profession, only by restricting their conduct to
            that which is unquestionably safe. Free speech may not be so inhibited." 377 U. S., at
            372.</p>
         <p>The decisions in these cases fully recognize that governmental action may be subject to
            constitutional challenge even though it has only an indirect effect on the <span
               class="star-pagination">*13</span> exercise of First Amendment rights. At the same
            time, however, these decisions have in no way eroded the</p> "established principle that
         to entitle a private individual to invoke the judicial power to determine the validity of
         executive or legislative action he must show that he has sustained or is immediately in
         danger of sustaining a direct injury as the result of that action . . . ." Ex parte Levitt,
         302 U. S. 633, 634 (1937). <p>The respondents do not meet this test; their claim, simply
            stated, is that they disagree with the judgments made by the Executive Branch with
            respect to the type and amount of information the Army needs and that the very existence
            of the Army's data-gathering system produces a constitutionally impermissible chilling
            effect upon the exercise of their First Amendment rights. That alleged "chilling" effect
            may perhaps be seen as arising from respondents' very perception of the system as
            inappropriate to the Army's role under our form of government, or as arising from
            respondents' beliefs that it is inherently dangerous for the military to be concerned
            with activities in the civilian sector, or as arising from respondents' less generalized
            yet speculative apprehensiveness that the Army may at some future date misuse the
            information in some way that would cause direct harm to respondents.<span class="sup"
               >[7]</span> Allegations of a subjective "chill" <span class="star-pagination"
               >*14</span> are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific present objective
            harm or a threat of specific future harm; "the federal courts established pursuant to
            Article III of the Constitution do not render advisory opinions." United Public Workers
            v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75, 89 (1947).</p>
         <p>Stripped to its essentials, what respondents appear to be seeking is a broad-scale
            investigation, conducted by themselves as private parties armed with the subpoena power
            of a federal district court and the power of cross-examination, to probe into the Army's
            intelligence-gathering activities, with the district court determining at the conclusion
            of that investigation the extent to which those activities may or may not be appropriate
            to the Army's mission. The following excerpt from the opinion of the Court of Appeals
            suggests the broad sweep implicit in its holding:</p> "Apparently in the judgment of the
         civilian head of the Army not everything being done in the operation of this intelligence
         system was necessary to the performance of the military mission. If the Secretary of the
         Army can formulate and implement such judgment based on facts within his Departmental <span
            class="star-pagination">*15</span> knowledge, the United States District Court can hear
         evidence, ascertain the facts, and decide what, if any, further restrictions on the
         complained-of activities are called for to confine the military to their legitimate sphere
         of activity and to protect [respondents'] allegedly infringed constitutional rights." 144
         U. S. App. D. C., at 83, 444 F. 2d, at 958. (Emphasis added.) <p>Carried to its logical
            end, this approach would have the federal courts as virtually continuing monitors of the
            wisdom and soundness of Executive action; such a role is appropriate for the Congress
            acting through its committees and the "power of the purse"; it is not the role of the
            judiciary, absent actual present or immediately threatened injury resulting from
            unlawful governmental action.</p>
         <p>We, of course, intimate no view with respect to the propriety or desirability, from a
            policy standpoint, of the challenged activities of the Department of the Army; our
            conclusion is a narrow one, namely, that on this record the respondents have not
            presented a case for resolution by the courts.</p>
         <p>The concerns of the Executive and Legislative Branches in response to disclosure of the
            Army surveillance activities &#x97;and indeed the claims alleged in the complaint&#x97;
            reflect a traditional and strong resistance of Americans to any military intrusion into
            civilian affairs. That tradition has deep roots in our history and found early
            expression, for example, in the Third Amendment's explicit prohibition against
            quartering soldiers in private homes without consent and in the constitutional
            provisions for civilian control of the military. Those prohibitions are not directly
            presented by this case, but their philosophical underpinnings explain our traditional
            insistence on limitations on military operations in peacetime. Indeed, when presented
            with claims of judicially cognizable injury <span class="star-pagination">*16</span>
            resulting from military intrusion into the civilian sector, federal courts are fully
            empowered to consider claims of those asserting such injury; there is nothing in our
            Nation's history or in this Court's decided cases, including our holding today, that can
            properly be seen as giving any indication that actual or threatened injury by reason of
            unlawful activities of the military would go unnoticed or unremedied.</p>

      <div type="dissent" judge="douglas"><p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL concurs,
            dissenting.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>If Congress had passed a law authorizing the armed services to establish surveillance
            over the civilian population, a most serious constitutional problem would be presented.
            There is, however, no law authorizing surveillance over civilians, which in this case
            the Pentagon concededly had undertaken. The question is whether such authority may be
            implied. One can search the Constitution in vain for any such authority.</p>
         <p>The start of the problem is the constitutional distinction between the "militia" and the
            Armed Forces. By Art. I, § 8, of the Constitution the militia is specifically confined
            to precise duties: "to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel
            Invasions."</p>
         <p>This obviously means that the "militia" cannot be sent overseas to fight wars. It is
            purely a domestic arm of the governors of the several States,<span class="sup"
               >[1]</span> save as it may be called under Art. I, § 8, of the Constitution into the
            federal service. Whether the "militia" could be <span class="star-pagination">*17</span>
            given powers comparable to those granted the FBI is a question not now raised, for we
            deal here not with the "militia" but with "armies." The Army, Navy, and Air Force are
            comprehended in the constitutional term "armies." Article I, § 8, provides that Congress
            may "raise and support Armies," and "provide and maintain a Navy," and make "Rules for
            the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces." And the Fifth Amendment
            excepts from the requirement of a presentment or indictment of a grand jury "cases
            arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time
            of War or public danger."</p>
         <p>Acting under that authority, Congress has provided a code governing the Armed Services.
            That code sets the procedural standards for the Government and regulation of the land
            and naval forces. It is difficult to imagine how those powers can be extended to
            military surveillance over civilian affairs.<span class="sup">[2]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The most pointed and relevant decisions of the Court on the limitation of military
            authority concern the attempt of the military to try civilians. The first leading case
            was Ex parte Milligan, <span class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">4</span>
               <span class="reporter">Wall.</span>
               <span class="page">2</span>
            </span>, 124, where the Court noted that the conflict between "civil liberty" and
            "martial law" is "irreconcilable." The Court which made that announcement would have
            been horrified at the prospect of the military&#x97;absent a regime of martial
            law&#x97;establishing a regime of surveillance over civilians. The power of the military
            to establish such a system is obviously less than the power of Congress to authorize
            such surveillance. For the authority of Congress is restricted by its power to "raise"
            armies, Art. I, § 8; and, to repeat, its authority over the Armed Forces is stated in
            these terms, "To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval
            Forces."</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*18</span> The Constitution contains many provisions
            guaranteeing rights to persons. Those include the right to indictment by a grand jury
            and the right to trial by a jury of one's peers. They include the procedural safeguards
            of the Sixth Amendment in criminal prosecutions; the protection against double jeopardy,
            cruel and unusual punishments &#x97;and, of course, the First Amendment. The alarm was
            sounded in the Constitutional Convention about the dangers of the armed services. Luther
            Martin of Maryland said, "when a government wishes to deprive its citizens of freedom,
            and reduce them to slavery, it generally makes use of a standing army."<span class="sup"
               >[3]</span> That danger, we have held, exists not only in bold acts of usurpation of
            power, but also in gradual encroachments. We held that court-martial jurisdiction cannot
            be extended to reach any person not a member of the Armed Forces at the times both of
            the offense and of the trial, which eliminates discharged soldiers. Toth v. Quarles, 350
            U. S. 11. Neither civilian employees of the Armed Forces overseas, McElroy v.
            Guagliardo, 361 U. S. 281; Grisham v. Hagan, 361 U. S. 278, nor civilian dependents of
            military personnel accompanying them overseas, Kinsella v. Singleton, 361 U. S. 234;
            Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, may be tried by court-martial. And even as respects those
            in the Armed Forces we have held that an offense must be "service connected" to be tried
            by court-martial rather than by a civilian tribunal. O'Callahan v. Parker, 395 U. S.
            258, 272.</p>
         <p>The upshot is that the Armed Services&#x97;as distinguished from the "militia"&#x97;are
            not regulatory agencies or bureaus that may be created as Congress desires and granted
            such powers as seem necessary and proper. The authority to provide rules "governing" the
            Armed Services means the grant of authority to the Armed <span class="star-pagination"
               >*19</span> Services to govern themselves, not the authority to govern civilians.
            Even when "martial law" is declared, as it often has been, its appropriateness is
            subject to judicial review, Sterling v. Constantin, 287 U. S. 378, 401, 403-404.<span
               class="sup">[4]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Our tradition reflects a desire for civilian supremacy and subordination of military
            power. The tradition goes back to the Declaration of Independence, in which it was
            recited that the King "has affected to render the Military independent of and superior
            to the Civil power." Thus, we have the "militia" restricted to domestic use, the
            restriction of appropriations to the "armies" to two years, Art. I, § 8, and the grant
            of command over the armies and the militia when called into actual service of the United
            States to the President, our chief civilian officer. The tradition of civilian control
            over the Armed Forces was stated by Chief Justice Warren:<span class="sup">[5]</span>
         </p> "The military establishment is, of course, a necessary organ of government; but the
         reach of its power must be carefully limited lest the delicate balance between freedom and
         order be upset. The maintenance of the balance is made more difficult by <span
            class="star-pagination">*20</span> the fact that while the military serves the vital
         function of preserving the existence of the nation, it is, at the same time, the one
         element of government that exercises a type of authority not easily assimilated in a free
         society. . . . ..... "In times of peace, the factors leading to an extraordinary deference
         to claims of military necessity have naturally not been as weighty. This has been true even
         in the all too imperfect peace that has been our lot for the past fifteen years&#x97;and
         quite rightly so, in my judgment. It is instructive to recall that our Nation at the time
         of the Constitutional Convention was also faced with formidable problems. The English, the
         French, the Spanish, and various tribes of hostile Indians were all ready and eager to
         subvert or occupy the fledgling Republic. Nevertheless, in that environment, our Founding
         Fathers conceived a Constitution and Bill of Rights replete with provisions indicating
         their determination to protect human rights. There was no call for a garrison state in
         those times of precarious peace. We should heed no such call now. If we were to fail in
         these days to enforce the freedom that until now has been the American citizen's
         birthright, we would be abandoning for the foreseeable future the constitutional balance of
         powers and rights in whose name we arm." <p>Thus, we have until today consistently adhered
            to the belief that</p> "[i]t is an unbending rule of law, that the exercise of military
         power, where the rights of the citizen are concerned, shall never be pushed beyond what the
         exigency requires." Raymond v. Thomas, 91 U. S. 712, 716. <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*21</span> It was in that tradition that Youngstown Sheet
            &amp;amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, was decided, in which President Truman's
            seizure of the steel mills in the so-called Korean War was held unconstitutional. As
            stated by Justice Black:</p> "The order cannot properly be sustained as an exercise of
         the President's military power as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. The Government
         attempts to do so by citing a number of cases upholding broad powers in military commanders
         engaged in day-to-day fighting in a theater of war. Such cases need not concern us here.
         Even though `theater of war' be an expanding concept, we cannot with faithfulness to our
         constitutional system hold that the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces has the ultimate
         power as such to take possession of private property in order to keep labor disputes from
         stopping production. This is a job for the Nation's lawmakers, not for its military
         authorities." Id., at 587. <p>Madison expressed the fear of military dominance:<span
               class="sup">[6]</span>
         </p> "The veteran legions of Rome were an overmatch for the undisciplined valor of all
         other nations, and rendered her the mistress of the world. "Not the less true is it, that
         the liberties of Rome proved the final victim to her military triumphs; and that the
         liberties of Europe, as far as they ever existed, have, with few exceptions, been the price
         of her military establishments. A standing force, therefore, is a dangerous, at the same
         time that it may be a necessary, provision. On the smallest scale it has its
         inconveniences. On an extensive <span class="star-pagination">*22</span> scale its
         consequences may be fatal. On any scale it is an object of laudable circumspection and
         precaution. A wise nation will combine all these considerations; and, whilst it does not
         rashly preclude itself from any resource which may become essential to its safety, will
         exert all its prudence in diminishing both the necessity and the danger of resorting to one
         which may be inauspicious to its liberties. "The clearest marks of this prudence are
         stamped on the proposed Constitution. The Union itself, which it cements and secures,
         destroys every pretext for a military establishment which could be dangerous. America
         united, with a handful of troops, or without a single soldier, exhibits a more forbidding
         posture to foreign ambition than America disunited, with a hundred thousand veterans ready
         for combat." <p>As Chief Justice Warren has observed, the safeguards in the main body of
            the Constitution did not satisfy the people on their fear and concern of military
               dominance:<span class="sup">[7]</span>
         </p> "They were reluctant to ratify the Constitution without further assurances, and thus
         we find in the Bill of Rights Amendments 2 and 3, specifically authorizing a decentralized
         militia, guaranteeing the right of the people to keep and bear arms, and prohibiting the
         quartering of troops in any house in time of peace without the consent of the owner. Other
         Amendments guarantee the right of the people to assemble, to be secure in their homes
         against unreasonable searches and seizures, and in criminal cases to be accorded a speedy
         and public trial by an impartial jury after indictment in the district <span
            class="star-pagination">*23</span> and state wherein the crime was committed. The only
         exceptions made to these civilian trial procedures are for cases arising in the land and
         naval forces. Although there is undoubtedly room for argument based on the frequently
         conflicting sources of history, it is not unreasonable to believe that our Founders'
         determination to guarantee the preeminence of civil over military power was an important
         element that prompted adoption of the Constitutional Amendments we call the Bill of
         Rights." <p>The action in turning the "armies" loose on surveillance of civilians was a
            gross repudiation of our traditions. The military, though important to us, is
            subservient and restricted purely to military missions. It even took an Act of Congress
            to allow a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to address the Congress;<span class="sup"
               >[8]</span> and that small step did not go unnoticed but was in fact viewed with
            alarm by those respectful of the civilian tradition. Walter Lippmann has written that
            during World War II, he was asked to convey a message to Winston Churchill, while the
            latter was in Washington together with his chiefs of staff. It was desired that
            Churchill should permit his chiefs of staff to testify before Congress as to the proper
            strategy for waging the war. Lippmann explains, however, that he "never finished the
            message. For the old lion let out a roar <span class="star-pagination">*24</span>
            demanding to know why I was so ignorant of the British way of doing things that I could
            dare to suggest that a British general should address a parliamentary body.</p> "As I
         remember it, what he said was `I am the Minister of Defense and I, not the generals, will
         state the policy of His Majesty's government.' " The Intervention of the General,
         Washington Post, Apr. 27, 1967, Sec. A, p. 21, col. 1.<span class="sup">[9]</span>
         <p>The act of turning the military loose on civilians even if sanctioned by an Act of
            Congress, which it has not been, would raise serious and profound constitutional
            questions. Standing as it does only on brute power and Pentagon policy, it must be
            repudiated as a usurpation dangerous to the civil liberties on which free men are
            dependent. For, as Senator Sam Ervin has said, "this claim of an inherent executive
            branch power of investigation and surveillance on the basis of people's beliefs and
            attitudes may be more of a threat to our internal security than any enemies beyond our
            borders." Privacy and Government Investigations, 1971 U. Ill. L. F. 137, 153.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>The claim that respondents have no standing to challenge the Army's surveillance of them
            and the other members of the class they seek to represent is too transparent for serious
            argument. The surveillance of the Army over the civilian sector&#x97;a part of society
            hitherto immune from its control&#x97;is a serious charge. It is alleged that the Army
            maintains files on the membership, ideology, programs, and practices of virtually every
            activist political group in the country, including groups such as the Southern Christian
            Leadership Conference, Clergy <span class="star-pagination">*25</span> and Laymen United
            Against the War in Vietnam, the American Civil Liberties Union, Women's Strike for
            Peace, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The Army uses
            undercover agents to infiltrate these civilian groups and to reach into confidential
            files of students and other groups. The Army moves as a secret group among civilian
            audiences, using cameras and electronic ears for surveillance. The data it collects are
            distributed to civilian officials in state, federal, and local governments and to each
            military intelligence unit and troop command under the Army's jurisdiction (both here
            and abroad); and these data are stored in one or more data banks.</p>
         <p>Those are the allegations; and the charge is that the purpose and effect of the system
            of surveillance is to harass and intimidate the respondents and to deter them from
            exercising their rights of political expression, protest, and dissent "by invading their
            privacy, damaging their reputations, adversely affecting their employment and their
            opportunities for employment, and in other ways." Their fear is that "permanent reports
            of their activities will be maintained in the Army's data bank, and their `profiles'
            will appear in the so-called `Blacklist' and that all of this information will be
            released to numerous federal and state agencies upon request."</p>
         <p>Judge Wilkey, speaking for the Court of Appeals, properly inferred that this Army
            surveillance "exercises a present inhibiting effect on their full expression and
            utilization of their First Amendment rights." 144 U. S. App. D. C. 72, 79, 444 F. 2d
            947, 954. That is the test. The "deterrent effect" on First Amendment rights by
            government oversight marks an unconstitutional intrusion, Lamont v. Postmaster General,
            381 U. S. 301, 307. Or, as stated by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, "inhibition as well as
            prohibition against the exercise of precious First <span class="star-pagination"
               >*26</span> Amendment rights is a power denied to government." Id., at 309. When
            refusal of the Court to pass on the constitutionality of an Act under the normal
            consideration of forbearance "would itself have an inhibitory effect on freedom of
            speech" then the Court will act. United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 22.</p>
         <p>As stated by the Supreme Court of New Jersey, "there is good reason to permit the strong
            to speak for the weak or the timid in First Amendment matters." Anderson v. Sills, 56 N.
            J. 210, 220, 265 A. 2d 678, 684 (1970).</p>
         <p>One need not wait to sue until he loses his job or until his reputation is defamed. To
            withhold standing to sue until that time arrives would in practical effect immunize from
            judicial scrutiny all surveillance activities, regardless of their misuse and their
            deterrent effect. As stated in Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 101, "in terms of Article
            III limitations on federal court jurisdiction, the question of standing is related only
            to whether the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an adversary
            context and in a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution." Or, as we
            put it in Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 204, the gist of the standing issue is whether
            the party seeking relief has "alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the
            controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of
            issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult
            constitutional questions."</p>
         <p>The present controversy is not a remote, imaginary conflict. Respondents were targets of
            the Army's surveillance. First, the surveillance was not casual but massive and
            comprehensive. Second, the intelligence reports were regularly and widely circulated and
            were exchanged with reports of the FBI, state and municipal police departments, and the
            CIA. Third, the Army's <span class="star-pagination">*27</span> surveillance was not
            collecting material in public records but staking out teams of agents, infiltrating
            undercover agents, creating command posts inside meetings, posing as press photographers
            and newsmen, posing as TV newsmen, posing as students, and shadowing public figures.</p>
         <p>Finally, we know from the hearings conducted by Senator Ervin that the Army has misused
            or abused its reporting functions. Thus, Senator Ervin concluded that reports of the
            Army have been "taken from the Intelligence Command's highly inaccurate civil
            disturbance teletype and filed in Army dossiers on persons who have held, or were being
            considered for, security clearances, thus contaminating what are supposed to be
            investigative reports with unverified gossip and rumor. This practice directly
            jeopardized the employment and employment opportunities of persons seeking sensitive
            positions with the federal government or defense industry."<span class="sup">[10]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Surveillance of civilians is none of the Army's constitutional business and Congress has
            not undertaken to entrust it with any such function. The fact that since this litigation
            started the Army's surveillance may have been cut back is not an end of the matter.
            Whether there has been an actual cutback or whether the announcements are merely a ruse
            can be determined only after a hearing in the District Court. We are advised by an
            amicus curiae brief filed by a group of former Army Intelligence Agents that Army
            surveillance of civilians is rooted in secret programs of long standing:</p> "Army
         intelligence has been maintaining an unauthorized watch over civilian political activity
         for nearly 30 years. Nor is this the first time that <span class="star-pagination"
            >*28</span> Army intelligence has, without notice to its civilian superiors, overstepped
         its mission. From 1917 to 1924, the Corps of Intelligence Police maintained a massive
         surveillance of civilian political activity which involved the use of hundreds of civilian
         informants, the infiltration of civilian organizations and the seizure of dissenters and
         unionists, sometimes without charges. That activity was opposed&#x97; then as now&#x97;by
         civilian officials on those occasions when they found out about it, but it continued
         unabated until post-war disarmament and economies finally eliminated the bureaucracy that
         conducted it." Pp. 29-30. <p>This case involves a cancer in our body politic. It is a
            measure of the disease which afflicts us. Army surveillance, like Army regimentation, is
            at war with the principles of the First Amendment. Those who already walk submissively
            will say there is no cause for alarm. But submissiveness is not our heritage. The First
            Amendment was designed to allow rebellion to remain as our heritage. The Constitution
            was designed to keep government off the backs of the people. The Bill of Rights was
            added to keep the precincts of belief and expression, of the press, of political and
            social activities free from surveillance. The Bill of Rights was designed to keep agents
            of government and official eavesdroppers away from assemblies of people. The aim was to
            allow men to be free and independent and to assert their rights against government.
            There can be no influence more paralyzing of that objective than Army surveillance. When
            an intelligence officer looks over every nonconformist's shoulder in the library, or
            walks invisibly by his side in a picket line, or infiltrates his club, the America once
            extolled as the voice of liberty heard around the world no longer is <span
               class="star-pagination">*29</span> cast in the image which Jefferson and Madison
            designed, but more in the Russian image, depicted in Appendix III to this opinion.</p>

         <h2>APPENDIX I TO OPINION OF DOUGLAS, J., DISSENTING</h2>
         <p>The narrowly circumscribed domestic role which Congress has by statute authorized the
            Army to play is clearly an insufficient basis for the wholesale civilian surveillance of
            which respondents complain. The entire domestic mission of the armed services is
            delimited by nine statutes.</p>
         <p>Four define the Army's narrow role as a back-up for civilian authority where the latter
            has proved insufficient to cope with insurrection:</p>
         <p>10 U. S. C. § 331:</p>
         <p>"Whenever there is an insurrection in any State against its government, the President
            may, upon the request of its legislature or of its governor if the legislature cannot be
            convened, call into Federal service such of the militia of the other States, in the
            number requested by that State, and use such of the armed forces, as he considers
            necessary to suppress the insurrection."</p>
         <p>10 U. S. C. § 332:</p>
         <p>"Whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions, combinations, or
            assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States, make it
            impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States in any State or Territory by the
            ordinary course of judicial proceedings, he may call into Federal service such of the
            militia of any State, and use such of the armed forces, as he considers necessary to
            enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion."</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*30</span> 10 U. S. C. § 333:</p>
         <p>"The President, by using the militia or the armed forces, or both, or by any other
            means, shall take such measures as he considers necessary to suppress, in a State, any
            insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy, if it&#x97;</p>
         <p>"(1) so hinders the execution of the laws of that State, and of the United States within
            the State, that any part or class of its people is deprived of a right, privilege,
            immunity, or protection named in the Constitution and secured by law, and the
            constituted authorities of that State are unable, fail, or refuse to protect that right,
            privilege, or immunity, or to give that protection; or</p>
         <p>"(2) opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the
            course of justice under those laws.</p>
         <p>"In any situation covered by clause (1), the State shall be considered to have denied
            the equal protection of the laws secured by the Constitution."</p>
         <p>10 U. S. C. § 334:</p>
         <p>"Whenever the President considers it necessary to use the militia or the armed forces
            under this chapter, he shall, by proclamation, immediately order the insurgents to
            disperse and retire peaceably to their abodes within a limited time."</p>
         <p>Two statutes, passed as a result of Reconstruction Era military abuses, prohibit
            military interference in civilian elections:</p>
         <p>18 U. S. C. § 592:</p>
         <p>"Whoever, being an officer of the Army or Navy, or other person in the civil, military,
            or naval service of the United States, orders, brings, keeps, or has under his authority
            or control any troops or armed men at any place where a general or special election is
            held, unless such force be necessary to repel armed enemies of the <span
               class="star-pagination">*31</span> United States, shall be fined not more than $5,000
            or imprisoned not more than five years, or both; and be disqualified from holding any
            office of honor, profit, or trust under the United States.</p>
         <p>"This section shall not prevent any officer or member of the armed forces of the United
            States from exercising the right of suffrage in any election district to which he may
            belong, if otherwise qualified according to the laws of the State in which he offers to
            vote."</p>
         <p>18 U. S. C. § 593:</p>
         <p>"Whoever, being an officer or member of the Armed Forces of the United States,
            prescribes or fixes or attempts to prescribe or fix, whether by proclamation, order or
            otherwise, the qualifications of voters at any election in any State; or</p>
         <p>"Whoever, being such officer or member, prevents or attempts to prevent by force,
            threat, intimidation, advice or otherwise any qualified voter of any State from fully
            exercising the right of suffrage at any general or special election; or</p>
         <p>"Whoever, being such officer or member, orders or compels or attempts to compel any
            election officer in any State to receive a vote from a person not legally qualified to
            vote; or</p>
         <p>"Whoever, being such officer or member, imposes or attempts to impose any regulations
            for conducting any general or special election in a State, different from those
            prescribed by law; or</p>
         <p>"Whoever, being such officer or member, interferes in any manner with an election
            officer's discharge of his duties&#x97;</p>
         <p>"Shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both;
            and disqualified from holding any office of honor, profit or trust under the United
            States.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*32</span> "This section shall not prevent any officer or
            member of the Armed Forces from exercising the right of suffrage in any district to
            which he may belong, if otherwise qualified according to the laws of the State of such
            district."</p>
         <p>Another Reconstruction Era statute forbids the use of military troops as a posse
            comitatus:</p>
         <p>18 U. S. C. § 1385:</p>
         <p>"Whoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the
            Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the Army or the Air Force as
            a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined not more than $10,000
            or imprisoned not more than two years, or both."</p>
         <p>Finally, there are two specialized statutes. It was thought necessary to pass an Act of
            Congress to give the armed services some limited power to control prostitution near
            military bases, and an Act of Congress was required to enable a member of the Joint
            Chiefs of Staff to testify before Congress:</p>
         <p>18 U. S. C. § 1384:</p>
         <p>"Within such reasonable distance of any military or naval camp, station, fort, post,
            yard, base, cantonment, training or mobilization place as the Secretary of the Army, the
            Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Air Force, or any two or all of them shall
            determine to be needful to the efficiency, health, and welfare of the Army, the Navy, or
            the Air Force, and shall designate and publish in general orders or bulletins, whoever
            engages in prostitution or aids or abets prostitution or procures or solicits for
            purposes of prostitution, or keeps or sets up a house of ill fame, brothel, or bawdy
            house, or receives any person for purposes of lewdness, assignation, or prostitution
            into any vehicle, conveyance, place, structure, or building, or permits any person to
            remain for <span class="star-pagination">*33</span> the purpose of lewdness,
            assignation, or prostitution in any vehicle, conveyance, place, structure, or building
            or leases or rents or contracts to lease or rent any vehicle, conveyance, place,
            structure or building, or part thereof, knowing or with good reason to know that it is
            intended to be used for any of the purposes herein prohibited shall be fined not more
            than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.</p>
         <p>"The Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and the Federal Security Administrator
            shall take such steps as they deem necessary to suppress and prevent such violations
            thereof, and shall accept the cooperation of the authorities of States and their
            counties, districts, and other political subdivisions in carrying out the purpose of
            this section.</p>
         <p>"This section shall not be construed as conferring on the personnel of the Departments
            of the Army, Navy, or Air Force or the Federal Security Agency any authority to make
            criminal investigations, searches, seizures, or arrests of civilians charged with
            violations of this section."</p>
         <p>10 U. S. C. § 141 (e):</p>
         <p>"After first informing the Secretary of Defense, a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
            may make such recommendations to Congress relating to the Department of Defense as he
            may consider appropriate."</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>APPENDIX II TO OPINION OF DOUGLAS, J., DISSENTING</h2>
         <p>Walter Lippmann gave the following account of his conversation with Churchill:</p> "The
         President's bringing Gen. Westmoreland home in order to explain the war reminds me of an
         instructive afternoon spent during the Second World War. The country and the Congress were
         divided on the question of whether to strike first against <span class="star-pagination"
            >*34</span> Hitler or first against Japan. Churchill and Roosevelt had agreed on the
         policy of Hitler first. But there were large and powerful groups in the country, many of
         them former isolationists in the sense that they were anti-European, who wanted to
         concentrate American forces on winning the war against Japan. Even the American chiefs of
         staff were divided on this question of high strategy. "Churchill had come to Washington,
         accompanied by the British chiefs of staff, to work out with President Roosevelt and the
         Administration the general plan of the global war. One morning I had a telephone call from
         Sen. Austin, who was a strong believer in the Churchill-Roosevelt line. He said in effect,
         `I know you are seeing the Prime Minister this afternoon and I wish you would ask him to
         tell his chiefs of staff to come to Congress and testify in favor of our strategical
         policy.' Quite innocently I said I would do this, and when Churchill received me that
         afternoon I began by saying that I had a message from Sen. Austin. `Would the Prime
         Minister instruct his chiefs of staff to go to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . . .
         .' I never finished the message. For the old lion let out a roar demanding to know why I
         was so ignorant of the British way of doing things that I could dare to suggest that a
         British general should address a parliamentary body. "As I remember it, what he said was,
         `I am the Minister of Defense and I, not the generals, will state the policy of His
         Majesty's government.' "No one who ever aroused the wrath of Churchill is likely to forget
         it. I certainly have not forgotten it. I learned an indelible lesson about one of the
         elementary principles of democratic government. And therefore, I take a very sour view of a
         field <span class="star-pagination">*35</span> commander being brought home by the
         President to educate the Congress and the American people." <p>Our military added political
            departments to their staffs. A Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, Military Policy
            Division, was first established in the Department of the Navy by President Truman in
            1945. In the Office of Secretary of Defense that was done by President Truman in 1947,
            the appointee eventually becoming Assistant Secretary for International Security
            Affairs. A like office was established in 1961 in the Department of the Army by
            President Kennedy and another for the Air Force in 1957 by President Eisenhower. Thus,
            when the Pentagon entered a Washington, D. C., conference, its four "Secretaries of
            State" faced the real Secretary of State and more frequently than not talked or stared
            him down. The Pentagon's "Secretaries of State" usually spoke in unison; they were clear
            and decisive with no ifs, ands, or buts, and in policy conferences usually carried the
            day.</p>
         <p>By 1968 the Pentagon was spending $34 million a year on non-military social and
            behavioral science research both at home and abroad. One related to "witchcraft,
            sorcery, magic, and other psychological phenomena" in the Congo. Another concerned the
            "political influence of university students in Latin America." Other projects related to
            the skill of Korean women as divers, snake venoms in the Middle East, and the like.
            Research projects were going on for the Pentagon in 40 countries in sociology,
            psychology and behavioral sciences.</p>
         <p>The Pentagon became so powerful that no President would dare crack down on it and try to
            regulate it.</p>
         <p>The military approach to world affairs conditioned our thinking and our planning after
            World War II.</p>
         <p>We did not realize that to millions of these people there was no difference between a
            Communist dictatorship <span class="star-pagination">*36</span> and the dictatorship
            under which they presently lived. We did not realize that in some regions of Asia it was
            the Communist party that identified itself with the so-called reform programs, the other
            parties being mere instruments for keeping a ruling class in power. We did not realize
            that, in the eyes of millions of illiterates, the choice between democracy and communism
            was not the critical choice it would be for us.</p>
         <p>We talked about "saving democracy." But the real question in Asia, the Middle East,
            Africa, and Latin America was whether democracy would ever be born.</p>
         <p>We forgot that democracy in most lands is an empty word. We asked illiterate people
            living at the subsistence level to furnish staging grounds for a military operation
            whose outcome, in their eyes, had no relation to their own welfare. Those who rejected
            our overtures must be communists, we said. Those who did not approve our military plans
            must be secretly aligning with Russia, we thought.</p>
         <p>So it was that in underdeveloped areas we became identified not with ideas of freedom,
            but with bombs, planes, and tanks. We thought less and less in terms of defeating
            communism with programs of political action, more and more in terms of defeating
            communism with military might. Our foreign aid mounted; but nearly 70% of it was
            military aid.</p>
         <p>Our fears mounted as the cold war increased in intensity. These fears had many
            manifestations. The communist threat inside the country was magnified and exalted far
            beyond its realities. Irresponsible talk fanned the flames. Accusations were loosely
            made. Character assassinations were common. Suspicion took the place of goodwill. We
            needed to debate with impunity and explore to the edges of problems. We needed to search
            to the horizon for answers to perplexing problems. We needed confidence in each other.
            But in the <span class="star-pagination">*37</span> 40's, 50's, and 60's suspicions
            grew. Innocent acts became telltale marks of disloyalty. The coincidence that an idea
            paralleled Soviet Russia's policy for a moment of time settled an aura of doubt around a
            person. The Intervention of the General, Washington Post, Apr. 27, 1967, Sec. A, p. 21,

         <p/>
         <h2>APPENDIX III TO OPINION OF DOUGLAS, J., DISSENTING</h2>
         <p>Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn, the noted Soviet author, made the following statement March
            30, 1972, concerning surveillance of him and his family (reported in the Washington
            Post, Apr. 3, 1972):</p>
         <p>"A kind of forbidden, contaminated zone has been created around my family, and to this
            day, there are people in Ryazan [where Solzhenitsyn used to live] who were dismissed
            from their jobs for having visited my house a few years ago. A corresponding member of
            the Academy of Sciences, T. Timofeyev, who is director of a Moscow institute, became so
            scared when he found out that a mathematician working under him was my wife that he
            dismissed her with unseemly haste, although this was just after she had given birth and
            contrary to all laws . . .</p>
         <p>"It happens that an informant [for his new book on the history of prerevolutionary
            Russia] may meet with me. We work an hour or two and as soon as he leaves my house, he
            will be closely followed, as if he were a state criminal, and they will investigate his
            background, and then go on to find out who this man meets, and then, in turn, who that
            [next] person is meeting.</p>
         <p>"Of course they cannot do this with everyone. The state security people have their
            schedule, and their own profound reasoning. On some days, there is no surveillance at
            all, or only superficial surveillance. On other days, they hang around, for example when
            Heinrich Boll <span class="star-pagination">*38</span> came to see me [he is a German
            writer who recently visited Moscow]. They will put a car in front of each of the two
            approaches [to the courtyard of the apartment house where he stays in Moscow] with three
            men in each car&#x97;and they don't work only one shift. Then off they go after my
            visitors, or they trail people who leave on foot.</p>
         <p>"And if you consider that they listen around the clock to telephone conversations and
            conversations in my home, they analyze recording tapes and all correspondence, and then
            collect and compare all these data in some vast premises&#x97;and these people are not
            underlings&#x97;you cannot but be amazed that so many idlers in the prime of life and
            strength, who could be better occupied with productive work for the benefit of the
            fatherland, are busy with my friends and me, and keep inventing enemies."</p>

      <div type="dissent" judge="brennan">
         <p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join,
            dissenting.</p>
         <p>The Court of Appeals held that a justiciable controversy exists and that respondents
            have stated a claim upon which relief could be granted. 144 U. S. App. D. C. 72, 83, 444
            F. 2d 947, 958 (1971). I agree with Judge Wilkey, writing for the Court of Appeals, that
            this conclusion is compelled for the following reasons stated by him:</p> "[Respondents]
         contend that the present existence of this system of gathering and distributing
         information, allegedly far beyond the mission requirements of the Army, constitutes an
         impermissible burden on [respondents] and other persons similarly situated which exercises
         a present inhibiting effect on their full expression and utilization of their First
         Amendment rights of free speech, etc. The baleful effect, if there is one, is thus a
         present <span class="star-pagination">*39</span> inhibition of lawful behavior and of First
         Amendment rights. "Under this view of [respondents'] allegations, under justiciability
         standards it is the operation of the system itself which is the breach of the Army's duty
         toward [respondents] and other civilians. The case is therefore ripe for adjudication.
         Because the evil alleged in the Army intelligence system is that of overbreadth, i. e., the
         collection of information not reasonably relevant to the Army's mission to suppress civil
         disorder, and because there is no indication that a better opportunity will later arise to
         test the constitutionality of the Army's action, the issue can be considered justiciable at
         this time." Id., at 79-81, 444 F. 2d, at 954-956 (emphasis in original) (footnotes
         omitted). "To the extent that the Army's argument against justiciability here includes the
         claim that [respondents] lack standing to bring this action, we cannot agree. If the Army's
         system does indeed derogate First Amendment values, the [respondents] are persons who are
         sufficiently affected to permit their complaint to be heard. The record shows that most if
         not all of the [respondents] and/or the organizations of which they are members have been
         the subject of Army surveillance reports and their names have appeared in the Army's
         records. Since this is precisely the injury of which [respondents] complain, they have
         standing to seek redress for that alleged injury in court and will provide the necessary
         adversary interest that is required by the standing doctrine, on the issue of whether the
         actions complained of do in fact inhibit the exercise of First Amendment rights. Nor should
         the fact that <span class="star-pagination">*40</span> these particular persons are
         sufficiently uninhibited to bring this suit be any ground for objecting to their standing."
         Id., at 79 n. 17, 444 F. 2d, at 954 n. 17. <p>Respondents may or may not be able to prove
            the case they allege. But I agree with the Court of Appeals that they are entitled to
            try. I would therefore affirm the remand to the District Court for a trial and
            determination of the issues specified by the Court of Appeals.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="notes">
         <p>[1] The complaint filed in the District Court candidly asserted that its factual
            allegations were based on a magazine article: "The information contained in the
            foregoing paragraphs numbered five through thirteen [of the complaint] was published in
            the January 1970 issue of the magazine The Washington Monthly . . . ."</p>
         <p>[2] "Whenever there is an insurrection in any State against its government, the
            President may, upon the request of its legislature or of its governor if the legislature
            cannot be convened, call into Federal service such of the militia of the other States,
            in the number requested by that State, and use such of the armed forces, as he considers
            necessary to suppress the insurrection." </p>
         <p>The constitutionality of this statute is not at issue here; the specific authorization
            of such use of federal armed forces, in addition to state militia, appears to have been
            enacted pursuant to Art. IV, § 4, of the Constitution, which provides that "[t]he United
            States . . . shall protect each of [the individual States] . . . on Application of the
            Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against
            domestic Violence."</p>
         <p>In describing the requirement of 10 U. S. C. § 331 for the use of federal troops to
            quell domestic disorders, Attorney General Ramsey Clark made the following statements in
            a letter sent to all state governors on August 7, 1967:</p>
         <p>"There are three basic prerequisites to the use of Federal troops in a state in the
            event of domestic violence:</p>
         <p>"(1) That a situation of serious `domestic violence' exists within the state. While this
            conclusion should be supported with a statement of factual details to the extent
            feasible under the circumstances, there is no prescribed wording.</p>
         <p>"(2) That such violence cannot be brought under control by the law enforcement resources
            available to the governor, including local and State police forces and the National
            Guard. The judgment required here is that there is a definite need for the assistance of
            Federal troops, taking into account the remaining time needed to move them into action
            at the scene of violence.</p>
         <p>"(3) That the legislature or the governor requests the President to employ the armed
            forces to bring the violence under control. The element of request by the governor of a
            State is essential if the legislature cannot be convened. It may be difficult in the
            context of urban rioting, such as we have seen this summer, to convene the
            legislature.</p>
         <p>"These three elements should be expressed in a written communication to the President,
            which of course may be a telegram, to support his issuance of a proclamation under 10 U.
            S. C. § 334 and commitment of troops to action. In case of extreme emergency, receipt of
            a written request will not be a prerequisite to Presidential action. However, since it
            takes several hours to alert and move Federal troops, the few minutes needed to write
            and dispatch a telegram are not likely to cause any delay.</p>
         <p>"Upon receiving the request from a governor the President, under the terms of the
            statute and the historic practice, must exercise his own judgment as to whether Federal
            troops will be sent, and as to such questions as timing, size of the force, and
            federalization of the National Guard.</p>
         <p>"Preliminary steps, such as alerting the troops, can be taken by the Federal government
            upon oral communications and prior to the governor's determination that the violence
            cannot be brought under control without the aid of Federal forces. Even such preliminary
            steps, however, represent a most serious departure from our traditions of local
            responsibility for law enforcement. They should not be requested until there is a
            substantial likelihood that the Federal forces will be needed."</p>
         <p>This analysis of Attorney General Clark suggests the importance of the need for
            information to guide the intelligent use of military forces and to avoid "overkill."</p>
         <p>[3] Translated in terms of personnel, this percentage figure suggests that the total
            intelligence operation concerned with potential civil disorders hardly merits
            description as "massive," as one of the dissents characterizes it.</p>
         <p>[4] That principal mission was described in one of the documents filed with the District
            Court as the conducting of "investigations to determine whether uniformed members of the
            Army, civilian employees [of the Army] and contractors' employees should be granted
            access to classified information." App. 76-77.</p>
         <p>[5] In the course of the oral argument, the District Judge sought clarification from
            respondents' counsel as to the nature of the threats perceived by respondents; he asked
            what exactly it was in the Army's activities that tended to chill respondents and others
            in the exercise of their constitutional rights. Counsel responded that it was </p>
         <p>"precisely the threat in this case that in some future civil disorder of some kind, the
            Army is going to come in with its list of troublemakers. . . and go rounding up people
            and putting them in military prisons somewhere." (Emphasis added.)</p>
         <p>To this the court responded that "we still sit here with the writ of habeas corpus." At
            another point, counsel for respondents took a somewhat different approach in arguing
            that</p>
         <p>"we're not quite sure exactly what they have in mind and that is precisely what causes
            the chill, the chilling effect." (Emphasis added.)</p>
         <p>[6] Indeed, the Court of Appeals noted that it had reached a different conclusion when
            presented with a virtually identical issue in another of its recently decided cases,
            Davis v. Ichord, 143 U. S. App. D. C. 183, 442 F. 2d 1207 (1970). The plaintiffs in
            Davis were attacking the constitutionality of the House of Representatives Rule under
            which the House Committee on Internal Security conducts investigations and maintains
            files described by the plaintiffs as a "political blacklist." The court noted that any
            chilling effect to which the plaintiffs were subject arose from the mere existence of
            the Committee and its files and the mere possibility of the misuse of those files. In
            affirming the dismissal of the complaint, the court concluded that allegations of such a
            chilling effect could not be elevated to a justiciable claim merely by alleging as well
            that the challenged House Rule was overly broad and vague. </p>
         <p>In deciding the case presently under review, the Court of Appeals distinguished Davis on
            the ground that the difference in the source of the chill in the two cases&#x97;a House
            Committee in Davis and the Army in the instant case&#x97;was controlling. We cannot
            agree that the jurisdictional question with which we are here concerned is to be
            resolved on the basis of the identity of the parties named as defendants in the
            complaint.</p>
         <p>[7] Not only have respondents left somewhat unclear the precise connection between the
            mere existence of the challenged system and their own alleged chill, but they have also
            cast considerable doubt on whether they themselves are in fact suffering from any such
            chill. Judge MacKinnon took cogent note of this difficulty in dissenting from the Court
            of Appeals' judgment, rendered as it was "on the facts of the case which emerge from the
            pleadings, affidavits and the admissions made to the trial court." 144 U. S. App. D. C.,
            at 84, 444 F. 2d, at 959. At the oral argument before the District Court, counsel for
            respondents admitted that his clients were "not people, obviously, who are cowed and
            chilled"; indeed, they were quite willing "to open themselves up to public investigation
            and public scrutiny." But, counsel argued, these respondents must "represent millions of
            Americans not nearly as forward [and] courageous" as themselves. It was Judge
            MacKinnon's view that this concession "constitutes a basic denial of practically their
            whole case." Ibid. Even assuming a justiciable controversy, if respondents themselves
            are not chilled, but seek only to represent those "millions" whom they believe are so
            chilled, respondents clearly lack that "personal stake in the outcome of the
            controversy" essential to standing. Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 204 (1962). As the
            Court recently observed in Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U. S. 163, 166, a litigant
            "has standing to seek redress for injuries done to him, but may not seek redress for
            injuries done to others."</p>

         <p>[4] Even some actions of the Armed Services in regulating their own conduct may be
            properly subjected to judicial scrutiny. Those who are not yet in the Armed Services
            have the protection of the full panoply of the laws governing admission procedures, see,
            e. g., McKart v. United States, 395 U. S. 185; Oestereich v. Selective Service Board,
            393 U. S. 233. Those in the service may use habeas corpus to test the jurisdiction of
            the Armed Services to try or detain them, see, e. g., Parisi v. Davidson, 405 U. S. 34;
            Noyd v. Bond, 395 U. S. 683, 696 n. 8; Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1; Billings v.
            Truesdell, 321 U. S. 542. And, those in the Armed Services may seek the protection of
            civilian, rather than military, courts when charged with crimes not service connected,
