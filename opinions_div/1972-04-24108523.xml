         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*93</span> MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of
            the Court.</p>
         <p>This is a motion by Illinois to file a bill of complaint under our original jurisdiction
            against four cities of Wisconsin, the Sewerage Commission of the City of Milwaukee, and
            the Metropolitan Sewerage Commission of the County of Milwaukee. The cause of action
            alleged is pollution by the defendants of Lake Michigan, a body of interstate water.
            According to plaintiff, some 200 million gallons of raw or inadequately treated sewage
            and other waste materials are discharged daily into the lake in the Milwaukee area
            alone. Plaintiff alleges that it and its subdivisions prohibit and prevent such
            discharges, but that the defendants do not take such actions. Plaintiff asks that we
            abate this public nuisance.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>Article III, ยง 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution provides: "In all Cases . . . in which a
            State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction." Congress has
            provided in 28 U. S. C. ยง 1251 that "(a) the Supreme Court shall have original and
            exclusive jurisdiction of: (1) All controversies between two or more States."</p>
         <p>It has long been this Court's philosophy that "our original jurisdiction should be
            invoked sparingly." Utah v. United States, 394 U. S. 89, 95. We construe 28 U. S. C. ยง
            1251 (a) (1), as we do Art. III, ยง 2, cl. 2, to honor our original jurisdiction but to
            make it obligatory only in appropriate cases. And the question of what is appropriate
            concerns, of course, the seriousness and dignity of the claim; yet beyond that it
            necessarily involves the availability of another forum where there is jurisdiction over
            the named parties, where the issues tendered may be litigated, and where appropriate
            relief may be had. We <span class="star-pagination">*94</span> incline to a sparing use
            of our original jurisdiction so that our increasing duties with the appellate docket
            will not suffer. Washington v. General Motors Corp., post, p. 109.</p>
         <p>Illinois presses its request for leave to file saying that the agencies named as
            defendants are instrumentalities of Wisconsin and therefore that this is a suit against
            Wisconsin which could not be brought in any other forum.</p>
         <p>Under our decisions there is no doubt that the actions of public entities might, under
            appropriate pleadings, be attributed to a State so as to warrant a joinder of the State
            as party defendant.</p>
         <p>In Missouri v. Illinois, 180 U. S. 208, Missouri invoked our original jurisdiction by an
            action against the State of Illinois and the Sanitary District of the City of Chicago,
            seeking an injunction to restrain the discharge of raw sewage into the Mississippi
            River. On a demurrer to the motion for leave to file a bill of complaint, Illinois
            argued that the Sanitary District was the proper defendant and that Illinois should not
            have been made a party. That argument was rejected:</p> "The contention . . . seems to
         be that, because the matters complained of in the bill proceed and will continue to proceed
         from the acts of the Sanitary District of Chicago, a corporation of the State of Illinois,
         it therefore follows that the State, as such, is not interested in the question, and is
         improperly made a party. "We are unable to see the force of this suggestion. The bill does
         not allege that the Sanitary District is acting without or in excess of lawful authority.
         The averment and the conceded facts are that the corporation is an agency of the State to
         do the very things which, according to the theory of the complainant's case, will result in
         the mischief to be apprehended. <span class="star-pagination">*95</span> It is state action
         and its results that are complained of&#x97;thus distinguishing this case from that of
         Louisiana v. Texas [176 U. S.1], where the acts sought to be restrained were alleged to be
         those of officers or functionaries proceeding in a wrongful and malevolent misapplication
         of the quarantine laws of Texas. The Sanitary District of Chicago is not a private
         corporation, formed for purposes of private gain, but a public corporation, whose existence
         and operations are wholly within the control of the State. "The object of the bill is to
         subject this public work to judicial supervision, upon the allegation that the method of
         its construction and maintenance will create a continuing nuisance, dangerous to the health
         of a neighboring State and its inhabitants. Surely, in such a case, the State of Illinois
         would have a right to appear and traverse the allegations of the bill, and, having such a
         right, might properly be made a party defendant." 180 U. S., at 242. <p>In New York v. New
            Jersey, 256 U. S. 296, the State of New York brought an original action against the
            State of New Jersey and the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commissioners, seeking an injunction
            against the discharge of sewage into Upper New York Bay. The question was whether the
            actions of the sewage agency could be attributed to New Jersey so as to make that State
            responsible for them. The Court said:</p> "Also, for the purpose of showing the
         responsibility of the State of New Jersey for the proposed action of the defendant, the
         Passaic Valley Sewerage Commissioners, the bill sets out, with much detail, the acts of the
         legislature of that State authorizing and directing such action on their part. <span
            class="star-pagination">*96</span> "Of this it is sufficient to say that the averments
         of the bill, quite undenied, show that the defendant sewerage commissioners constitute such
         a statutory, corporate agency of the State that their action, actual or intended, must be
         treated as that of the State itself, and we shall so regard it." 256 U. S., at 302. <p>The
            most recent case is New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S. 369. The action was originally
            brought by the State of New Jersey against the City and State of New York for injunctive
            relief against the diversion of waters from Delaware River tributaries lying within New
            York State. Pennsylvania was subsequently allowed to intervene. The question presented
            by this decision was the right of the City of Philadelphia also to intervene in the
            proceedings as a party plaintiff. The issues raised were broad:</p> "All of the present
         parties to the litigation have formally opposed the motion to intervene on grounds (1) that
         the intervention would permit a suit against a state by a citizen of another state in
         contravention of the Eleventh Amendment; (2) that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has the
         exclusive right to represent the interest of Philadelphia as parens patriae; and (3) that
         intervention should be denied, in any event, as a matter of sound discretion." 345 U. S.,
         at 372. <p>We denied the City of Philadelphia's motion to intervene, saying:</p> "The City
         of Philadelphia represents only a part of the citizens of Pennsylvania who reside in the
         watershed area of the Delaware River and its tributaries and depend upon those waters. If
         we undertook to evaluate all the separate interests within Pennsylvania, we could, in
         effect, be drawn into an <span class="star-pagination">*97</span> intramural dispute over
         the distribution of water within the Commonwealth. . . . "Our original jurisdiction should
         not be thus expanded to the dimensions of ordinary class actions. An intervenor whose state
         is already a party should have the burden of showing some compelling interest in his own
         right, apart from his interest in a class with all other citizens and creatures of the
         state, which interest is not properly represented by the state." 345 U. S., at 373. <p>We
            added:</p> "The presence of New York City in this litigation is urged as a reason for
         permitting Philadelphia to intervene. But the argument misconstrues New York City's
         position in the case. New York City was not admitted into this litigation as a matter of
         discretion at her request. She was forcibly joined as a defendant to the original action
         since she was the authorized agent for the execution of the sovereign policy which

            conclude that while, under appropriate pleadings, Wisconsin could be joined as a
            defendant in the present controversy, it is not mandatory that it be made one.</p>
         <p>It is well settled that for the purposes of diversity of citizenship, political
            subdivisions are citizens of their respective States.<span class="sup">[1]</span>Bullard

            would make no jurisdictional difference whether it was the plaintiff or defendant in
            such an action. That being the case, a political subdivision in one State would be able
            to bring an action founded upon diversity jurisdiction against a political subdivision
            of another State.</p>
         <p>We therefore conclude that the term "States" as used in 28 U. S. C. ยง 1251 (a) (1)
            should not be read to include their political subdivisions. That, of course, does not
            mean that political subdivisions of a State may not be sued under the head of our
            original jurisdiction, for 28 U. S. C. ยง 1251 provides that "(b) the Supreme Court shall
            have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of: (3) all actions or proceedings by a
            State against the citizens of another State . . . ."</p>
         <p>If the named public entities of Wisconsin may, however, be sued by Illinois in a federal

         <p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, speaking for the four members of this Court in Romero v.
            International Terminal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354, 393 (dissenting and concurring),
            who reached the issue, concluded that "laws," within the meaning of ยง 1331 (a), embraced
            claims founded on federal common law:</p> "The contention cannot be accepted that since
         petitioner's rights are judicially defined, they are not created by `the laws . . . of the
         United States' within the meaning of ยง 1331 . . . . In another context, that of state law,
         this Court has recognized that the statutory word `laws' includes court decisions. The
         converse situation is presented here in that federal courts have an extensive
         responsibility of fashioning rules of substantive law . . . . These rules are as fully
         `laws' of the United States as if they had been enacted by Congress.' (Citations omitted.)
            <p>Lower courts have reached the same conclusion. See, e. g., Murphy v. Colonial Federal
            Savings &amp;amp; Loan Assn., 388 F. 2d 609, 611-612 (CA2 1967); Stokes v. Adair, 265 F.

            (1969).</p>
         <p>Judge Harvey M. Johnsen in Texas v. Pankey, 441 F. 2d 236, 240, stated the controlling
            principle:</p> "As the field of federal common law has been given necessary expansion
         into matters of federal concern and relationship (where no applicable federal <span
            class="star-pagination">*100</span> statute exists, as there does not here), the
         ecological rights of a State in the improper impairment of them from sources outside the
         State's own territory, now would and should, we think, be held to be a matter having basis
         and standard in federal common law and so directly constituting a question arising under
         the laws of the United States." <p>Chief Judge Lumbard, speaking for the panel in Ivy
            Broadcasting Co. v. American Tel. &amp;amp; Tel. Co., 391 F. 2d 486, 492, expressed the
            same view as follows:</p> "We believe that a cause of action similarly `arises under'
         federal law if the dispositive issues stated in the complaint require the application of
         federal common law . . . . The word `laws' in ยง 1331 should be construed to include laws
         created by federal judicial decisions as well as by congressional legislation. The
         rationale of the 1875 grant of federal question jurisdiction&#x97;to insure the
         availability of a forum designed to minimize the danger of hostility toward, and specially
         suited to the vindication of, federally created rights&#x97;is as applicable to judicially
         created rights as to rights created by statute." (Citations omitted.) <p>We see no reason
            not to give "laws" its natural meaning, see Romero v. International Terminal Operating
            Co., supra, at 393 n. 5 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting and concurring), and therefore conclude
            that ยง 1331 jurisdiction will support claims founded upon federal common law as well as
            those of a statutory origin.</p>
         <p>As respects the power of a State to bring an action under ยง 1331 (a), Ames v. Kansas,
            111 U. S. 449, 470-472, is controlling. There Kansas had sued a number of corporations
            in its own courts and, since federal rights were involved, the defendants had the cases
            removed to the federal court. Kansas resisted, saying that the federal court lacked
            jurisdiction because of Art. III, <span class="star-pagination">*101</span> ยง 2, cl. 2,
            of the Constitution, which gives this Court "original Jurisdiction" in "all Cases . . .
            in which a State shall be Party." The Court held that where a State is suing parties who
            are not other States, the original jurisdiction of this Court is not exclusive (id., at
            470) and that those suits "may now be brought in or removed to the Circuit Courts [now
            the District Courts] without regard to the character of the parties."<span class="sup"

         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>Congress has enacted numerous laws touching interstate waters. In 1899 it established
            some surveillance by the Army Corps of Engineers over industrial pollution, not
            including sewage, Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899, 30 Stat. 1121, a grant of
            power which we construed in United States v. Republic Steel Corp., 362 U. S. 482, and in
            United States v. Standard Oil Co., 384 U. S. 224.</p>
         <p>The 1899 Act has been reinforced and broadened by a complex of laws recently enacted.
            The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 62 Stat. 1155, as amended, 33 U. S. C. ยง 1151,
            tightens control over discharges into navigable waters so as not to lower applicable
            water quality standards. By the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 83 Stat. 852,
            42 U. S. C. ยง 4321 et seq., Congress "authorizes and directs" that "the policies,
            regulations, and public laws of the United States shall be interpreted and administered
            in accordance with the policies set forth in this Act" and that "all agencies of the
            Federal Government shall . . . identify and develop methods and procedures . . . which
            will insure that presently unquantified environmental amenities and values <span
               class="star-pagination">*102</span> may be given appropriate consideration in
            decisionmaking along with economic and technical considerations." Sec. 102, 42 U. S. C.
            ยง 4332. Congress has evinced increasing concern with the quality of the aquatic
            environment as it affects the conservation and safeguarding of fish and wildlife
            resources. See, e. g., Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956, 70 Stat. 1119, 16 U. S. C. ยง 742a;
            the Act of Sept. 22, 1959, 73 Stat. 642, authorizing research in migratory marine game
            fish, 16 U. S. C. ยง 760e; and the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, 48 Stat. 401, as
            amended, 16 U. S. C. ยง 661.</p>
         <p>Buttressed by these new and expanding policies, the Corps of Engineers has issued new
            Rules and Regulations governing permits for discharges or deposits into navigable
            waters. 36 Fed. Reg. 6564 et seq.</p>
         <p>The Federal Water Pollution Control Act in ยง 1 (b) declares that it is federal policy
            "to recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of the
            States in preventing and controlling water pollution." But the Act makes clear that it
            is federal, not state, law that in the end controls the pollution of interstate or
            navigable waters.<span class="sup">[3]</span> While the States are given time to
            establish water quality standards, ยง 10 (c) (1), if a State fails to do so the federal
               administrator<span class="sup">[4]</span> promulgates one. ยง 10 (c) (2). Section 10
            (a) makes pollution of interstate or navigable waters subject "to abatement" when it
            "endangers the health or welfare of any persons." <span class="star-pagination"
               >*103</span> The abatement that is authorized follows a long-drawn-out procedure
            unnecessary to relate here. It uses the conference procedure, hoping for amicable
            settlements. But if none is reached, the federal administrator may request the Attorney
            General to bring suit on behalf of the United States for abatement of the pollution. ยง
            10 (g).</p>
         <p>The remedy sought by Illinois is not within the precise scope of remedies prescribed by
            Congress. Yet the remedies which Congress provides are not necessarily the only federal
            remedies available. "It is not uncommon for federal courts to fashion federal law where
            federal rights are concerned." Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U. S. 448, 457.
            When we deal with air and water in their ambient or interstate aspects, there is a
            federal common law,<span class="sup">[5]</span> as Texas v. Pankey, 441 F. 2d 236,
            recently held.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*104</span> The application of federal common law to abate
            a public nuisance in interstate or navigable waters is not inconsistent with the Water
            Pollution Control Act. Congress provided in ยง 10 (b) of that Act that, save as a court
            may decree otherwise in an enforcement action, "[s]tate and interstate action to abate
            pollution of interstate or navigable waters shall be encouraged and shall not . . . be
            displaced by Federal enforcement action."</p>
         <p>The leading air case is Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., 206 U. S. 230, where Georgia
            filed an original suit in this Court against a Tennessee company whose noxious gases
            were causing a wholesale destruction of forests, orchards, and crops in Georgia. The
            Court said:</p> "The caution with which demands of this sort, on the part of a State,
         for relief from injuries analogous to torts, must be examined, is dwelt upon in Missouri v.
         Illinois, 200 U. S. 496, 520, 521. But it is plain that some such demands must be
         recognized, if the grounds alleged are proved. When the States by their union made the
         forcible abatement of outside nuisances impossible to each, they did not thereby agree to
         submit to whatever might be done. They did not renounce the possibility of making
         reasonable demands on the ground of their still remaining quasi-sovereign interests; and
         the alternative to force is a suit in this court. Missouri v. Illinois, 180 U. S. 208,
         241." 206 U. S., at 237. <p>The nature of the nuisance was described as follows:</p> "It is
         a fair and reasonable demand on the part of a sovereign that the air over its territory
         should not be polluted on a great scale by sulphurous acid gas, that the forests on its
         mountains, be they better or worse, and whatever domestic destruction they have suffered,
         should not be further destroyed or threatened by the act of persons beyond its control,
         that <span class="star-pagination">*105</span> the crops and orchards on its hills should
         not be endangered from the same source. If any such demand is to be enforced this must be,
         notwithstanding the hesitation that we might feel if the suit were between private parties,
         and the doubt whether for the injuries which they might be suffering to their property they
         should not be left to an action at law." Id., at 238. <p>Our decisions concerning
            interstate waters contain the same theme. Rights in interstate streams, like questions
            of boundaries, "have been recognized as presenting federal questions."<span class="sup"
               >[6]</span>Hinderlider v. La Plata Co., 304 U. S. 92, 110. The question of
            apportionment of interstate waters is a question of "federal common law" upon which
            state statutes or decisions are not conclusive.<span class="sup">[7]</span>Ibid.</p>
         <p>In speaking of the problem of apportioning the waters of an interstate stream, the Court
            said in Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U. S. 46, 98, that "through these successive disputes
            and decisions this court is practically building up what may not improperly be called
            interstate common <span class="star-pagination">*106</span> law." And see Texas v. New
            Jersey, 379 U. S. 674 (escheat of intangible personal property), Texas v. Florida, 306
            U. S. 398, 405 (suit by bill in the nature of interpleader to determine the true
            domicile of a decedent as the basis of death taxes).</p>
         <p>Equitable apportionment of the waters of an interstate stream has often been made under
            the head of our original jurisdiction. Nebraska v. Wyoming 325 U. S. 589; Kansas v.
            Colorado, supra; cf. Arizona v. California, 373 U. S. 546, 562. The applicable federal
            common law depends on the facts peculiar to the particular case.</p> "Priority of
         appropriation is the guiding principle. But physical and climatic conditions, the
         consumptive use of water in the several sections of the river, the character and rate of
         return flows, the extent of established uses, the availability of storage water, the
         practical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas, the damage to upstream areas as
         compared to the benefits to downstream areas if a limitation is imposed on the
         former&#x97;these are all relevant factors. They are merely an illustrative, not an
         exhaustive catalogue. They indicate the nature of the problem of apportionment and the
         delicate adjustment of interests which must be made." 325 U. S., at 618. <p>When it comes
            to water pollution this Court has spoken in terms of "a public nuisance,"<span
               class="sup">[8]</span>New York v. New Jersey, <span class="star-pagination"
               >*107</span> 256 U. S., at 313; New Jersey v. New York City, 283 U. S. 473, 481, 482.
            In Missouri v. Illinois 200 U. S. 496, 520-521, the Court said, "It may be imagined that
            a nuisance might be created by a State upon a navigable river like the Danube, which
            would amount to a casus belli for a State lower down, unless removed. If such a nuisance
            were created by a State upon the Mississippi the controversy would be resolved by the
            more peaceful means of a suit in this court."</p>
         <p>It may happen that new federal laws and new federal regulations may in time pre-empt the
            field of federal common law of nuisance. But until that comes to pass, federal courts
            will be empowered to appraise the equities of the suits alleging creation of a public
            nuisance by water pollution. While federal law governs,<span class="sup">[9]</span>
            consideration of state standards may be relevant. Cf. Connecticut v. Massachusetts, 282
            U. S. 660, 670; Kansas v. Colorado, 185 U. S. 125, 146-147. Thus, a State with high
            water-quality standards may well ask that its strict standards be honored and that it
            not be compelled to lower itself to the more degrading standards of a neighbor. There
            are no fixed rules that govern; these <span class="star-pagination">*108</span> will be
            equity suits in which the informed judgment of the chancellor will largely govern.</p>
         <p>We deny, without prejudice, the motion for leave to file. While this original suit
            normally might be the appropriate vehicle for resolving this controversy, we exercise
            our discretion to remit the parties to an appropriate district court<span class="sup"
               >[10]</span> whose powers are adequate to resolve the issues.</p>
         <p>So ordered.</p>

         <p>[1] It is equally well settled that a suit between a State and a citizen of another

         <p>"The question then is, what is the substantive law to be applied in suits under ยง 301

            law, which the courts must fashion from the policy of our national labor laws. The labor
            Management Relations Act expressly furnishes some substantive law. It points out what
            the parties may or may not do in certain situations. Other problems will lie in the
            penumbra of express statutory mandates. Some will lack express statutory sanction but
            will be solved by looking at the policy of the legislation and fashioning a remedy that
            will effectuate that policy. The range of judicial inventiveness will be determined by
            the nature of the problem. Federal interpretation of the federal law will govern, not
            state law. But state law, if compatible with the purpose of ยง 301, may be resorted to in
            order to find the rule that will best effectuate the federal policy. Any state law

         <p>[6] Thus, it is not only the character of the parties that requires us to apply federal
            law. See Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., 206 U. S. 230, 237; cf. Wisconsin v. Pelican
            Ins. Co., 127 U. S. 265, 289; The Federalist No. 80 (A. Hamilton). As Mr. Justice Harlan
            indicated for the Court in Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U. S. 398, 421-427,
            where there is an overriding federal interest in the need for a uniform rule of decision
            or where the controversy touches basic interests of federalism, we have fashioned
            federal common law. See also Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, 318 U. S. 363;
            D'Oench, Duhme &amp;amp; Co. v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., 315 U. S. 447; C. Wright,
            The Law of Federal Courts 249 (2d ed. 1970); Woods &amp;amp; Reed, supra, n. 5, at
            703-713; Note, 50 Texas L. Rev. 183. Certainly these same demands for applying federal
            law are present in the pollution of a body of water such as Lake Michigan bounded, as it
            is, by four States.</p>
         <p>[7] Those who maintain that state law governs overlook the fact that the Hinderlider
            case was written by Mr. Justice Brandeis who also wrote for the Court in Erie R. Co. v.
            Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, the two cases being decided the same day.</p>
         <p>[8] In North Dakota v. Minnesota, 263 U. S. 365, 374, the Court said: </p>
         <p>"[W]here one State, by a change in its method of draining water from lands within its
            border, increases the flow into an interstate stream, so that its natural capacity is
            greatly exceeded and the water is thrown upon the farms of another State, the latter
            State has such an interest as quasi-sovereign in the comfort, health and prosperity of
            its farm owners that resort may be had to this Court for relief. It is the creation of a
            public nuisance of simple type for which a State may properly ask an injunction."</p>
         <p>[9] "Federal common law and not the varying common law of the individual States is, we
            think, entitled and necessary to be recognized as a basis for dealing in uniform
            standard with the environmental rights of a State against improper impairment by sources
            outside its domain. The more would this seem to be imperative in the present era of
            growing concern on the part of a State about its ecological conditions and impairments
            of them. In the outside sources of such impairment, more conflicting disputes,
            increasing assertions and proliferating contentions would seem to be inevitable. Until
            the field has been made the subject of comprehensive legislation or authorized
            administrative standards, only a federal common law basis can provide an adequate means
            for dealing with such claims as alleged federal rights. And the logic and practicality
            of regarding such claims as being entitled to be asserted within the federal-question
            jurisdiction of ยง 1331 (a) would seem to be self-evident." Texas v. Pankey, 441 F. 2d
            236, 241-242.</p>
         <p>[10] The rule of decision being federal, the "action . . . may be brought only in the
            judicial district where all defendants reside, or in which the claim arose," 28 U. S. C.
            ยง 1391 (b), thereby giving flexibility to the choice of venue. See also 28 U. S. C. ยง
            1407. </p>
         <p>Whatever may be a municipality's sovereign immunity in actions for damages, see Van
            Alstyne, Governmental Tort Liability: A Decade of Change, 1966 U. Ill. L. F. 919,
            944-948; Note, 4 Suffolk L. Rev. 832 (1970), actions seeking injunctive relief stand on
            a different footing. The cases are virtually unanimous in holding that municipalities
            are subject to injunctions to abate nuisances. See cases collected in 17 E. McQuillin,
            The Law of Municipal Corporations ยง 49.51 et seq. (3d rev. ed. 1968). See also Wis.
            Stat. Ann. ยง 59.96 (6) (b) (1957) as respects the suability of metropolitan sewerage
            commissions.</p>
         <p>While the kind of equitable relief to be accorded lies in the discretion of the
            chancellor (Harrisonville v. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co., 289 U. S. 334), a State that causes a
            public nuisance is suable in this Court and any of its public entities is suable in a
            federal district court having jurisdiction:</p>
         <p>"[I]t is generally held that a municipality, like a private individual, may be enjoined
            from maintaining a nuisance. Thus in a proper case a municipal corporation will be
            restrained by injunction from creating a nuisance on private property, as by the
            discharge of sewage or poisonous gases thereon, or, in some jurisdictions, by the
            obstruction of drainage of waters, or by discharging sewage or filth into a stream and
            polluting the water to the damage of lower riparian owners, or by dumping garbage or
            refuse, or by other acts. Likewise, a municipality may be enjoined from creating or
            operating a nuisance, whether the municipality is acting in a governmental or
            proprietary capacity, impairing property rights. And, if a nuisance is established
            causing irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law it may be
            enjoined irrespective of the resulting damage or injury to the municipality." 17
            McQuillin, supra, ยง 49.55.</p>
