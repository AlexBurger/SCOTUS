         <p>Justice Stevens, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
         <p>Petitioner, a long-time prison inmate, seeks damages from a corrections officer based on
            a constitutional claim that requires proof of improper motive. The broad question
            presented is whether the courts of appeals may craft special procedural rules for such
            cases to protect public servants from the burdens of trial and discovery that may impair
            the performance of their official duties. The more specific question is whether, at
            least in cases brought by prisoners, the <span class="star-pagination">*578</span>
            plaintiff must adduce clear and convincing evidence of improper motive in order to
            defeat a motion for summary judgment.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>Petitioner is serving a life sentence in the District of Columbia's correctional system.
            During his confinement he has filed several lawsuits and has assisted other prisoners
            with their cases. He has also provided interviews to reporters who have written news
            stories about prison conditions. He is a litigious and outspoken prisoner.</p>
         <p>The events that gave rise to this case occurred in 1988 and 1989. Because of
            overcrowding in the District of Columbia prison in Lorton, Virginia, petitioner and
            other inmates were transferred to the county jail in Spokane, Washington. Thereafter, he
            was moved, first to a Washington State prison, later to a facility in Cameron, Missouri,
            next back to Lorton, then to Petersburg, Virginia, and ultimately to the federal prison
            in Marianna, Florida. Three boxes containing his personal belongings, including legal
            materials, were transferred separately. When the District of Columbia Department of
            Corrections received the boxes from the Washington State facility, respondent, a
            District correctional officer, asked petitioner's brother-in-law to pick them up rather
            than sending them directly to petitioner's next destination. The boxes were ultimately
            shipped to Marianna by petitioner's mother, at petitioner's expense, but he was
            initially denied permission to receive them because they had been sent outside official
            prison channels. He finally recovered the property several months after his arrival in
            Florida.</p>
         <p>Petitioner contends that respondent deliberately misdirected the boxes to punish him for
            exercising his First Amendment rights and to deter similar conduct in the future. Beyond
            generalized allegations of respondent's hostility, he alleges specific incidents in
            which his protected speech had <span class="star-pagination">*579</span> provoked
               her.<span class="sup">[1]</span> His claimed injury caused by the delay in receiving
            his boxes includes the costs of having the boxes shipped and purchasing new clothes and
            other items in the interim, as well as mental and emotional distress. Respondent denies
            any retaliatory motive and asserts that she entrusted the property to petitioner's
            brother-in-law, who was also a District of Columbia corrections employee, in order to
            ensure its prompt and safe delivery.</p>
         <p>Although the factual dispute is relatively simple, it engendered litigation that has
            been both protracted and complex. We shall briefly describe the proceedings that led to
            the en banc Court of Appeals decision that we are reviewing, and then summarize that
            decision. The Early Proceedings</p>
         <p>Petitioner filed suit against respondent and the District of Columbia seeking damages
            under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U. S. C. § 1983.<span class="sup">[2]</span> The principal
            theory advanced in his original <span class="star-pagination">*580</span> complaint was
            that respondent had diverted the boxes containing his legal materials in order to
            interfere with his constitutional right of access to the courts.</p>
         <p>Prior to discovery, respondent, relying in part on a qualified immunity defense, moved
            for dismissal of the complaint or summary judgment. The motion was denied and respondent
            appealed, arguing, first, that the complaint did not allege a violation of any
            constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of her acts; and, second,
            that the complaint "failed to satisfy the `heightened pleading standard' that this
            circuit applies to damage actions against government officials." 951 F. 2d 1314, 1316
            (CADC 1991).</p>
         <p>The Court of Appeals agreed with petitioner that his constitutional right of access to
            the courts was well established in 1989, and that his allegations of wrongful intent
            were sufficiently detailed and specific to withstand a motion to dismiss even under the
            Circuit's "heightened pleading standard." Id., at 1318, 1321. The court concluded,
            however, that the allegations of actual injury to his ability to litigate were
            insufficient under that standard; accordingly, the complaint should have been dismissed.
            Id., at 1321-1322. Because the contours of the pleading standard had been clarified in a
            decision announced while the case was on appeal, see Hunter v. District of Columbia, 943
            F. 2d 69 (CADC 1991), the court concluded that petitioner should be allowed to
            replead.</p>
         <p>On remand, petitioner filed an amended complaint adding more detail to support his
            access claim and also adding two new claims: a due process claim and the claim that
            respondent's alleged diversion of his property was motivated by an <span
               class="star-pagination">*581</span> intent to retaliate against him for exercising
            his First Amendment rights. The District Court dismissed the amended complaint because
            the court access claim and the due process claim were legally insufficient, and because

            Court of Appeals holding that allegations of circumstantial evidence of such a
            motivation were insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. See Martin v. D. C.
            Metropolitan Police Department, 812 F. 2d 1425, 1435 (1987); Siegert v. Gilley, 895 F.

            Proceeding</p>
         <p>A panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the first two claims but
            suggested that the entire court should review the dismissal of the First Amendment
            retaliation claim. Accordingly, the en banc court ordered the parties to file briefs
            addressing five specific questions, two of which concerned the power of the Circuit to
            supplement the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure with special pleading requirements for
            plaintiffs bringing civil rights claims against government officials,<span class="sup"
               >[3]</span> and two of which concerned possible special grounds for granting defense
            motions for summary judgment in cases "where the unlawfulness depends on the <span
               class="star-pagination">*582</span> actor's unconstitutional motive."<span
               class="sup">[4]</span> The fifth was a catchall question that asked the parties
            whether there are "any alternative devices which protect defendants with qualified
            immunity, in cases of constitutional tort depending on the defendant's motive or intent,
            from the costs of litigation?" App. to Pet. for Cert. 109a.</p>
         <p>The en banc court responded to these questions in five separate opinions. A majority of
            the judges appear to have agreed on these four propositions: (1) the case should be
            remanded to the District Court for further proceedings; (2) the plaintiff does not have
            to satisfy any heightened pleading requirement, and may rely on circumstantial as well
            as direct evidence;<span class="sup">[5]</span> (3) in order to prevail in an
            unconstitutionalmotive case, the plaintiff must establish that motive by clear and
            convincing evidence; and (4) special procedures to protect defendants from the costs of
            litigation in <span class="star-pagination">*583</span> unconstitutional-motive cases
            are required by the reasoning in this Court's opinion in Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S.
            800 (1982).</p>
         <p>The primary opinion, written by Judge Williams, announced two principal conclusions:
            "First, we think Harlow allows an official to get summary judgment resolution of the
            qualified immunity issue, including the question of the official's state of mind, before
            the plaintiff has engaged in discovery on that issue. Second, we believe that unless the
            plaintiff offers clear and convincing evidence on the state-of-mind issue at summary
            judgment and trial, judgment or directed verdict (as appropriate) should be granted for
            the individual defendant." 93 F. 3d 813, 815 (CADC 1996).</p>
         <p>Judge Silberman criticized Judge Williams' approach as confusing, id., at 833, and
            suggested that Harlow' s reasoning pointed to a "more straightforward solution," 93 F.
            3d, at 834. In his opinion, whenever a defendant asserts a legitimate motive for his or
            her action, only an objective inquiry into pretextuality should be allowed. "If the
            facts establish that the purported motivation would have been reasonable, the defendant
            is entitled to qualified immunity." Ibid.</p>
         <p>Judge Ginsburg agreed with the decision to impose a clear and convincing standard of
            proof on the unconstitutional motive issue, but he could not accept Judge Williams' new
            requirement that the District Court must "grant summary judgment prior to discovery
            unless the plaintiff already has in hand" sufficient evidence to satisfy that standard.
            Id., at 839. He described that innovation as "a rather bold intrusion into the district
            court's management of the fact-finding process" that would result in the defeat of
            meritorious claims and "invite an increase in the number of constitutional torts that
            are committed." Ibid. He would allow limited discovery on a proper showing before ruling
            on a summary judgment motion, but noted that in cases involving qualified immunity it
            would be an abuse of discretion for the trial judge to fail to consider, not only the
            interests of the parties, "but <span class="star-pagination">*584</span> also the social
            costs associated with discovery had against a government official." Id., at 840. With
            reference to the case at hand, he expressed the view that if petitioner could not show
            that discovery might reveal more than already appeared in the record, summary judgment
            would be appropriate without any discovery. Id., at 841-844.</p>
         <p>Judge Henderson "fully" endorsed the plurality's new clear and convincing evidence
            standard, but thought that it was a mistake for her colleagues to hear this case en banc
            because the record already made it abundantly clear that petitioner's claim had no
            merit. Id., at 844-845.</p>
         <p>Chief Judge Edwards, joined by four other judges, criticized the majority for "`crossing
            the line between adjudication and legislation.' " Id., at 847 (quoting Frankfurter, Some
            Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 535 (1947)). He expressed
            the view that the new evidentiary standards were unauthorized by statute or precedent
            and "would make it all but certain that an entire category of constitutional tort claims
            against government officials&#x97;whether or not meritorious&#x97;would never be able to
            survive a defendant's assertion of qualified immunity." 93 F. 3d, at 847.</p>
         <p>The different views expressed in those five opinions attest to the importance of both
            the underlying issue and a correct understanding of the relationship between our holding
            in Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800 (1982), and the plaintiff's burden when his or
            her entitlement to relief depends on proof of an improper motive. Despite the relative
            unimportance of the facts of this particular case, we therefore decided to grant
            certiorari. 520 U. S. 1273 (1997).</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>The Court of Appeals' requirement of clear and convincing evidence of improper motive is
            that court's latest effort to address a potentially serious problem: Because an
            official's <span class="star-pagination">*585</span> state of mind is "easy to allege
            and hard to disprove," insubstantial claims that turn on improper intent may be less
            amenable to summary disposition than other types of claims against government officials.
            93 F. 3d, at 816, 821. This category of claims therefore implicates obvious concerns
            with the social costs of subjecting public officials to discovery and trial, as well as
            liability for damages. The other Courts of Appeals have also grappled with this problem,
            but none has adopted a heightened burden of proof. See id., at 851&#x97; 852, n. 7
            (Edwards, C. J., concurring in judgment) (citing cases).</p>
         <p>The new rule established in this case is not limited to suits by prisoners against local
            officials, but applies to all classes of plaintiffs bringing damages actions against any
            government official, whether federal, state, or local. See Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S.
            478, 500-504 (1978). The heightened burden of proof applies, moreover, to the wide array
            of different federal law claims for which an official's motive is a necessary element,
            such as claims of race and gender discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection
               Clause,<span class="sup">[6]</span> cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the
            Eighth Amendment,<span class="sup">[7]</span> and termination of employment based on
            political affiliation in violation of the First Amendment,<span class="sup">[8]</span>
            as well as retaliation for the exercise of free speech or other constitutional
               rights.<span class="sup">[9]</span> A bare majority of the Court of Appeals regarded
            this sweeping rule as a necessary corollary to our opinion in Harlow.</p>
         <p>There is, of course, an important difference between the holding in a case and the
            reasoning that supports that holding. We shall, therefore, begin by explaining why our
            holding <span class="star-pagination">*586</span> in Harlow does not resolve the issue
            presented in this case&#x97;indeed, it does not even address any question concerning the
            plaintiff's affirmative case. We shall then consider whether the reasoning in that
            opinion nevertheless supports the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals. Harlow's
            Specific Holding</p>
         <p>In 1968, A. Ernest Fitzgerald testified before a congressional subcommittee about
            technical difficulties and excessive costs incurred in the development of a new
            transport plane. His testimony was widely reported and evidently embarrassed his
            superiors in the Department of Defense. In 1970, his job as a management analyst with
            the Department of the Air Force was eliminated in a "departmental reorganization and
            reduction in force." Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 733 (1982). After the
            conclusion of extended proceedings before the Civil Service Commission in 1973,
            Fitzgerald filed suit against the President of the United States and some of his aides
            alleging that they had eliminated his job in retaliation for his testimony. He sought
            damages on both statutory grounds and "in a direct action under the Constitution." Id.,
            at 748. When his charges were reviewed in this Court, we considered the defendants'
            claims to immunity in two separate opinions. In Nixon v. Fitzgerald, we held that a
            former President is entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability predicated on
            conduct within the scope of his official duties. Id., at 749. In Harlow v. Fitzgerald,
            457 U. S. 800 (1982), we held that the senior aides and advisers of the President were
            not entitled to absolute immunity, id., at 808-813, but instead were protected by a
            "qualified immunity standard that would permit the defeat of insubstantial claims
            without resort to trial." Id., at 813.</p>
         <p>Our definition of that qualified immunity standard was informed by three propositions
            that had been established by earlier cases. First, in Gomez v. Toledo, 446 U. S. 635,
            639&#x97; <span class="star-pagination">*587</span> 641 (1980), we held that qualified
            immunity is an affirmative defense and that "the burden of pleading it rests with the
            defendant." Second, in Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S., at 503&#x97; 504, we determined that
            the scope of that defense was the same in actions against state officials under 42 U. S.
            C. § 1983 and in actions against federal officials under the Federal Constitution, and
            that in both types of actions the courts are "competent to determine the appropriate
            level of immunity." Third, in Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232 (1974), we presumed that
            the defense protects all officers in the executive branch of government performing
            discretionary functions, id., at 245-248, but held that the presumption was rebuttable,
            id., at 249-250.</p>
         <p>The actual scope of the defense had been the subject of debate within the Court in Wood
            v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308 (1975), a case involving a constitutional claim against the
            members of a school board. A bare majority in that case concluded that the plaintiff
            could overcome the defense of qualified immunity in two different ways, either if (1)
            the defendant "knew or reasonably should have known that the action he took within his
            sphere of official responsibility would violate the constitutional rights of the student
            affected," or (2) "he took the action with the malicious intention to cause a
            deprivation of constitutional rights or other injury to the student." Id., at 322. In
            dissent, Justice Powell argued that the majority's standard was too demanding of public
            officials, but his proposed standard, like the majority's, included both an objective
            and a subjective component. In his view, our opinion in Scheuer had established this
            standard: "whether in light of the discretion and responsibilities of his office, and
            under all of the circumstances as they appeared at the time, the officer acted
            reasonably and in good faith. " 420 U. S., at 330 (emphasis added).</p>
         <p>In Harlow, the Court reached a consensus on the proper formulation of the standard for
            judging the defense of qualified <span class="star-pagination">*588</span> immunity.
            Speaking for the Court, Justice Powell announced a single objective standard:</p>
         "Consistently with the balance at which we aimed in Butz, we conclude today that bare
         allegations of malice should not suffice to subject government officials either to the
         costs of trial or to the burdens of broad-reaching discovery. We therefore hold that
         government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from
         liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established
         statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known." 457 U.
         S., at 817-818. <p>Under that standard, a defense of qualified immunity may not be rebutted
            by evidence that the defendant's conduct was malicious or otherwise improperly
            motivated. Evidence concerning the defendant's subjective intent is simply irrelevant to
            that defense.</p>
         <p>Our holding that "bare allegations of malice" cannot overcome the qualified immunity
            defense did not implicate the elements of the plaintiff's initial burden of proving a
            constitutional violation. It is obvious, of course, that bare allegations of malice
            would not suffice to establish a constitutional claim. It is equally clear that an
            essential element of some constitutional claims is a charge that the defendant's conduct
            was improperly motivated. For example, A. Ernest Fitzgerald's constitutional claims
            against President Nixon and his aides were based on the theory that they had retaliated
            against him for speaking out on a matter of public concern.<span class="sup">[10]</span>
            Our consideration of the immunity issues in both the Nixon <span class="star-pagination"
               >*589</span> case and in Harlow itself assumed that Fitzgerald would be entitled to
            prevail but for the immunity defenses.<span class="sup">[11]</span> Thus, although
            evidence of improper motive is irrelevant on the issue of qualified immunity, it may be
            an essential component of the plaintiff's affirmative case. Our holding in Harlow, which
            related only to the scope of an affirmative defense, provides no support for making any
            change in the nature of the plaintiff's burden of proving a constitutional
            violation.</p>
         <p>Nevertheless, the en banc court's ruling makes just such a change in the plaintiff's
            cause of action. The court's clear and convincing evidence requirement applies to the
            plaintiff's showing of improper intent (a pure issue of fact), not to the separate
            qualified immunity question whether the official's alleged conduct violated clearly
            established law, which is an "essentially legal question." Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.
            S. 511, 526-529 (1985); see Gomez, 446 U. S., at 640 ("[T]his Court has never indicated
            that qualified immunity is relevant to the existence of the plaintiff's cause of
            action"). Indeed, the court's heightened proof standard logically should govern even if
            the official never asserts an immunity defense. See 93 F. 3d, at 815, 838. Such a rule
            is not required by the holding in Harlow. <span class="star-pagination">*590</span> The
            Reasoning in Harlow</p>
         <p>Two reasons that are explicit in our opinion in Harlow, together with a third that is
            implicit in the holding, amply justified Harlow' s reformulation of the qualified
            immunity defense. First, there is a strong public interest in protecting public
            officials from the costs associated with the defense of damages actions.<span
               class="sup">[12]</span> That interest is best served by a defense that permits
            insubstantial lawsuits to be quickly terminated. Second, allegations of subjective
            motivation might have been used to shield baseless lawsuits from summary judgment. 457
            U. S., at 817-818. The objective standard, in contrast, raises questions concerning the
            state of the law at the time of the challenged conduct&#x97;questions that normally can
            be resolved on summary judgment. Third, focusing on "the objective legal reasonableness
            of an official's acts," id., at 819, avoids the unfairness of imposing liability on a
            defendant who "could not reasonably be expected to anticipate subsequent legal
            developments, nor . . . fairly be said to `know' that the law forbade conduct not
            previously identified as unlawful," id., at 818.<span class="sup">[13]</span> That
            unfairness may <span class="star-pagination">*591</span> be present even when the
            official conduct is motivated, in part, by hostility to the plaintiff.</p>
         <p>This last rationale of fairness does not provide any justification for the imposition of
            special burdens on plaintiffs who allege misconduct that was plainly unlawful when it
            occurred. While there is obvious unfairness in imposing liability&#x97;indeed, even in
            compelling the defendant to bear the burdens of discovery and trial&#x97;for engaging in
            conduct that was objectively reasonable when it occurred, no such unfairness can be
            attributed to holding one accountable for actions that he or she knew, or should have
            known, violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiff. Harlow itself said as much:
            "If the law was clearly established, the immunity defense ordinarily should fail, since
            a reasonably competent public official should know the law governing his conduct." Id.,
            at 818-819; see also Butz, 438 U. S., at 506 ("[I]t is not unfair to hold liable the
            official who knows or should know he is acting outside the law . . .").</p>
         <p>The first two reasons underlying our holding in Harlow, however, would provide support
            for a procedural rule that makes it harder for any plaintiff, especially one whose
            constitutional claim requires proof of an improper motive, to survive a motion for
            summary judgment. But there are countervailing concerns that must be considered before
            concluding that the balance struck in the context of defining an affirmative defense is
            also appropriate when evaluating the elements of the plaintiff's cause of action. In
            Harlow, we expressly noted the need for such a balance "between the evils inevitable in
            any available alternative." 457 U. S., at 813-814. We further emphasized: "In situations
            of abuse of office, an action for damages may offer the only realistic avenue for
            vindication of constitutional guarantees." Id., at 814. Social costs that adequately
            justified the elimination of the subjective component of an affirmative defense do not
            necessarily justify serious limitations upon "the only realistic" remedy for the
            violation of constitutional guarantees.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*592</span> There are several reasons why we believe that
            here, unlike Harlow, the proper balance does not justify a judicial revision of the law
            to bar claims that depend on proof of an official's motive. Initially, there is an
            important distinction between the "bare allegations of malice" that would have provided
            the basis for rebutting a qualified immunity defense under Wood v. Strickland and the
            allegations of intent that are essential elements of certain constitutional claims.
            Under Wood, the mere allegation of intent to cause any "other injury," not just a
            deprivation of constitutional rights, would have permitted an open-ended inquiry into
            subjective motivation. 420 U. S., at 322. When intent is an element of a constitutional
            violation, however, the primary focus is not on any possible animus directed at the
            plaintiff; rather, it is more specific, such as an intent to disadvantage all members of
            a class that includes the plaintiff, see, e. g., Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229,
            239-248 (1976), or to deter public comment on a specific issue of public importance.
            Thus, in Harlow, hostility to the content of Fitzgerald's testimony, rather than an
            intent to cause him harm, was the relevant component of the constitutional claim. In
            this case, proof that respondent diverted the plaintiff's boxes because she hated him
            would not necessarily demonstrate that she was responding to his public comments about
            prison conditions, although under Wood such evidence might have rebutted the qualified
            immunity defense.</p>
         <p>Moreover, existing law already prevents this more narrow element of unconstitutional
            motive from automatically carrying a plaintiff to trial. The immunity standard in Harlow
            itself eliminates all motive-based claims in which the official's conduct did not
            violate clearly established law. Even when the general rule has long been clearly
            established (for instance, the First Amendment bars retaliation for protected speech),
            the substantive legal doctrine on which the plaintiff relies may facilitate summary
            judgment in two different <span class="star-pagination">*593</span> ways. First, there
            may be doubt as to the illegality of the defendant's particular conduct (for instance,
            whether a plaintiff's speech was on a matter of public concern). See generally Anderson
            v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640-641 (1987). Second, at least with certain types of
            claims, proof of an improper motive is not sufficient to establish a constitutional
            violation&#x97;there must also be evidence of causation. Accordingly, when a public
            employee shows that protected speech was a "motivating factor" in an adverse employment
            decision, the employer still prevails by showing that it would have reached the same
            decision in the absence of the protected conduct. Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,
            429 U. S. 274, 287 (1977). Furthermore, various procedural mechanisms already enable
            trial judges to weed out baseless claims that feature a subjective element, as we
            explain in more detail in Part IV, infra.<span class="sup">[14]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Thus, unlike the subjective component of the immunity defense eliminated by Harlow, the
            improper intent element of various causes of action should not ordinarily preclude
            summary disposition of insubstantial claims. The reasoning in Harlow, like its specific
            holding, does not justify a rule that places a thumb on the defendant's side of the
            scales when the merits of a claim that the defendant knowingly violated the law are
            being resolved. And, a fortiori, the policy concerns <span class="star-pagination"
               >*594</span> underlying Harlow do not support Justice Scalia's unprecedented proposal
            to immunize all officials whose conduct is "objectively valid," regardless of improper
            intent, see post, at 612 (dissenting opinion).</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>In fashioning a special rule for constitutional claims that require proof of improper
            intent, the judges of the Court of Appeals relied almost entirely on our opinion in
            Harlow, and on the specific policy concerns that we identified in that opinion. As we
            have explained, neither that case nor those concerns warrant the wholesale change in the
            law that they have espoused. Without such precedential grounding, for the courts of
            appeals or this Court to change the burden of proof for an entire category of claims
            would stray far from the traditional limits on judicial authority.</p>
         <p>Neither the text of § 1983 or any other federal statute, nor the Federal Rules of Civil
            Procedure, provide any support for imposing the clear and convincing burden of proof on
            plaintiffs either at the summary judgment stage or in the trial itself. The same might
            be said of the qualified immunity defense; but in Harlow, as in the series of earlier
            cases concerning both the absolute and the qualified immunity defenses, we were engaged
            in a process of adjudication that we had consistently and repeatedly viewed as
            appropriate for judicial decision&#x97;a process "predicated upon a considered inquiry
            into the immunity historically accorded the relevant official at common law and the
            interests behind it." Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 421 (1976); see also Butz, 438
            U. S., at 503-504; Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158, 170-172 (1992) (Kennedy, J.,
               concurring).<span class="sup">[15]</span> The unprecedented change <span
               class="star-pagination">*595</span> made by the Court of Appeals in this case,
            however, lacks any common-law pedigree and alters the cause of action itself in a way
            that undermines the very purpose of § 1983&#x97;to provide a remedy for the violation of
            federal rights.<span class="sup">[16]</span>
         </p>
         <p>In the past, we have consistently declined similar invitations to revise established
            rules that are separate from the qualified immunity defense. We refused to change the
            Federal Rules governing pleading by requiring the plaintiff to anticipate the immunity
            defense, Gomez, 446 U. S., at 639&#x97; 640, or requiring pleadings of heightened
            specificity in cases alleging municipal liability, Leatherman v. Tarrant County
            Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S. 163, 164-169 (1993). We also
            declined to craft an exception to settled rules of interlocutory appellate jurisdiction
            and rejected the argument that the policies behind the immunity defense justify
            interlocutory appeals on questions of evidentiary sufficiency. Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.
            S. 304, 317-318 (1995). Our reasons for those unanimous rulings apply with equal force
            to the imposition of a clear and convincing burden of proof in cases alleging
            unconstitutional motive.</p>
         <p>As we have noted, the Court of Appeals adopted a heightened proof standard in large part
            to reduce the availability of discovery in actions that require proof of motive. To the
            extent that the court was concerned with this procedural issue, our cases demonstrate
            that questions regarding pleading, discovery, and summary judgment are most frequently
            and most effectively resolved either by the rulemaking process or the legislative
            process. See, e. g., Leatherman, 507 U. S., at 168-169. Moreover, the Court of Appeals'
            indirect effort to regulate discovery employs a blunt instrument that carries a high
            cost, for its rule also imposes a heightened standard of proof at trial upon plaintiffs
            with bona fide constitutional <span class="star-pagination">*596</span> claims. See
            Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 252-255 (1986).</p>
         <p>One particular recent action by Congress highlights our concern with judicial rulemaking
            to protect officials from damages actions. Both Judge Silberman's opinion below and a
            brief filed in this Court by 34 States, Guam, and the Virgin Islands suggest that new
            substantive or procedural rules are warranted because of the very large number of civil
            rights actions filed by prison inmates. See 93 F. 3d, at 830, 838; Brief for State of
            Missouri et al. as Amici Curiae 12. Arguably, such cases deserve special attention
            because many of them are plainly frivolous and some may be motivated more by a desire to
            obtain a "holiday in court,"<span class="sup">[17]</span> than by a realistic
            expectation of tangible relief.</p>
         <p>Even assuming that a perceived problem with suits by inmates could justify the creation
            of new rules by federal judges, Congress has already fashioned special rules to cover
            these cases. The Prison Litigation Reform Act, Pub. L. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321, enacted
            in April 1996, contains provisions that should discourage prisoners from filing claims
            that are unlikely to succeed. Among the many new changes relating to civil suits, the
            statute requires all inmates to pay filing fees; denies in forma pauperis status to
            prisoners with three or more prior "strikes" (dismissals because a filing is frivolous,
            malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted) unless the
            prisoner is "under imminent danger of serious physical injury," § 804(d); bars suits for
            mental or emotional injury unless there is a prior showing of physical injury; limits
            attorney's fees; directs district courts to screen prisoners' complaints before
            docketing and authorizes the court on its own motion to dismiss "frivolous,"
            "malicious," or meritless actions; permits the revocation of good <span
               class="star-pagination">*597</span> time credits for federal prisoners who file
            malicious or false claims; and encourages hearings by telecommunication or in prison
            facilities to make it unnecessary for inmate plaintiffs to leave prison for pretrial
            proceedings. See 28 U. S. C. §§ 1346(b)(2), 1915, 1915A, 1932 (1994 ed., Supp. II); 42
            U. S. C. § 1997e (1994 ed., Supp. II). Recent statistics suggest that the Act is already
            having its intended effect.<span class="sup">[18]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Most significantly, the statute draws no distinction between constitutional claims that
            require proof of an improper motive and those that do not. If there is a compelling need
            to frame new rules of law based on such a distinction, presumably Congress either would
            have dealt with the problem in the Reform Act, or will respond to it in future
            legislation.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>IV</h2>
         <p>In Harlow, we noted that a "`firm application of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure'
            is fully warranted" and may lead to the prompt disposition of insubstantial claims. 457
            U. S., at 819-820, n. 35 (quoting Butz, 438 U. S., at 508). Though we have rejected the
            Court of Appeals' solution, we are aware of the potential problem that troubled the
            court. It is therefore appropriate to add a few words on some of the existing procedures
            available to federal trial judges in handling claims that involve examination of an
            official's state of mind.</p>
         <p>When a plaintiff files a complaint against a public official alleging a claim that
            requires proof of wrongful motive, the trial court must exercise its discretion in a way
            that protects the substance of the qualified immunity defense. It must <span
               class="star-pagination">*598</span> exercise its discretion so that officials are not
            subjected to unnecessary and burdensome discovery or trial proceedings. The district
            judge has two primary options prior to permitting any discovery at all. First, the court
            may order a reply to the defendant's or a third party's answer under Federal Rule of
            Civil Procedure 7(a), or grant the defendant's motion for a more definite statement
            under Rule 12(e). Thus, the court may insist that the plaintiff "put forward specific,
            nonconclusory factual allegations" that establish improper motive causing cognizable
            injury in order to survive a prediscovery motion for dismissal or summary judgment.
            Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U. S. 226, 236 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). This
            option exists even if the official chooses not to plead the affirmative defense of
            qualified immunity. Second, if the defendant does plead the immunity defense, the
            district court should resolve that threshold question before permitting discovery.
            Harlow, 457 U. S., at 818. To do so, the court must determine whether, assuming the
            truth of the plaintiff's allegations, the official's conduct violated clearly
            established law.<span class="sup">[19]</span> Because the former option of demanding
            more specific allegations of intent places no burden on the defendant-official, the
            district judge may choose that alternative before resolving the immunity question, which
            sometimes requires complicated analysis of legal issues.</p>
         <p>If the plaintiff's action survives these initial hurdles and is otherwise viable, the
            plaintiff ordinarily will be entitled to some discovery. Rule 26 vests the trial judge
            with broad discretion to tailor discovery narrowly and to dictate the sequence of
            discovery. On its own motion, the trial court</p> "may alter the limits in [the Federal
         Rules] on the number of depositions and interrogatories and may also limit the length of
         depositions under Rule 30 and the number <span class="star-pagination">*599</span> of
         requests under Rule 36. The frequency or extent of use of the discovery methods otherwise
         permitted under these rules . . . shall be limited by the court if it determines that . . .
         (iii) the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, taking
         into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the parties' resources, the
         importance of the issues at stake in the litigation, and the importance of the proposed
         discovery in resolving the issues." Rule 26(b)(2). <p>Additionally, upon motion the court
            may limit the time, place, and manner of discovery, or even bar discovery altogether on
            certain subjects, as required "to protect a party or person from annoyance,
            embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense." Rule 26(c). And the court may
            also set the timing and sequence of discovery. Rule 26(d).</p>
         <p>These provisions create many options for the district judge. For instance, the court may
            at first permit the plaintiff to take only a focused deposition of the defendant before
            allowing any additional discovery. See, e. g., Martin, 812 F. 2d, at 1437 (opinion of R.
            B. Ginsburg, J.). Alternatively, the court may postpone all inquiry regarding the
            official's subjective motive until discovery has been had on objective factual questions
            such as whether the plaintiff suffered any injury or whether the plaintiff actually
            engaged in protected conduct that could be the object of unlawful retaliation. The trial
            judge can therefore manage the discovery process to facilitate prompt and efficient
            resolution of the lawsuit; as the evidence is gathered, the defendant-official may move
            for partial summary judgment on objective issues that are potentially dispositive and
            are more amenable to summary disposition than disputes about the official's intent,
            which frequently turn on credibility assessments.<span class="sup">[20]</span> Of
            course, the <span class="star-pagination">*600</span> judge should give priority to
            discovery concerning issues that bear upon the qualified immunity defense, such as the
            actions that the official actually took, since that defense should be resolved as early
            as possible. See Anderson, 483 U. S., at 646, n. 6.<span class="sup">[21]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Beyond these procedures and others that we have not mentioned, summary judgment serves
            as the ultimate screen to weed out truly insubstantial lawsuits prior to trial. At that
            stage, if the defendant-official has made a properly supported motion,<span class="sup"
               >[22]</span> the plaintiff may not respond simply with general attacks upon the
            defendant's credibility, but rather must identify affirmative evidence from which a jury
            could find that the plaintiff has carried his or her burden of proving the pertinent
            motive. Liberty Lobby, 477 U. S., at 256-257. Finally, federal trial judges are
            undoubtedly familiar with two additional tools that are available in extreme cases to
            protect public officials from undue harassment: Rule 11, which authorizes sanctions for
            the filing of papers that are frivolous, lacking in factual support, or "presented for
            any improper purpose, such as to harass"; and 28 U. S. C. § 1915(e)(2) (1994 ed., Supp.
            II), which authorizes dismissal "at any time" of in forma pauperis suits that are
            "frivolous or malicious."</p>
         <p>It is the district judges rather than appellate judges like ourselves who have had the
            most experience in managing cases in which an official's intent is an element. Given the
               <span class="star-pagination">*601</span> wide variety of civil rights and
            "constitutional tort" claims that trial judges confront, broad discretion in the
            management of the factfinding process may be more useful and equitable to all the
            parties than the categorical rule imposed by the Court of Appeals.</p>
         <p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further
            proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
         <p>It is so ordered.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="concurrence" judge="kennedy">
         <p>Justice Kennedy, concurring.</p>
         <p>Prisoner suits under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 can illustrate our legal order at its best and
            its worst. The best is that even as to prisoners the government must obey always the
            Constitution. The worst is that many of these suits invoke our basic charter in support
            of claims which fall somewhere between the frivolous and the farcical and so foster
            disrespect for our laws.</p>
         <p>We must guard against disdain for the judicial system. As Madison reminds us, if the
            Constitution is to endure, it must from age to age retain "th[e] veneration which time
            bestows." James Madison, The Federalist No. 49, p. 314 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). The
            analysis by The Chief Justice addresses these serious concerns. I am in full agreement
            with the Court, however, that the authority to propose those far-reaching solutions lies
            with the Legislative Branch, not with us.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="dissent" judge="rehnquist"><p>Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,
            dissenting.</p>
         <p>The petition on which we granted certiorari in this case presents two questions. The
            first asks:</p> "In a case against a government official claiming she retaliated against
         the plaintiff for his exercise of First Amendment rights, does the qualified immunity
         doctrine require the plaintiff to prove the official's unconstitutional <span
            class="star-pagination">*602</span> intent by `clear and convincing' evidence?" Pet. for
         Cert. i. <p>The Court's opinion gives this question an extensive treatment, concluding that
            our cases applying the affirmative defense of qualified immunity provide no basis for
            placing "a thumb on the defendant's side of the scales when the merits of a claim that
            the defendant knowingly violated the law are being resolved." Ante, at 593.</p>
         <p>The second question presented asks:</p> "In a First Amendment retaliation case against a
         government official, is the official entitled to qualified immunity if she asserts a
         legitimate justification for her allegedly retaliatory act and that justification would
         have been a reasonable basis for the act, even if evidence&#x97; no matter how
         strong&#x97;shows the official's actual reason for the act was unconstitutional?" Pet. for
         Cert. i. <p>The Court does not explicitly discuss this question at all. Its failure to do
            so is both puzzling and unfortunate. Puzzling, because immunity is a "threshold"
            question that must be addressed prior to consideration of the merits of a plaintiff's
            claim. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982). Unfortunate, because in assuming
            that the answer to the question is "no," the Court establishes a precedent that is in
            considerable tension with, and significantly undermines, Harlow.</p>
         <p>I would address the question directly, and conclude, along the lines suggested by Judge
            Silberman below, that a government official who is a defendant in a motive-based tort
            suit is entitled to immunity from suit so long as he can offer a legitimate reason for
            the action that is being challenged, and the plaintiff is unable to establish, by
            reliance on objective evidence, that the offered reason is actually a pretext. This is
            the only result that is consistent with Harlow and the purposes of the qualified
            immunity doctrine.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*603</span> In Harlow, respondent A. Ernest Fitzgerald
            brought a suit claiming that White House aides Bryce Harlow and Alexander Butterfield,
            acting in concert with President Richard Nixon and others, had conspired to deprive him
            of his job, deny him reemployment, and besmirch his reputation. Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457
            U. S. 731, 738-739, n. 18 (1982). Harlow and Butterfield claimed that they were immune
            from this suit, and we granted certiorari to determine "the immunity available to the
            senior aides and advisers of the President." Harlow, 457 U. S., at 806. We first
            concluded that unlike the President, senior White House aides were not necessarily
            entitled to absolute immunity. We next concluded, however, that petitioners were
            entitled to "application of the qualified immunity standard that would permit the defeat
            of insubstantial claims without resort to trial." Id., at 813.</p>
         <p>In applying that standard in Harlow we did not write on a blank slate. The notion that
            government officials are sometimes immune from suit has been present in our
            jurisprudence since at least Osborn v. Bank of United States, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/rpi/osborn-v-bank-of-united-states/">
                  <span class="volume">9</span>
                  <span class="reporter">Wheat.</span>
                  <span class="page">738</span>
               </a>
            </span>, 865-866 (1824). By the time we took up the question in Harlow, we had come to
            understand qualified immunity as an affirmative defense that had both an "objective" and
            a "subjective" aspect. See, e. g., Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308, 322 (1975).</p>
         <p>In Harlow, however, we noted that application of the subjective element of the test had
            often produced results at odds with the doctrine's purpose. First, some courts had
            considered an official's subjective good faith to be a question of fact "inherently
            requiring resolution by a jury," making it impossible to accomplish the goal that
            "insubstantial claims" not proceed to trial. 457 U. S., at 816. Second, we noted that
            there were "special costs" to inquiries into a government official's subjective good
            faith. Such inquiries were "broad-ranging," intrusive, and personal, and were thought to
            be "peculiarly disruptive of effective government." Id., at 817.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*604</span> Recognizing these problems, we "purged"
            qualified immunity doctrine of its subjective component and remolded it so that it
            turned entirely on "objective legal reasonableness," measured by the state of the law at
            the time of the challenged act. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 517 (1985); Harlow,
            supra, at 819. This new rule eliminated the need for the disruptive inquiry into
            subjective intent, ensured that insubstantial suits would still be subject to dismissal
            prior to trial, and had the additional benefit of allowing officials to predict when and
            under what circumstances they would be required to stand trial for actions undertaken in
            the course of their work. See, e. g., Davis v. Scherer, 468 U. S. 183, 195 (1984) ("The
            qualified immunity doctrine recognizes that officials can act without fear of harassing
            litigation only if they reasonably can anticipate when their conduct may give rise to
            liability for damages and only if unjustified lawsuits are quickly terminated"). Since
            then we have held that qualified immunity was to apply "across the board" without regard
            to the "precise nature of various officials' duties or the precise character of the
            particular rights alleged to have been violated." Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635,
            642&#x97; 643 (1987).</p>
         <p>Applying these principles to the type of motive-based tort suit at issue here, it is
            obvious that some form of qualified immunity is necessary, and that whether it applies
            in a given case must turn entirely on objective factors. It is not enough to say that
            because (1) the law in this area is "clearly established," and (2) this type of claim
            always turns on a defendant official's subjective intent, that (3) qualified immunity is
            therefore never available. Such logic apparently approves the "protracted and complex,"
            ante, at 579, course of litigation in this case, runs afoul of Harlow `s concern that
            insubstantial claims be prevented from going to trial, and ensures that officials will
            be subject to the "peculiarly disruptive" inquiry into their subjective intent that the
            Harlow <span class="star-pagination">*605</span> rule was designed to prevent.<span
               class="sup">[1]</span> Such a rule would also allow plaintiffs to strip defendants of
            Harlow `s protections by a simple act of pleading&#x97;any minimally competent attorney
            (or pro se litigant) can convert any adverse decision into a motive-based tort, and
            thereby subject government officials to some measure of intrusion into their subjective
            worlds.</p>
         <p>Such a result is quite inconsistent with the logic and underlying principles of
               Harlow.<span class="sup">[2]</span> In order to preserve the protections that Harlow
            conferred, it is necessary to construct a qualified immunity test in this context that
            is also based exclusively on objective factors, and prevents plaintiffs from engaging in
            "peculiarly disruptive" subjective investigations until after the immunity inquiry has
            been resolved in their favor. The test I propose accomplishes this goal. Under this
            test, when a plaintiff alleges that an official's action was taken with an
            unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful motive, the defendant will be entitled to
            immunity and immediate dismissal of the suit if he can offer a lawful reason for his
            action and the plaintiff cannot establish, through objective evidence, that the offered
            reason is actually a pretext.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*606</span> The Court's interpretation of Harlow does not
            differ from mine. See ante, at 588 ("Under [the Harlow ] standard, a defense of
            qualified immunity may not be rebutted by evidence that the defendant's conduct was
            malicious or otherwise improperly motivated. Evidence concerning the defendant's
            subjective intent is simply irrelevant to that defense"). The Court does not, however,
            carry the Harlow principles to their logical extension. Its failure to discuss the issue
            explicitly makes it difficult to understand exactly why it rejects my position, but
            there appear to be two possibilities.</p>
         <p>First, the Court appears concerned that an extension of Harlow qualified immunity to
            motive-based torts will mean that some meritorious claims will go unredressed. Ante, at
            591 ("Social costs that adequately justified the elimination of the subjective component
            of an affirmative defense do not necessarily justify serious limitations upon `the only
            realistic' remedy for the violation of constitutional guarantees"). This is perhaps
            true, but it is not a sufficient reason to refuse to apply the doctrine. Every time a
            privilege is created or an immunity extended, it is understood that some meritorious
            claims will be dismissed that otherwise would have been heard. Courts and legislatures
            craft these immunities because it is thought that the societal benefit they confer
            outweighs whatever cost they create in terms of unremedied meritorious claims. In
            crafting our qualified immunity doctrine, we have always considered the public policy
            implications of our decisions. See, e. g., Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158, 167 (1992).</p>
         <p>In considering those implications here, it is desirable to reflect on the subspecies of
            First Amendment claims which we address in this case. Respondent Britton is a District
            of Columbia corrections officer; petitioner Crawford-El is a District of Columbia
            prisoner who was transferred from Spokane, Washington, to Marianna, Florida, with
            intermediate stops along the way. The action of Britton's that gave rise to this lawsuit
            was asking Crawford-El's brother-in-law to <span class="star-pagination">*607</span>
            pick up boxes of the former's belongings for delivery to him, rather than shipping them
            directly to him in Florida. This act, considered by itself, would seem to be about as
            far from a violation of the First Amendment as can be conceived. But Crawford-El has
            alleged that Britton's decision to deliver his belongings to a relative was motivated by
            a desire to punish him for previous interviews with reporters that he had given, and
            lawsuits that he had filed. This claim of illicit motive, Crawford-El asserts,
            transforms a routine act in the course of prison administration into a constitutional
            tort.</p>
         <p>The Court cites Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,
            391 U. S. 563 (1968), as an example of this sort of tort. Ante, at 585, n. 9. But
            Pickering is but a distant cousin to the present case; there the school board plainly
            stated that its reason for discharging the plaintiff teacher was his writing of a letter
            to a newspaper criticizing the board. It was not motivation that was disputed, but
            whether the First Amendment protected the writing of the letter. Closer in point is
            Branti v. Finkel, 445 U. S. 507 (1980), also cited by the Court, but there the act
            complained of was the dismissal of Republican assistants by the newly appointed
            Democratic public defender. Objective evidence&#x97;the discharging of members of one
            party by the newly appointed supervisor of another party, and their replacement by
            members of the supervisor's party&#x97;would likely have served to defeat a claim of
            qualified immunity had the defendant official attempted to offer a legitimate reason for
            firing the Republican assistants. Thus, the defendants in neither Pickering nor Branti
            would have been entitled to qualified immunity under the approach that I propose.</p>
         <p>Still more distantly related to the facts of the present case are what I would call
            primary First Amendment cases, where the constitutional claim does not depend on motive
            at all. Examples of these are Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844
            (1997) (finding portions of the Communications Decency Act unconstitutional under the
            First <span class="star-pagination">*608</span> Amendment); Barnes v. Glen Theatre,
            Inc., 501 U. S. 560 (1991) (concluding that Indiana statute regulating nude dancing did
            not violate First Amendment); Brown v. Hartlage, 456 U. S. 45 (1982) (invalidating
            Kentucky statute that limited the speech of candidates for office); Nebraska Press Assn.
            v. Stuart, 427 U. S. 539 (1976) (invalidating judge's order prohibiting reporting or
            commentary on murder trial); Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546
            (1975) (finding denial of permission to use municipal theater for showing of Hair to be
            unconstitutional prior restraint); New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713
            (1971) (per curiam) (refusing to enjoin publication of contents of classified
            study).</p>
         <p>The great body of our cases involving freedom of speech would, therefore, be unaffected
            by this approach to qualified immunity. It would apply prototypically to a case such as
            the present one: A public official is charged with doing a routine act in the normal
            course of her duties&#x97;an act that by itself has absolutely no connection with
            freedom of speech&#x97;but she is charged with having performed that act out of a desire
            to retaliate against the plaintiff because of his previous exercise of his right to
            speak freely. In this case, there was surely a legitimate reason for respondent's
            action, and there is no evidence in the record before us that shows it to be pretextual.
            Under the Court's view, only a factfinder's ultimate determination of the motive with
            which she acted will resolve this case. I think the modest extension of Harlow which I
            propose should result in a judgment of qualified immunity for respondent.</p>
         <p>Also relevant to a consideration of the costs my proposed rule would incur is that this
            suit is a request for damages brought under § 1983. If the purpose of § 1983 is to
            "deter state actors from using the badge of their authority to deprive individuals of
            their federally guaranteed rights and to provide relief to victims if such deterrence
            fails," it is hard to see how that purpose is substantially advanced if petitioner's
               <span class="star-pagination">*609</span> suit is allowed to proceed. Wyatt v.Cole,
            504 U. S., at 161. Petitioner has already fully exercised his "federally guaranteed
            rights." Providing compensation to him, even if his claim is meritorious, will foster
            increased constitutional freedoms only for the hypothetical subsequent individual who,
            given the imposition of liability in this case, will not be deterred from exercising his
            First Amendment rights out of fear that respondent would retaliate by misdirecting his
            belongings.</p>
         <p>The costs of the extension of Harlow that I propose would therefore be minor. The
            benefits would be significant, and we have recognized them before. As noted above,
            inquiries into the subjective state of mind of government officials are "peculiarly
            disruptive of effective government" and the threat of such inquiries will in some
            instances cause conscientious officials to shrink from making difficult choices.<span
               class="sup">[3]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The policy arguments thus point strongly in favor of extending immunity in the manner I
            suggest. The Court's opinion, however, suggests a second reason why this rule might be
            unnecessary. The Court assumes that district court judges alert to the dangers of
            allowing these claims <span class="star-pagination">*610</span> to proceed can protect
            defendants by judicious and skillful manipulation of the Federal Rules of Civil
            Procedure. Ante, at 597-601. I have no doubt that, as a general matter, district court
            judges are entirely capable in this regard. But whether a defendant is entitled to
            protection against the "peculiarly disruptive" inquiry into subjective intent should not
            depend on the willingness or ability of a particular district court judge to limit
            inquiry through creative application of the Federal Rules. The scope of protection
            should not vary depending on the district in which the plaintiff brings his suit. Cf.
            Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S., at 643 ("An immunity that has as many variants as
            there are modes of official action and types of rights would not give conscientious
            officials that assurance of protection that it is the object of the doctrine to
            provide"). Indeed, the inconsistency with which some District Courts had applied the
            Wood v. Strickland subjective good-faith inquiry was one of the reasons why the Harlow
            Court stripped qualified immunity of its subjective component. Harlow, 457 U. S., at 816
            ("And an official's subjective good faith has been considered to be a question of fact
            that some courts have regarded as inherently requiring resolution by a jury").</p>
         <p>My proposed rule would supply officials with the consistency and predictability that
            Harlow and its progeny have identified as an underlying purpose of qualified immunity
            doctrine, without eliminating motive-based torts altogether. The Court's solution, which
            is dependent on the varying approaches of 700-odd district court judges, simply will
            not; at the end of the day, many cases will still depend on a factfinder's decision as
            to motivation. No future defendant in respondent's position can know with any certainty
            that the simple act of delivering a prisoner's belongings in one way rather than another
            will not result in an extensive investigation of her state of mind at the time she did
            so. This result is simply not faithful to Harlow `s underlying concerns.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*611</span> Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas
            joins, dissenting.</p>
         <p>As I have observed earlier, our treatment of qualified immunity under 42 U. S. C. § 1983
            has not purported to be faithful to the common-law immunities that existed when § 1983
            was enacted, and that the statute presumably intended to subsume. See Burns v. Reed, 500
            U. S. 478, 498, n. 1 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting
            in part). That is perhaps just as well. The § 1983 that the Court created in 1961 bears
            scant resemblance to what Congress enacted almost a century earlier. I refer, of course,
            to the holding of Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 (1961), which converted an 1871 statute
            covering constitutional violations committed "under color of any statute, ordinance,
            regulation, custom, or usage of any State," Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U. S. C. § 1983
            (emphasis added), into a statute covering constitutional violations committed without
            the authority of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State, and
            indeed even constitutional violations committed in stark violation of state civil or
            criminal law. See Monroe, 365 U. S., at 183; id., at 224-225 (Frankfurter, J.,
            dissenting). As described in detail by the concurring opinion of Judge Silberman in this
            case, see 93 F. 3d 813, 829 (CADC 1996), Monroe changed a statute that had generated
            only 21 cases in the first 50 years of its existence into one that pours into the
            federal courts tens of thousands of suits each year, and engages this Court in a losing
            struggle to prevent the Constitution from degenerating into a general tort law. (The
            present suit, involving the constitutional violation of misdirecting a package, is a
            good enough example.) Applying normal common-law rules to the statute that Monroe
            created would carry us further and further from what any sane Congress could have
            enacted.</p>
         <p>We find ourselves engaged, therefore, in the essentially legislative activity of
            crafting a sensible scheme of qualified <span class="star-pagination">*612</span>
            immunities for the statute we have invented&#x97;rather than applying the common law
            embodied in the statute that Congress wrote. My preference is, in undiluted form, the
            approach suggested by Judge Silberman's concurring opinion in the Court of Appeals:
            extending the "objective reasonableness" test of Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800
            (1982), to qualified immunity insofar as it relates to intent-based constitutional
            torts.</p>
         <p>The Chief Justice's opinion sets forth a test that is "along the lines suggested by
            Judge Silberman," ante, at 602, but that differs in a significant respect: It would
            allow the introduction of "objective evidence" that the constitutionally valid reason
            offered for the complained-of action "is actually a pretext." Ibid. This would consist,
            presumably, of objective evidence regarding the state official's subjective
            intent&#x97;for example, remarks showing that he had a partisanpolitical animus against
            the plaintiff. The admission of such evidence produces a less subjective-free immunity
            than the one established by Harlow. Under that case, once the trial court finds that the
            constitutional right was not well established, it will not admit any "objective
            evidence" that the defendant knew he was violating the Constitution. The test I favor
            would apply a similar rule here: once the trial court finds that the asserted grounds
            for the official action were objectively valid (e. g., the person fired for alleged
            incompetence was indeed incompetent), it would not admit any proof that something other
            than those reasonable grounds was the genuine motive (e. g., the incompetent person
            fired was a Republican). This is of course a more severe restriction upon "intent-based"
            constitutional torts; I am less put off by that consequence than some may be, since I
            believe that no "intent-based" constitutional tort would have been actionable under the
            § 1983 that Congress enacted.</p>

            front-page Washington Post article quoted petitioner as saying that litigious prisoners
            had been "handpicked" for transfer to Spokane "so our lawsuits will be dismissed on

         <p>"1.In cases where plaintiffs bring civil rights claims against Government officials who

            complaint or face dismissal prior to discovery? If so, should it be done?</p>
         <p>"2.May this circuit require that plaintiffs who allege that Government officials acted
            with unconstitutional intent plead direct, as opposed to circumstantial evidence of that
            intent?If so,should it be done?" App. to Pet. for Cert. 108a.</p>
         <p>[4] The questions regarding summary judgment asked: </p>
         <p>"3. In claims of constitutional tort where the unlawfulness depends on the actor's
            unconstitutional motive and the defendant enjoys qualified immunity, should the court
            grant a defense motion for summary judgment, made before plaintiff has conducted
            discovery, if the plaintiff has failed to adduce evidence from which the fact finder
            could reasonably infer the illicit motive? See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800,
            815-18 (1982); Elliott v. Thomas, 937 F. 2d 338, 345-46 (7th Cir. 1991)?</p>
         <p>"4. In claims of constitutional tort where the unlawfulness depends on the actor's
            unconstitutional motive and the defendant enjoys qualified immunity, are there any
            circumstances, apart from national security issues of the sort at stake in Halperin v.
            Kissinger, 807 F. 2d 180, 184-85 (D. C. Cir. 1986), where the court should grant a
            defense motion for summary judgment on a showing by the defendant such that a reasonable
            jury would necessarily conclude that the defendant's stated motivation `would have been
            reasonable'? Id. at 188; see also id. at 189 (summary judgment warranted where no
            reasonable jury could find that `it was objectively unreasonable for the defendants' to
            be acting for stated, innocent motives)." Id., at 108a&#x97;109a.</p>
         <p>[5] On this point, the court disavowed its prior direct-evidence rule of Martin v. D. C.
            Metropolitan Police Department, 812 F. 2d 1425, 1435 (CADC 1987), and Siegert v. Gilley,

         <p>[10] There as on why such retaliation offends the Constitution is that it threatens to
            inhibit exercise of the protected right.Pickering, 391 U. S., at 574. Retaliation is
            thus akin to an "unconstitutional condition" demanded for the receipt of a
            government-provided benefit.See Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593, 597 (1972).</p>
         <p>[11] See Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U. S. 226, 232 (1991) (observing that "the determination
            of whether the plaintiff has asserted a violation of a constitutional right at all" is a
            "necessary concomitant" to the threshold immunity question). Indeed, when Justice
            Ginsburg was a judge on the District of Columbia Circuit, she commented: "Had the Court
            [in Harlow ] intended its formulation of the qualified immunity defense to foreclose all
            inquiry into the defendants' state of mind, the Court might have instructed the entry of
            judgment for defendants Harlow and Butterfield on the constitutional claim without
            further ado. In fact, the Court returned the case to the district court in an open-ended
            remand, a disposition hardly consistent with a firm intent to delete the state of mind
            inquiry from every constitutional tort calculus." Martin, 812 F. 2d, at 1432. </p>
         <p>This correct understanding explains why Harlow does not support the change in the law
            advocated by The Chief Justice, post, at 602.</p>
         <p>[12] "These social costs include the expenses of litigation, the diversion of official
            energy from pressing public issues, and the deterrence of able citizens from acceptance
            of public office. Finally, there is the danger that fear of being sued will `dampen the
            ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible [public officials], in the
            unflinching discharge of their duties.' Gregoire v. Biddle, 177 F. 2d 579, 581 (CA2
            1949), cert. denied, 339 U. S. 949 (1950)." Harlow, 457 U. S., at 814.</p>
         <p>[13] Our opinion in Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232 (1974), explicitly identified
            fairness as an important concern: "This official immunity apparently rested, in its
            genesis, on two mutually dependent rationales: (1) the injustice, particularly in the
            absence of bad faith, of subjecting to liability an officer who is required, by the
            legal obligations of his position, to exercise discretion; (2) the danger that the
            threat of such liability would deter his willingness to execute his office with the
            decisiveness and the judgment required by the public good." Id., at 239-240 (footnote
            omitted). Fairness alone is not, however, a sufficient reason for the immunity defense,
            and thus does not justify its extension to private parties. Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S.
            158, 168 (1992).</p>
         <p>[14] These various protections may not entirely foreclose discovery on the issue of
            motive, and the Court of Appeals adopted its heightened proof standard in large part to
            facilitate the resolution of summary judgment motions before any discovery at all.
            Discovery involving public officials is indeed one of the evils that Harlow aimed to
            address, but neither that opinion nor subsequent decisions create an immunity from all
            discovery. Harlow sought to protect officials from the costs of "broad-reaching"
            discovery, 457 U. S., at 818, and we have since recognized that limited discovery may
            sometimes be necessary before the district court can resolve a motion for summary
            judgment based on qualified immunity. Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 646, n. 6
            (1987); see also Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 526 (1985).</p>
         <p>[15] Though our opinion in Harlow was forthright in revising the immunity defense for
            policy reasons, see Anderson, 483 U. S., at 645, that decision nonetheless followed
            recent Court precedent and simply eliminated one aspect of the established doctrine; it
            did not create a new immunity standard out of whole cloth.</p>
         <p>[16] Ironically, the heightened standard of proof directly limits the availability of
            the remedy in cases involving the specific evil at which the Civil Rights Act of 1871
            (the predecessor of § 1983) was originally aimed&#x97;race discrimination. See Monroe v.
            Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 174-175 (1961).</p>
         <p>[17] In his dissent in Harris v. Pate, 440 F. 2d 315 (CA7 1971), Judge Hastings wrote in
            reference to the "ever increasing volume of frivolous civil actions filed by state
            custodial prisoners" that "[o]f course, most prisoners would enjoy a holiday in court."
            Id., at 320.</p>
         <p>[18] Despite the continuing rise in the state and federal prison populations, the number
            of prisoner civil rights suits filed in federal court dropped from 41,215 in fiscal year
            1996 (Oct. 1, 1995&#x97;Sept. 30, 1996) to 28,635 in fiscal year 1997 (Oct. 1,
            1996&#x97;Sept. 30, 1997), a decline of 31 percent. Administrative Office of the United
            States Courts, L. Mecham, Judicial Business of the United States Courts: 1997 Report of
            the Director 131-132 (Table C-2A).</p>
         <p>[19] If the district court enters an order denying the defendant's motion for dismissal
            or summary judgment, the official is entitled to bring an immediate interlocutory appeal
            of that legal ruling on the immunity question. Johnson v. Jones, 515 U. S. 304, 313,
            319-320 (1995).</p>
         <p>[20] The judge does, however, have discretion to postpone ruling on a defendant's
            summary judgment motion if the plaintiff needs additional discovery to explore "facts
            essential to justify the party's opposition." Rule 56(f).</p>
         <p>[21] If the official seeks summary judgment on immunity grounds and the court denies the
            motion, the official can take an immediate interlocutory appeal, even if she has already
            so appealed a prior order. Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U. S. 299, 311 (1996).</p>
         <p>[22] "Of course, a party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial
            responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and
            identifying those portions of `the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,
            and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,' which it believes
            demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,
            477 U. S. 317, 323 (1986) (quoting Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c)).</p>
         <p>[1] The Court suggests that the Wood v. Strickland subjective inquiry that we stripped
            from the qualified immunity analysis in Harlow is somehow different from the inquiry
            into subjective intent involved in resolution of a motive-based tort claim. Ante, at
            592. While the inquiries may differ somewhat in terms of what precisely is being asked,
            this difference is without relevance for the purposes of qualified immunity doctrine.
            Both inquiries allow a plaintiff to probe the official's state of mind, and therefore
            both types of inquiry have the potential to be "peculiarly disruptive" to effective
            government.</p>
         <p>[2] This result also threatens to "Balkanize" the rule of qualified immunity. Anderson
            v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 646, 643 (1987) ("[W]e have been unwilling to complicate
            qualified immunity analysis by making the scope or extent of immunity turn on the
            precise nature of various officials' duties or the precise character of the particular
            rights alleged to have been violated. An immunity that has as many variants as there are
            modes of official action and types of rights would not give conscientious officials that
            assurance of protection that it is the object of the doctrine to provide").</p>
         <p>[3] This point has perhaps been made most elegantly by Judge Learned Hand, who, in an
            oft-cited passage, wrote: </p>
         <p>"It does indeed go without saying that an official, who is in fact guilty of using his
            powers to vent his spleen upon others . . . should not escape liability for the injuries
            he may so cause; and, if it were possible in practice to confine such complaints to the
            guilty, it would be monstrous to deny recovery. The justification for doing so is that
            it is impossible to know whether the claim is well founded until the case has been
            tried, and that to submit all officials, the innocent as well as the guilty, to the
            burden of a trial and to the inevitable danger of its outcome, would dampen the ardor of
            all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible, in the unflinching discharge of
            their duties. . . . As is so often the case, the answer must be found in a balance
            between the evils inevitable in either alternative. In this instance it has been thought
            in the end better to leave unredressed the wrongs done by dishonest officers than to
            subject those who try to do their duty to the constant dread of retaliation." Gregoire
            v. Biddle, 177 F. 2d 579, 581 (CA2 1949), cert. denied, 339 U. S. 949 (1950).</p>
