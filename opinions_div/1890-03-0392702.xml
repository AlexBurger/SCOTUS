            <span class="star-pagination">*9</span> Mr. Walter H. Rogers, Attorney General of the
            State of Louisiana, Mr. M.J. Cunningham, Mr. B.J. Sage and Mr. Alexander Porter Morse,
            for defendant in error, submitted on their briefs.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*8</span> MR. JUSTICE BRADLEY, after stating the case as
            above, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
         <p>The question is presented, whether a State can be sued in a Circuit Court of the United
            States by one of its own citizens upon a suggestion that the case is one that arises
            under the Constitution or laws of the United States.</p>
         <p>The ground taken is, that under the Constitution, as well as under the act of Congress
            passed to carry it into effect, a case is within the jurisdiction of the federal courts,
            without regard to the character of the parties, if it arises under the Constitution or
            laws of the United States, or, which is the same thing, if it necessarily involves a
            question under said Constitution or laws. The language relied on is that clause of the
            3d article of the Constitution, which declares that "the judicial power of the United
            States shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this Constitution, the
            laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their
            authority;" and the corresponding clause of the act conferring jurisdiction upon the
            Circuit Court, which, as found in the act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 470, c. 137, § 1,
            is as follows, to wit: "That the Circuit Courts of the United States shall have original
            cognizance, concurrent with the courts of the several states, of all suits of a civil
            nature at common law or in equity, ... arising under the Constitution or laws of the
            United States, or treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority." It is
            said that these jurisdictional clauses make no exception arising from the character of
            the parties, and, therefore, that a State can claim no exemption from suit, if the case
            is really one arising under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States. It
            is conceded that where the jurisdiction depends alone upon the character of the parties,
            a controversy between a State and its own <span class="star-pagination">*10</span>
            citizens is not embraced within it; but it is contended that though jurisdiction does
            not exist on that ground, it nevertheless does exist if the case itself is one which
            necessarily involves a federal question; and with regard to ordinary parties this is
            undoubtedly true. The question now to be decided is, whether it is true where one of the
            parties is a State, and is sued as a defendant by one of its own citizens.</p>
         <p>That a State cannot be sued by a citizen of another State, or of a foreign state, on the
            mere ground that the case is one arising under the Constitution or laws of the United
            States, is clearly established by the decisions of this court in several recent cases.
            Louisiana v. Jumel, 107 U.S. 711; Hagood v. Southern, 117 U.S. 52; In re Ayers, <span
               class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/tne/in-re-ayers/">
                  <span class="volume">123</span>
                  <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
                  <span class="page">443</span>
               </a>
            </span>. Those were cases arising under the Constitution of the United States, upon laws
            complained of as impairing the obligation of contracts, one of which was the
            constitutional amendment of Louisiana complained of in the present case. Relief was
            sought against state officers who professed to act in obedience to those laws. This
            court held that the suits were virtually against the States themselves and were
            consequently violative of the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution, and could not be
            maintained. It was not denied that they presented cases arising under the Constitution;
            but, notwithstanding that, they were held to be prohibited by the amendment referred
            to.</p>
         <p>In the present case the plaintiff in error contends that he, being a citizen of
            Louisiana, is not embarrassed by the obstacle of the Eleventh Amendment, inasmuch as
            that amendment only prohibits suits against a State which are brought by the citizens of
            another State, or by citizens or subjects of a foreign State. It is true, the amendment
            does so read: and if there were no other reason or ground for abating his suit, it might
            be maintainable; and then we should have this anomalous result, that in cases arising
            under the Constitution or laws of the United States, a State may be sued in the federal
            courts by its own citizens, though it cannot be sued for a like cause of action by the
            citizens of other States, or of a foreign state; and may be thus sued in the federal
            courts, although not allowing itself to be sued in its own courts. If this is the
            necessary <span class="star-pagination">*11</span> consequence of the language of the
            Constitution and the law, the result is no less startling and unexpected than was the
            original decision of this court, that under the language of the Constitution and of the
            judiciary act of 1789, a State was liable to be sued by a citizen of another State, or
            of a foreign country. That decision was made in the case of Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall.
            419, and created such a shock of surprise throughout the country that, at the first
            meeting of Congress thereafter, the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution was almost
            unanimously proposed, and was in due course adopted by the legislatures of the States.
            This amendment, expressing the will of the ultimate sovereignty of the whole country,
            superior to all legislatures and all courts, actually reversed the decision of the
            Supreme Court. It did not in terms prohibit suits by individuals against the States, but
            declared that the Constitution should not be construed to import any power to authorize
            the bringing of such suits. The language of the amendment is that "the judicial power of
            the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,
            commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another State or
            by citizens or subjects of any foreign state." The Supreme Court had construed the
            judicial power as extending to such a suit, and its decision was thus overruled. The
            court itself so understood the effect of the amendment, for, after its adoption,
            Attorney General Lee, in the case of Hollingsworth v. Virginia, 3 Dall. 378, submitted
            this question to the court, "whether the amendment did, or did not, supersede all suits
            depending, as well as prevent the institution of new suits, against any one of the
            United States, by citizens of another State?" Tilghman and Rawle argued in the negative,
            contending that the jurisdiction of the court was unimpaired in relation to all suits
            instituted previously to the adoption of the amendment. But, on the succeeding day, the
            court delivered a unanimous opinion, "that the amendment being constitutionally adopted,
            there could not be exercised any jurisdiction, in any case, past or future, in which a
            State was sued by the citizens of another State, or by citizens or subjects of any
            foreign state."</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*12</span> This view of the force and meaning of the
            amendment is important. It shows that, on this question of the suability of the States
            by individuals, the highest authority of this country was in accord rather with the
            minority than with the majority of the court in the decision of the case of Chisholm v.
            Georgia; and this fact lends additional interest to the able opinion of Mr. Justice
            Iredell on that occasion. The other justices were more swayed by a close observance of
            the letter of the Constitution, without regard to former experience and usage; and
            because the letter said that the judicial power shall extend to controversies "between a
            State and citizens of another State;" and "between a State and foreign states, citizens
            or subjects," they felt constrained to see in this language a power to enable the
            individual citizens of one State, or of a foreign state, to sue another State of the
            Union in the federal courts. Justice Iredell, on the contrary, contended that it was not
            the intention to create new and unheard of remedies, by subjecting sovereign States to
            actions at the suit of individuals, (which he conclusively showed was never done
            before,) but only, by proper legislation, to invest the federal courts with jurisdiction
            to hear and determine controversies and cases, between the parties designated, that were
            properly susceptible of litigation in courts.</p>
         <p>Looking back from our present standpoint at the decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, we do
            not greatly wonder at the effect which it had upon the country. Any such power as that
            of authorizing the federal judiciary to entertain suits by individuals against the
            States, had been expressly disclaimed, and even resented, by the great defenders of the
            Constitution whilst it was on its trial before the American people. As some of their
            utterances are directly pertinent to the question now under consideration, we deem it
            proper to quote them.</p>
         <p>The eighty-first number of the Federalist, written by Hamilton, has the following
            profound remarks:</p>
         <p>"It has been suggested that an assignment of the public securities of one State to the
            citizens of another, would enable them to prosecute that State in the federal courts for
            the amount of those securities; a suggestion which the following considerations prove to
            be without foundation:</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*13</span> "It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty
            not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent. This is the general
            sense and the general practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of the attributes
            of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every State in the Union. Unless,
            therefore, there is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it will
            remain with the States, and the danger intimated must be merely ideal. The circumstances
            which are necessary to produce an alienation of state sovereignty were discussed in
            considering the article of taxation, and need not be repeated here. A recurrence to the
            principles there established will satisfy us, that there is no color to pretend that the
            state governments would, by the adoption of that plan, be divested of the privilege of
            paying their own debts in their own way, free from every constraint but that which flows
            from the obligations of good faith. The contracts between a nation and individuals are
            only binding on the conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretension to a compulsive
            force. They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign will. To what purpose
            would it be to authorize suits against States for the debts they owe? How could
            recoveries be enforced? It is evident that it could not be done without waging war
            against the contracting State; and to ascribe to the federal courts by mere implication,
            and in destruction of a pre-existing right of the state governments, a power which would
            involve such a consequence, would be altogether forced and unwarrantable."</p>
         <p>The obnoxious clause to which Hamilton's argument was directed, and which was the ground
            of the objections which he so forcibly met, was that which declared that "the judicial
            power shall extend to all ... controversies between a State and citizens of another
            State, ... and between a State and foreign states, citizens or subjects." It was argued
            by the opponents of the Constitution that this clause would authorize jurisdiction to be
            given to the federal courts to entertain suits against a State brought by the citizens
            of another State, or of a foreign state. Adhering to the mere letter, it might be so;
            and so, in fact, the Supreme Court held in Chisholm v. <span class="star-pagination"
               >*14</span> Georgia; but looking at the subject as Hamilton did, and as Mr. Justice
            Iredell did, in the light of history and experience and the established order of things,
            the views of the latter were clearly right, &#x97; as the people of the United States in
            their sovereign capacity subsequently decided.</p>
         <p>But Hamilton was not alone in protesting against the construction put upon the
            Constitution by its opponents. In the Virginia convention the same objections were
            raised by George Mason and Patrick Henry, and were met by Madison and Marshall as
            follows. Madison said: "Its jurisdiction [the federal jurisdiction] in controversies
            between a State and citizens of another State is much objected to, and perhaps without
            reason. It is not in the power of individuals to call any State into court. The only
            operation it can have is that, if a State should wish to bring a suit against a citizen,
            it must be brought before the federal court. This will give satisfaction to individuals,
            as it will prevent citizens on whom a State may have a claim being dissatisfied with the
            state courts... . It appears to me that this [clause] can have no operation but this
            &#x97; to give a citizen a right to be heard in the federal courts; and if a State
            should condescend to be a party, this court may take cognizance of it." 3 Elliott's
            Debates, 2d ed. 533. Marshall, in answer to the same objection, said: "With respect to
            disputes between a State and the citizens of another State, its jurisdiction has been
            decried with unusual vehemence. I hope that no gentleman will think that a State will be
            called at the bar of the federal court... . It is not rational to suppose that the
            sovereign power should be dragged before a court. The intent is to enable States to
            recover claims of individuals residing in other States... . But, say they, there will be
            partiality in it if a State cannot be defendant &#x97; if an individual cannot proceed
            to obtain judgment against a State, though he may be sued by a State. It is necessary to
            be so, and cannot be avoided. I see a difficulty in making a State defendant which does
            not prevent its being plaintiff." Ib. 555.</p>
         <p>It seems to us that these views of those great advocates and defenders of the
            Constitution were most sensible and just; and <span class="star-pagination">*15</span>
            they apply equally to the present case as to that then under discussion. The letter is
            appealed to now, as it was then, as a ground for sustaining a suit brought by an
            individual against a State. The reason against it is as strong in this case as it was in
            that. It is an attempt to strain the Constitution and the law to a construction never
            imagined or dreamed of. Can we suppose that, when the Eleventh Amendment was adopted, it
            was understood to be left open for citizens of a State to sue their own state in the
            federal courts, whilst the idea of suits by citizens of other states, or of foreign
            states, was indignantly repelled? Suppose that Congress, when proposing the Eleventh
            Amendment, had appended to it a proviso that nothing therein contained should prevent a
            State from being sued by its own citizens in cases arising under the Constitution or
            laws of the United States: can we imagine that it would have been adopted by the States?
            The supposition that it would is almost an absurdity on its face.</p>
         <p>The truth is, that the cognizance of suits and actions unknown to the law, and forbidden
            by the law, was not contemplated by the Constitution when establishing the judicial
            power of the United States. Some things, undoubtedly, were made justiciable which were
            not known as such at the common law; such, for example, as controversies between States
            as to boundary lines, and other questions admitting of judicial solution. And yet the
            case of Penn v. Lord Baltimore, 1 Ves. Sen. 444, shows that some of these unusual
            subjects of litigation were not unknown to the courts even in colonial times; and
            several cases of the same general character arose under the Articles of Confederation,
            and were brought before the tribunal provided for that purpose in those articles. 131
            U.S. App. 1. The establishment of this new branch of jurisdiction seemed to be necessary
            from the extinguishment of diplomatic relations between the States. Of other
            controversies between a State and another State or its citizens, which, on the settled
            principles of public law, are not subjects of judicial cognizance, this court has often
            declined to take jurisdiction. See Wisconsin v. Pelican Ins. Co., <span class="citation">

            <span class="star-pagination">*16</span> The suability of a State without its consent
            was a thing unknown to the law. This has been so often laid down and acknowledged by
            courts and jurists that it is hardly necessary to be formally asserted. It was fully
            shown by an exhaustive examination of the old law by Mr. Justice Iredell in his opinion
            in Chisholm v. Georgia; and it has been conceded in every case since, where the question
            has, in any way, been presented, even in the cases which have gone farthest in
            sustaining suits against the officers or agents of States. Osborn v. Bank of United
            States, 9 Wheat. 738; Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203; Board of Liquidation v. McComb, 92
            U.S. 531; United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196; Poindexter v. Greenhow, 109 U.S. 63;
            Virginia Coupon Cases, 114 U.S. 269. In all these cases the effort was to show, and the
            court held, that the suits were not against the State or the United States, but against
            the individuals; conceding that if they had been against either the State or the United
            States, they could not be maintained.</p>
         <p>Mr. Webster stated the law with precision in his letter to Baring Brothers &amp;amp;
            Co., of October 16, 1839. Works, Vol. VI, 537, 539. "The security for state loans," he
            said, "is the plighted faith of the State as a political community. It rests on the same
            basis as other contracts with established governments, the same basis, for example, as
            loans made by the United States under the authority of Congress; that is to say, the
            good faith of the government making the loan, and its ability to fulfil its
            engagements."</p>

            liable to be sued? ... No sovereign State is liable to be sued without her consent.
            Under the Articles of Confederation, a State could be sued only in cases of boundary. It
            is believed that there is no case where a suit has been brought, at any time, on bills
            of credit against a State; and it is certain that no suit could have been maintained on
            this ground prior to the Constitution."</p>

            </span>, 529, that the State could repeal that law at any time; that it was not a
            contract within the terms of the constitution prohibiting the passage of state laws
            impairing the obligation of a contract. In that case the law allowing the State to be
            sued was modified, pending certain suits against the State on its bonds, so as to
            require the bonds to be filed in court, which was objected to as an unconstitutional
            change of the law. Chief Justice Taney, delivering the opinion of the court, said: "It
            is an established principle of jurisprudence in all civilized nations that the sovereign
            cannot be sued in its own courts, or in any other, without its consent and permission;
            but it may, if it thinks proper, waive this privilege and permit itself to be made a
            defendant in a suit by individuals, or by another State. And as this permission is
            altogether voluntary on the part of the sovereignty, it follows that it may prescribe
            the terms and conditions on which it consents to be sued, and the manner in which the
            suit shall be conducted, and may withdraw its consent whenever it may suppose that
            justice to the public requires it... . The prior law was not a contract. It was an
            ordinary act of legislation, prescribing the conditions upon which the State consented
            to waive the privilege of sovereignty. It contained no stipulation that these
            regulations should not be modified afterwards if, upon experience, it was found that
            further provisions were <span class="star-pagination">*18</span> necessary to protect
            the public interest; and no such contract can be implied from the law, nor can this
            court inquire whether the law operated hardly or unjustly upon the parties whose suits
            were then pending. That was a question for the consideration of the legislature. They
            might have repealed the prior law altogether, and put an end to the jurisdiction of
            their courts in suits against the State, if they had thought proper to do so, or
            prescribe new conditions upon which the suits might still be allowed to proceed. In
            exercising this power the State violated no contract with the parties." The same

         <p>But besides the presumption that no anomalous and unheard-of proceedings or suits were
            intended to be raised up by the Constitution &#x97; anomalous and unheard of when the
            Constitution was adopted &#x97; an additional reason why the jurisdiction claimed for
            the Circuit Court does not exist, is the language of the act of Congress by which its
            jurisdiction is conferred. The words are these: "The circuit courts of the United States
            shall have original cognizance, concurrent with the courts of the several States, of all
            suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity, ... arising under the Constitution
            or laws of the United States, or treaties," etc. &#x97; "Concurrent with the courts of
            the several States." Does not this qualification, show that Congress, in legislating to
            carry the Constitution into effect, did not intend to invest its courts with any new and
            strange jurisdictions? The state courts have no power to entertain suits by individuals
            against a State without its consent. Then how does the Circuit Court, having only
            concurrent jurisdiction, acquire any such power? It is true that the same qualification
            existed in the judiciary act of 1789, which was before the court in Chisholm v. Georgia,
            and the majority of the court did not think that it was sufficient to limit the
            jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. Justice Iredell thought differently. In view of the
            manner in which that decision was received by the country, the adoption of the Eleventh
            Amendment, the light of history and the reason of the thing, we <span
               class="star-pagination">*19</span> think we are at liberty to prefer Justice
            Iredell's views in this regard.</p>
         <p>Some reliance is placed by the plaintiff upon the observations of Chief Justice

            </span>, 410. The Chief Justice was there considering the power of review exercisable by
            this court over the judgments of a state court, wherein it might be necessary to make
            the State itself a defendant in error. He showed that this power was absolutely
            necessary in order to enable the judiciary of the United States to take cognizance of
            all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. He also showed
            that making a State a defendant in error was entirely different from suing a State in an
            original action in prosecution of a demand against it, and was not within the meaning of
            the Eleventh Amendment; that the prosecution of a writ of error against a State was not
            the prosecution of a suit in the sense of that amendment, which had reference to the
            prosecution, by suit, of claims against a State. "Where," said the Chief Justice, "a
            State obtains a judgment against an individual, and the court rendering such judgment
            overrules a defence set up under the Constitution or laws of the United States, the
            transfer of this record into the Supreme Court for the sole purpose of inquiring whether
            the judgment violates the Constitution of the United States, can, with no propriety, we
            think, be denominated a suit commenced or prosecuted against the State whose judgment is
            so far reëxamined. Nothing is demanded from the State. No claim against it of any
            description is asserted or prosecuted. The party is not to be restored to the possession
            of any thing... . He only asserts the constitutional right to have his defence examined
            by that tribunal whose province it is to construe the Constitution and laws of the
            Union... . The point of view in which this writ of error, with its citation, has been
            considered uniformly in the courts of the Union, has been well illustrated by a
            reference to the course of this court in suits instituted by the United States. The
            universally received opinion is that no suit can be commenced or prosecuted against the
            United States; that the judiciary act does not authorize such suits. <span
               class="star-pagination">*20</span> Yet writs of error, accompanied with citations,
            have uniformly issued for the removal of judgments in favor of the United States into a
            superior court... . It has never been suggested that such writ of error was a suit
            against the United States, and, therefore, not within the jurisdiction of the appellate
            court."</p>
         <p>After thus showing by incontestable argument that a writ of error to a judgment
            recovered by a State, in which the State is necessarily the defendant in error, is not a
            suit commenced or prosecuted against a State in the sense of the amendment, he added,
            that if the court were mistaken in this, its error did not affect that case, because the
            writ of error therein was not prosecuted by "a citizen of another State" or "of any
            foreign state," and so was not affected by the amendment; but was governed by the
            general grant of judicial power, as extending "to all cases arising under the
            Constitution or laws of the United States, without respect to parties." p. 412.</p>
         <p>It must be conceded that the last observation of the Chief Justice does favor the
            argument of the plaintiff. But the observation was unnecessary to the decision, and in
            that sense extra judicial, and though made by one who seldom used words without due
            reflection, ought not to outweigh the important considerations referred to which lead to
            a different conclusion. With regard to the question then before the court, it may be
            observed, that writs of error to judgments in favor of the crown, or of the State, had
            been known to the law from time immemorial; and had never been considered as exceptions
            to the rule, that an action does not lie against the sovereign.</p>
         <p>To avoid misapprehension it may be proper to add that, although the obligations of a
            State rest for their performance upon its honor and good faith, and cannot be made the
            subjects of judicial cognizance unless the State consents to be sued, or comes itself
            into court; yet where property or rights are enjoyed under a grant or contract made by a
            State, they cannot wantonly be invaded. Whilst the State cannot be compelled by suit to
            perform its contracts, any attempt on its part to violate property or rights acquired
            under its contracts, <span class="star-pagination">*21</span> may be judicially
            resisted; and any law impairing the obligation of contracts under which such property or
            rights are held is void and powerless to affect their enjoyment.</p>
         <p>It is not necessary that we should enter upon an examination of the reason or expediency
            of the rule which exempts a sovereign State from prosecution in a court of justice at
            the suit of individuals. This is fully discussed by writers on public law. It is enough
            for us to declare its existence. The legislative department of a State represents its
            polity and its will; and is called upon by the highest demands of natural and political
            law to preserve justice and judgment, and to hold inviolate the public obligations. Any
            departure from this rule, except for reasons most cogent, (of which the legislature, and
            not the courts, is the judge,) never fails in the end to incur the odium of the world,
            and to bring lasting injury upon the State itself. But to deprive the legislature of the
            power of judging what the honor and safety of the State may require, even at the expense
            of a temporary failure to discharge the public debts, would be attended with greater
            evils than such failure can cause.</p>
         <p>The judgment of the Circuit Court is</p>
         <p>Affirmed.</p></div>
      <div type="concurrence" judge="harlan">
         <p>MR. JUSTICE HARLAN concurring.</p>
         <p>I concur with the court in holding that a suit directly against a State by one of its
            own citizens is not one to which the judicial power of the United States extends, unless
            the State itself consents to be sued. Upon this ground alone I assent to the judgment.
            But I cannot give my assent to many things said in the opinion. The comments made upon
            the decision in Chisholm v. Georgia do not meet my approval. They are not necessary to
            the determination of the present case. Besides, I am of opinion that the decision in
            that case was based upon a sound interpretation of the Constitution as that instrument
            then was.</p>
