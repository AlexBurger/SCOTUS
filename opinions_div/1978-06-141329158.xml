         <p>MR. JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
         <p>A Maryland statute provides that a producer or refiner of petroleum products (1) may not
            operate any retail service station within the State, and (2) must extend all "voluntary
               <span class="star-pagination">*120</span> allowances" uniformly to all service
            stations it supplies.<span class="sup">[1]</span> The questions presented are whether
            the statute violates either the Commerce or the Due Process Clause of the Constitution
            of the United States, or is directly or indirectly pre-empted by the congressional
            expression of policy favoring vigorous competition found in ยง 2 (b) of the Clayton Act,
            38 Stat. 730, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 49 Stat. 1526.<span class="sup"
               >[2]</span> The Court of Appeals of Maryland answered these questions in <span
               class="star-pagination">*121</span> favor of the validity of the statute. 279 Md.
            410, 370 A. 2d 1102 and 372 A. 2d 237 (1977). We affirm.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>The Maryland statute is an outgrowth of the 1973 shortage of petroleum. In response to
            complaints about inequitable distribution of gasoline among retail stations, the
            Governor of Maryland directed the State Comptroller to conduct a market survey. The
            results of that survey indicated that gasoline stations operated by producers or
            refiners had received preferential treatment during the period of short supply. The
            Comptroller therefore proposed legislation which, according to the Court of Appeals, was
            "designed to correct the inequities in the distribution and pricing of gasoline
            reflected by the survey." Id., at 421, 370 A. 2d, at 1109. After legislative hearings
            and a "special veto hearing" before the Governor, the bill was enacted and signed into
            law.</p>
         <p>Shortly before the effective date of the Act, Exxon Corp. filed a declaratory judgment
            action challenging the statute in the Circuit Court of Anne Arundel County, Md. The
            essential facts alleged in the complaint are not in dispute. All of the gasoline sold by
            Exxon in Maryland is transported into the State from refineries located elsewhere.
            Although Exxon sells the bulk of this gas to wholesalers and independent retailers, it
            also sells directly to the consuming public through 36 company-operated stations.<span
               class="sup">[3]</span> Exxon uses these stations to test innovative marketing
            concepts or products.<span class="sup">[4]</span> Focusing primarily on the Act's
            requirement that it discontinue its operation of these 36 retail stations, Exxon's
            complaint challenged the <span class="star-pagination">*122</span> validity of the
            statute on both constitutional and federal statutory grounds.<span class="sup"
               >[5]</span>
         </p>
         <p>During the ensuing nine months, six other oil companies instituted comparable actions.
            Three of these plaintiffs, or their subsidiaries, sell their gasoline in Maryland
            exclusively through company-operated stations.<span class="sup">[6]</span> These
            refiners, using trade names such as "Red Head" and "Scot," concentrate largely on
            high-volume sales with prices consistently lower than those offered by independent
            dealer-operated major brand stations. Testimony presented by these refiners indicated
            that company ownership is essential to their method of private brand, low-priced
            competition. They therefore joined Exxon in its attack on the divestiture provisions of
            the Maryland statute.</p>
         <p>The three other plaintiffs, like Exxon, sell major brands primarily through
            dealer-operated stations, although they also operate at least one retail station
               each.<span class="sup">[7]</span> They, too, challenged the statute's divestiture
            provisions, but, in addition, they specially challenged the requirement that "voluntary
            allowances" be extended uniformly to all retail service stations supplied in the State.
            Although not defined in the statute, the term "voluntary allowances" refers to temporary
            price reductions granted by the oil companies to independent dealers who <span
               class="star-pagination">*123</span> are injured by local competitive price reductions
            of competing retailers.<span class="sup">[8]</span> The oil companies regard these
            temporary allowances as legitimate price reductions protected by ยง 2 (b). In advance of
            trial, Exxon, Shell, and Gulf moved for a partial summary judgment declaring this
            portion of the Act invalid as in conflict with ยง 2 (b).</p>
         <p>The Circuit Court granted the motion, and the trial then focused on the validity of the
            divestiture provisions. As brought out during the trial, the salient characteristics of
            the Maryland retail gasoline market are as follows: Approximately 3,800 retail service
            stations in Maryland sell over 20 different brands of gasoline. However, no petroleum
            products are produced or refined in Maryland, and the number of stations actually
            operated by a refiner or an affiliate is relatively small, representing about 5% of the
            total number of Maryland retailers.</p>
         <p>The refiners introduced evidence indicating that their ownership of retail service
            stations has produced significant benefits for the consuming public.<span class="sup"
               >[9]</span> Moreover, the three refiners that now market solely through
            company-operated stations may elect to withdraw from the Maryland market altogether if
            the statute is enforced. There was, however, no evidence that the total quantity of
            petroleum products shipped into Maryland would be affected by the statute.<span
               class="sup">[10]</span> After trial, the Circuit Court held the entire statute
            invalid, primarily on substantive due process grounds.</p>
         <p>The Maryland Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting all of the refiners' attacks against
            both the divestiture provisions and <span class="star-pagination">*124</span> the
            voluntary-allowance provision. Most of those attacks are not pursued here;<span
               class="sup">[11]</span> instead, appellants have focused their appeals on the claims
            that the Maryland statute violates the Due Process and Commerce Clauses and that it is
            in conflict with the Robinson-Patman Act.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>Appellants' substantive due process argument requires little discussion.<span
               class="sup">[12]</span> The evidence presented by the refiners may cast some doubt on
            the wisdom of the statute, but it is, by now, absolutely clear that the Due Process
            Clause does not empower the judiciary "to sit as a `superlegislature to weigh the wisdom
            of legislation' . . . ." Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 731 (citation omitted).
            Responding to evidence that producers and refiners were favoring company-operated
            stations in the allocation of gasoline and that this would eventually decrease the
            competitiveness of the retail market, the State enacted a law prohibiting producers and
            refiners from operating their own stations. Appellants argue that this response is
            irrational and that it will frustrate rather than further the State's desired goal of
            enhancing competition. But, as the Court of Appeals observed, this argument rests simply
            on an evaluation of the economic wisdom of the statute, 279 Md., at 428, 370 A. 2d, at
            1112, and cannot override the State's authority "to legislate against what are found to
            be injurious practices in their internal commercial and business affairs . . . ."
            Lincoln Federal Labor Union v. Northwestern Iron &amp;amp; Metal Co., 335 U. S. 525,
               536.<span class="sup">[13]</span> Regardless of the ultimate economic <span
               class="star-pagination">*125</span> efficacy of the statute, we have no hesitancy in
            concluding that it bears a reasonable relation to the State's legitimate purpose in
            controlling the gasoline retail market, and we therefore reject appellants' due process
            claim.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>Appellants argue that the divestiture provisions of the Maryland statute violate the
            Commerce Clause in three ways: (1) by discriminating against interstate commerce; (2) by
            unduly burdening interstate commerce; and (3) by imposing controls on a commercial
            activity of such an essentially interstate character that it is not amenable to state
            regulation.</p>
         <p>Plainly, the Maryland statute does not discriminate against interstate goods, nor does
            it favor local producers and refiners. Since Maryland's entire gasoline supply flows in
            interstate commerce and since there are no local producers or refiners, such claims of
            disparate treatment between interstate and local commerce would be meritless.
            Appellants, however, focus on the retail market, arguing that the effect of the statute
            is to protect in-state independent dealers from out-of-state competition. They contend
            that the divestiture provisions "create a protected enclave for Maryland independent
            dealers. . . ."<span class="sup">[14]</span> As support for this proposition, they rely
            on the fact that the burden of the divestiture requirements falls solely on interstate
            companies. But this fact does not lead, either logically or as a practical matter, to a
            conclusion that the State is discriminating against interstate commerce at the retail
            level.</p>
         <p>As the record shows, there are several major interstate marketers of petroleum that own
            and operate their own retail <span class="star-pagination">*126</span> gasoline
               stations.<span class="sup">[15]</span> These interstate dealers, who compete directly
            with the Maryland independent dealers, are not affected by the Act because they do not
            refine or produce gasoline. In fact, the Act creates no barriers whatsoever against
            interstate independent dealers; it does not prohibit the flow of interstate goods, place
            added costs upon them, or distinguishes between in-state and out-of-state companies in
            the retail market. The absence of any of these factors fully distinguishes this case
            from those in which a State has been found to have discriminated against interstate
            commerce. See, e. g., Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333; Dean
            Milk Co. v. Madison, 340 U. S. 349. For instance, the Court in Hunt noted that the
            challenged state statute raised the cost of doing business for out-of-state dealers,
            and, in various other ways, favored the in-state dealer in the local market. 432 U. S.,
            at 351-352. No comparable claim can be made here. While the refiners will no longer
            enjoy their same status in the Maryland market, in-state independent dealers will have
            no competitive advantage over out-of-state dealers. The fact that the burden of a state
            regulation falls on some interstate companies does not, by itself, establish a claim of
            discrimination against interstate commerce.<span class="sup">[16]</span>

            <span class="star-pagination">*127</span> Appellants argue, however, that this fact does
            show that the Maryland statute impermissibly burdens interstate commerce. They point to
            evidence in the record which indicates that, because of the divestiture requirements, at
            least three refiners will stop selling in Maryland, and which also supports their claim
            that the elimination of company-operated stations will deprive the consumer of certain
            special services. Even if we assume the truth of both assertions, neither warrants a
            finding that the statute impermissibly burdens interstate commerce.</p>
         <p>Some refiners may choose to withdraw entirely from the Maryland market, but there is no
            reason to assume that their share of the entire supply will not be promptly replaced by
            other interstate refiners. The source of the consumers' supply may switch from
            company-operated stations to independent dealers, but interstate commerce is not
            subjected to an impermissible burden simply because an otherwise valid regulation causes
            some business to shift from one interstate supplier to another.</p>
         <p>The crux of appellants' claim is that, regardless of whether the State has interfered
            with the movement of goods in interstate commerce, it has interfered "with the natural
            functioning of the interstate market either through prohibition or through burdensome
            regulation." Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 806. Appellants then claim
            that the statute "will surely change the market structure by weakening the independent
            refiners . . . ."<span class="sup">[17]</span> We cannot, however, accept appellants'
            underlying notion that the Commerce Clause protects the particular structure or methods
            of operation in a retail market. See Breard v. Alexandria, 341 U. S. 622. As indicated
            by the Court in Hughes, the Clause protects the interstate market, not particular
            interstate firms, from prohibitive <span class="star-pagination">*128</span> or
            burdensome regulations. It may be true that the consuming public will be injured by the
            loss of the high-volume, low-priced stations operated by the independent refiners, but
            again that argument relates to the wisdom of the statute, not to its burden on
            commerce.</p>
         <p>Finally, we cannot adopt appellants' novel suggestion that because the economic market
            for petroleum products is nation-wide, no State has the power to regulate the retail
            marketing of gas. Appellants point out that many state legislatures have either enacted
            or considered proposals similar to Maryland's,<span class="sup">[18]</span> and that the
            cumulative effect of this sort of legislation may have serious implications for their
            national marketing operations. While this concern is a significant one, we do not find
            that the Commerce Clause, by its own force, pre-empts the field of retail gas marketing.
            To be sure, "the Commerce Clause acts as a limitation upon state power even without
            congressional implementation." Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm'n, supra, at
            350. But this Court has only rarely held that the Commerce Clause itself pre-empts an
            entire field from state regulation, and then only when a lack of national uniformity
            would impede the flow of interstate goods. See Wabash, St. L. &amp;amp; P. R. Co. v.
            Illinois, 118 U. S. 557; see also Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299, 319. The evil
            that appellants perceive in this litigation is not that the several States will enact
            differing regulations, but rather that they will all conclude that divestiture
            provisions are warranted. The problem thus is not one of national uniformity. In the
            absence of a relevant congressional declaration of policy, or a showing of a specific
            discrimination against, or burdening <span class="star-pagination">*129</span> of,
            interstate commerce, we cannot conclude that the States are without power to regulate in
            this area.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>IV</h2>
         <p>Exxon, Phillips, Shell, and Gulf contend that the requirement that voluntary allowances
            be extended to all retail service stations is either in direct conflict with ยง 2 (b) of
            the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, or, more generally, in conflict
            with the basic federal policy in favor of competition, which is reflected in the Sherman
            Act as well as ยง 2 (b). In rejecting these contentions, the Maryland Court of Appeals
            noted that the Maryland statute covered two different competitive situations.<span
               class="sup">[19]</span> In the first situation a competing retailer lowers its price
            on its own, and the oil company gives its own retailer a price reduction to enable it to
            meet that lower price. In the second situation, the competing retailer's lower price is
            subsidized by its supplier, and the oil company gives its own retailer a price reduction
            to meet the competition. The good-faith defense of ยง 2 (b) is clearly not available to
            the oil company in the first situation because the voluntary allowance would not be a
            response to competition from another oil company. See FTC v. Sun Oil Co., 371 U. S. 505.
            In the second situation the law is unsettled,<span class="sup">[20]</span> but the <span
               class="star-pagination">*130</span> Court of Appeals concluded that the defense would
            also be unavailable. The court therefore reasoned that there was no conflict between the
            Maryland statute and ยง 2 (b), since the statute did not apply to any allowance protected
            by federal law. In our opinion, it is not necessary to decide whether the ยง 2 (b)
            defense would apply in the second situation, for even assuming that it does, there is no
            conflict between the Maryland statute and the Robinson-Patman Act sufficient to require
            pre-emption.</p>
         <p>Appellants' first argument is that compliance with the Maryland statute may cause them
            to violate the Robinson-Patman Act. They stress the possibility that the requirement
            that a price reduction be made on a statewide basis may result in discrimination between
            customers who would otherwise receive the same price, and they describe various
            hypothetical situations to illustrate this point.<span class="sup">[21]</span> But,
            "[i]n this as in other areas of coincident federal and state regulation, the `teaching
            of this Court's decisions . . . enjoin[s] seeking out conflicts between state and
            federal regulation where none clearly exists.' Huron Cement Co. v. Detroit, 362 U. S.
            440, 446." Seagram &amp;amp; Sons, Inc. v. Hostetter, 384 U. S. 35, 45. See also State
            v. Texaco, Inc., 14 Wis. 2d 625, 111 N. W. 2d 918 (1961). The Court in Seagram &amp;amp;
            Sons went on to say that "[a]lthough it is possible to envision circumstances under
            which price discriminations <span class="star-pagination">*131</span> proscribed by the
            Robinson-Patman Act might be compelled by [the state statute], the existence of such
            potential conflicts is entirely too speculative in the present posture of this case" to
            warrant pre-emption. 384 U. S., at 46. That counsel of restraint applies with even
            greater force here. For even if we were to delve into the hypothetical situations posed
            by appellants, we would not be presented with a state statute that requires a violation
            of the Robinson-Patman Act. Instead, the alleged "conflict" here is in the possibility
            that the Maryland statute may require uniformity in some situations in which the
            Robinson-Patman Act would permit localized discrimination.<span class="sup">[22]</span>
            This sort of hypothetical conflict is not sufficient to warrant pre-emption.</p>
         <p>Appellants, however, also claim that the Robinson-Patman Act does not simply permit
            localized discrimination, but actually establishes a federal right to engage in
            discriminatory pricing in certain situations. They argue that this federal right may be
            found directly in ยง 2 (b), or, more generally, in our Nation's basic policy favoring
            competition as reflected in the Sherman Act as well as ยง 2 (b). We find neither argument
            persuasive.</p>
         <p>The proviso in ยง 2 (b) of the Clayton Act, as amended by <span class="star-pagination"
               >*132</span> the Robinson-Patman Act, is merely an exception to that statute's broad
            prohibition against discriminatory pricing. It created no new federal right; quite the
            contrary, it defined a specific, limited defense, and even narrowed the good-faith
            defense that had previously existed.<span class="sup">[23]</span> To be sure, the
            defense is an important one, and the interpretation of its contours has been informed by
            the underlying national policy favoring competition which it reflects.<span class="sup"
               >[24]</span> But it is illogical to infer that by excluding certain competitive
            behavior from the general ban against discriminatory pricing, Congress intended to
            pre-empt the States' power to prohibit any conduct within that exclusion. This Court is
            generally reluctant to infer pre-emption, see, e. g., De Canas v. Bica, 424 U. S. 351,
            357-358, n. 5; Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp;amp; Smith v. Ware, 414 U. S. 117,
            127, and it would be particularly inappropriate to do so in this case because the basic
            purposes of the state statute and the Robinson-Patman Act are similar. Both reflect a
            policy choice favoring the interest in equal treatment of all customers <span
               class="star-pagination">*133</span> over the interest in allowing sellers freedom to
            make selective competitive decisions.<span class="sup">[25]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Appellants point out that the Robinson-Patman Act itself may be characterized as an
            exception to, or a qualification of, the more basic national policy favoring free
               competition,<span class="sup">[26]</span> and argue that the Maryland statute
            "undermin[es]" the competitive balance that Congress struck between the Robinson-Patman
            and Sherman Acts.<span class="sup">[27]</span> This is merely another way of stating
            that the Maryland statute will have an anticompetitive effect. In this sense, there is a
            conflict between the statute and the central policy of the Sherman Act&#x97;our "charter
            of economic liberty." Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U. S. 1, 4.
            Nevertheless, this sort of conflict cannot itself constitute a sufficient reason for
            invalidating the Maryland statute. For if an adverse effect on competition were, in and
            of itself, enough to render a state statute invalid, the States' power to engage in
            economic regulation would be effectively destroyed.<span class="sup">[28]</span> We are,
            therefore, satisfied that neither the broad implications of the Sherman Act nor the
            Robinson-Patman Act can fairly <span class="star-pagination">*134</span> be construed as
            a congressional decision to pre-empt the power of the Maryland Legislature to enact this
            law.</p>
         <p>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
         <p>So ordered.</p>

               class="star-pagination">*135</span> policy, I dissent from Part III of the Court's
            opinion because it fails to condemn impermissible discrimination against interstate
            commerce in retail gasoline marketing. The divestiture provisions. Md. Code Ann., Art.
            56, ยงยง 157E (b) and (c) (Supp. 1977) (hereinafter referred to as ยงยง (b) and (c)),
            preclude out-of-state competitors from retailing gasoline within Maryland. The effect is
            to protect in-state retail service station dealers from the competition of the
            out-of-state businesses. This protectionist discrimination is not justified by any
            legitimate state interest that cannot be vindicated by more evenhanded regulation.
            Sections (b) and (c), therefore, violate the Commerce Clause.<span class="sup"
               >[2]</span>
         </p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>In Maryland the retail marketing of gasoline is interstate commerce, for all petroleum
            products come from outside the State. Retailers serve interstate travelers. To the
            extent that particular retailers succeed or fail in their businesses, the interstate
            wholesale market for petroleum products is affected. Cf. Dean Milk Co. v. Madison, 340
            U. S. 349 (1951).<span class="sup">[3]</span> The <span class="star-pagination"
               >*136</span> regulation of retail gasoline sales is therefore within the scope of the
            Commerce Clause. See ibid.; Minnesota v. Barber, 136 U. S. 313 (1890).<span class="sup"
               >[4]</span>
         </p>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>The Commerce Clause forbids discrimination against interstate commerce, which repeatedly
            has been held to mean that States and localities may not discriminate against the
            transactions of out-of-state actors in interstate markets. E. g., Hunt v. Washington
            Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 350-352 (1977); Halliburton Oil Well Co. v.
            Reily, 373 U. S. 64, 69-73 (1963); Dean Milk Co. v. Madison, 340 U. S., at 354; Best
            &amp;amp; Co. v. Maxwell, 311 U. S. 454, 455-456 (1940). The discrimination need not
            appear on the face of the state or local regulation. "The commerce clause forbids
            discrimination, whether forthright or ingenious. In each case it is our duty to
            determine whether the statute under attack, whatever its name may be, will in its
            practical operation work discrimination against interstate commerce." Ibid. (footnote
            omitted). The state or local authority need not intend to discriminate in order to
            offend the policy of maintaining a free-flowing national economy. As demonstrated in
            Hunt, a statute that on its face restricts both intrastate and interstate transactions
            may violate the Clause by having the "practical effect" of discriminating in its
            operation. 432 U. S., at 350-352.</p>
         <p>If discrimination results from a statute, the burden falls upon the state or local
            government to demonstrate legitimate local benefits justifying the inequality and to
            show that less discriminatory alternatives cannot protect the local interests. <span
               class="star-pagination">*137</span> Id., at 353; Dean Milk Co. v. Madison, 340 U. S.,
            at 354. This Court does not merely accept without analysis purported local interests.
            Instead, it independently identifies the character of the interests and judges for
            itself whether alternatives will be adequate. For example, in Dean Milk the city
            attempted to justify a milk pasteurization ordinance by claiming it to be a necessary
            health measure. The city's assertion was not conclusive, however:</p> "A different view,
         that the ordinance is valid simply because it professes to be a health measure, would mean
         that the Commerce Clause of itself imposes no limitations on state action other than those
         laid down by the Due Process Clause, save for the rare instance where a state artlessly
         discloses an avowed purpose to discriminate against interstate goods." Ibid. <p>In an
            independent assessment of the asserted purpose, the Court determined exactly how the
            ordinance protected public health and then concluded that other measures could
            accomplish the same ends. Id., at 354-356. The city's public health purpose therefore
            did not justify the discrimination, and the ordinance violated the Commerce Clause.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B</h2>
         <p>With this background, the unconstitutional discrimination in the Maryland statute
            becomes apparent. No facial inequality exists; ยงยง (b) and (c) preclude all refiners and
            producers from marketing gasoline at the retail level. But given the structure of the
            retail gasoline market in Maryland, the effect of ยงยง (b) and (c) is to exclude a class
            of predominantly out-of-state gasoline retailers while providing protection from
            competition to a class of nonintegrated retailers that is overwhelmingly composed of
            local businessmen. In 1974, of the 3,780 gasoline service stations in the State, 3,547
            were operated by nonintegrated local retail dealers. App. 191, 569, 755. Of the 233
            company-operated stations, 197 belonged to out-of-state <span class="star-pagination"
               >*138</span> integrated producers or refiners. Id., at 190-191. Thirty-four were
            operated by nonintegrated companies that would not have been affected immediately by the
            Maryland statute.<span class="sup">[5]</span>Ibid. The only in-state integrated
            petroleum firm, Crown Central Petroleum, Inc., operated just two service stations. Id.,
            at 189. Of the class of stations statutorily insulated from the competition of the
            out-of-state integrated firms, then, more than 99% were operated by local business
            interests. Of the class of enterprises excluded entirely from participation in the
            retail gasoline market, 95% were out-of-state firms, operating 98% of the stations in
            the class. Ibid.</p>
         <p>The discrimination suffered by the out-of-state integrated producers and refiners is
            significant. Five of the excluded enterprises, Ashland Oil, Inc., BP Oil, Inc., Kayo Oil
            Co., Petroleum Marketing Corp., and Southern States Cooperative, Inc., market nonbranded
            gasoline through price competition rather than through brand recognition. Of the 98
            stations marketing gasoline in this manner, all but 6 are company operated. The company
            operations result from the dominant fact of price competition marketing. According to
            repeated testimony from petroleum economics experts and officers of price
            marketers&#x97;testimony that the trial court did not discredit&#x97;such nonbranded
            stations can compete successfully only if they have day-to-day control of the retail
            price of their products, the hours of operation of their stations, and related business
            details. App. 320, 357, 370-371, 449-451, 503-504, <span class="star-pagination"
               >*139</span> 517, 529-530; Joint App. to Jurisdictional Statements 102a et seq. Only
            with such control can sufficient sales volume be achieved to produce satisfactory
            profits at prices two to three cents a gallon below those of the major branded stations.
            Dealer operation of stations precludes such control because of the illegality of
            vertical price fixing. See, e. g., 15 U. S. C. ยง 1 (1976 ed.); White Motor Co. v. United
            States, 372 U. S. 253 (1963). Therefore, because ยงยง (b) and (c) forbid company
            operations, these out-of-state competitors will have to abandon the Maryland retail
            market altogether. App. 100, 357-358, 455, 519; Joint App. to Jurisdictional Statements
            103a et seq.<span class="sup">[6]</span> For the same reason 32 other out-of-state
            national nonbranded integrated marketers, who operate their own stations without
            dealers, will be precluded from entering the Maryland retail gasoline market.</p>
         <p>The record also contains testimony that the discrimination will burden the operations of
            major branded companies, such as appellants Exxon. Phillips, Shell, and Gulf, all of
            which are out-of-state firms. Most importantly, ยงยง (b) and (c) will preclude these
            companies, as well as those mentioned in the previous paragraph, from competing directly
            for the profits of retail marketing. According to Richard T. Harvin, retail sales
            manager for Exxon's eastern marketing region, Exxon's company-operated stations in
            Maryland annually return 15% of the company's investment&#x97;a profit of $700,000 in
            1974. App. 316. Sections (b) and (c) will force this return to be shared with the local
            dealers. In addition, the ban of the sections will preclude the majors from enhancing
            brand recognition and consumer acceptance through retail outlets with company-controlled
            standards. Id., at 316, 320, 647, 668-669. Their ability directly to monitor consumer
            preferences and <span class="star-pagination">*140</span> reactions will be diminished.
            Id., at 315, 649, 669. And their opportunity for experimentation with retail marketing
            techniques will be curtailed. Id., at 316-317, 647-649, 669. In short, the divestiture
            provisions, which will require the appellant majors to cease operation of property
            valued at more than $10 million, will inflict significant economic hardship on
            Maryland's major brand companies, all of which are out-of-state firms.</p>
         <p>Similar hardship is not imposed upon the local service station dealers by the
            divestiture provisions. Indeed, rather than restricting their ability to compete, the
            Maryland Act effectively and perhaps intentionally improves their competitive position
            by insulating them from competition by out-of-state integrated producers and refiners.
            In its answers to the various complaints in this case, the State repeatedly conceded
            that the Act was intended to protect "the retail dealer as an independent businessman
            [by] reducing the control and dominance of the vertically integrated petroleum producer
            and refiner in the retail market." Id., at 33; see id., at 51, 54, 104, 128, 132, 145,
            147. At trial the State's expert said that the legislation would have the effect of
            protecting the local dealers against the out-of-state competition. Id., at 613. In
            short, the foundation of the discrimination in this case is that the local dealers may
            continue to enter retail transactions and to compete for retail profits while the
            statute will deny similar opportunities to the class composed almost entirely of
            out-of-state businesses.<span class="sup">[7]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*141</span> With discrimination proved against interstate
            commerce, the burden falls upon the State to justify the distinction with legitimate
            state interests that cannot be vindicated with more evenhanded regulation. On the record
            before the Court, the State fails to carry its burden. It asserts only in general terms
            a desire to maintain competition in gasoline retailing. Although this is a laudable
            goal, it cannot be accepted without further analysis, just as the Court could not accept
            the mere assertion of a public health justification in Dean Milk. Here, the State
            ignores the second half of its responsibility; it does not even attempt to demonstrate
            why competition cannot be preserved without banning the out-of-state interests from the
            retail market.</p>
         <p>The State's showing may be so meager because any legitimate interest in competition can
            be vindicated with more evenhanded regulation. First, to the extent that the State's
            interest in competition is nothing more than a desire to protect particular
            competitors&#x97;less efficient local businessmen&#x97;from the legal competition of
            more efficient out-of-state firms, the interest is illegitimate under the Commerce
            Clause. A national economy would hardly flourish if each State could effectively insist
            that local nonintegrated dealers handle product retailing to the exclusion of
            out-of-state integrated firms that would not have sufficient local political clout to
            challenge the influence of local businessmen with their local government leaders.<span
               class="sup">[8]</span> Each State would be encouraged to "legislate according <span
               class="star-pagination">*142</span> to its estimate of its own interests, the
            importance of its own products, and the local advantages or disadvantages of its
            position in a political or commercial view." J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution
            of the United States ยง 259 (4th ed. 1873), quoted in H. P. Hood &amp;amp; Sons v. Du
            Mond, 336 U. S. 525, 533 (1949). See also, e. g., The <ref type="" num="">Federalist</ref>, Nos. 7, 11, 12
            (Hamilton), No. 42 (Madison). The Commerce Clause simply does not countenance such
            parochialism.</p>
         <p>Second, a legitimate concern of the State could be to limit the economic power of
            vertical integration. But nothing in the record suggests that the vertical integration
            that has <span class="star-pagination">*143</span> already occurred in the Maryland
            petroleum market has inhibited competition. Indeed, the trial court found that the
            retail market, dominated by 3,547 dealer outlets constituting more than 90% of the
            State's service stations, is highly competitive.<span class="sup">[9]</span> Therefore,
            the State has shown no need for the divestiture of existing company-owned stations
            required by ยง (c). The legitimacy of any concern about future integration, which could
            support the discrimination of ยง (b), is suspect because of the exemption granted
            wholesalers, which, not surprisingly, are local businesses able to influence the state
               legislature.<span class="sup">[10]</span> See n. 7, supra.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*144</span> Third, the State appears to be concerned about
            unfair competitive behavior such as predatory pricing or inequitable allocation of
            petroleum products by the integrated firms. These are the only examples of specific
            misconduct asserted in the State's answers. App. 33-34, 54-55, 81-83, 109-111, 133-134,
            148-149. But none of the concerns support the discrimination in ยงยง (b) and (c). There is
            no proof in the record that any significant portion of the class of out-of-state firms
            burdened by the divestiture sections has engaged in such misconduct. Furthermore,
            predatory pricing and unfair allocation already have been prohibited by both state and
            federal law. See, e. g., Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, 87 Stat. 628, 15 U.
            S. C. ยง 751 et seq. (1976 ed.); Energy Policy and Conservation Act, ยง 461, 89 Stat. 955,
            15 U. S. C. ยง 760g (1976 ed.); Maryland Motor Fuel Inspection Law, Md. Code Ann., Art.
            56, ยง 157E (f) (Supp. 1977); Maryland Antitrust Act, Md. Com. Law Code Ann. ยง 11-201 et
            seq. (1975); Maryland Unfair Sales Act, Md. Com. Law Code Ann. ยง 11-401 et seq. (1975).
            Less discriminatory legislation, which would regulate the leasing of all service
            stations, not just those owned by the out-of-state integrated producers and refiners,
            could prevent whatever evils arise from short-term <span class="star-pagination"
               >*145</span> leases. Cf. Maryland Gasoline Products Marketing Act, Md. Com. Law Code
            Ann. ยง 11-304 (g) (Supp. 1977).<span class="sup">[11]</span>
         </p>
         <p>In sum, the State has asserted before this Court only a vague interest in preserving
            competition in its retail gasoline market. It has not shown why its interest cannot be
            vindicated by legislation less discriminatory toward out-of-state retailers. It
            therefore has not met its burden to justify the discrimination inherent in ยงยง (b) and
            (c), and they violate the Commerce Clause.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>The arguments of the Court's opinion, the Maryland Court of Appeals decision,<span
               class="sup">[12]</span> and appellees do not remove the unconstitutional taint from
            the discrimination inherent in ยงยง (b) and (c).</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>The Court offers essentially three responses to the discrimination in the retail
            gasoline market imposed by the divestiture provisions.<span class="sup">[13]</span>
            First, the Court says that the discrimination <span class="star-pagination">*146</span>
            against the class of out-of-state producers and refiners does not violate the Commerce
            Clause because the State has not imposed similar discrimination against other
            out-of-state retailers. Ante, at 125-126. This is said to distinguish the present case
            from Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm'n. In fact, however, the unconstitutional
            discrimination in Hunt was not against all out-of-state interests. North Carolina had
            enacted a statute requiring that apples marketed in closed containers within the State
            bear "`no grade other than the applicable U. S. grade or standard.'" 432 U. S., at 335.
            The Commission contended that the provision discriminated against interstate commerce
            because it prohibited the display of superior Washington State apple grading marks. The
            Court did not strike down the provision because it discriminated against the marketing
            techniques of all out-of-state growers. The provision imposed no discrimination on
            growers from States that employed only the United States Department of Agriculture
            grading system.<span class="sup">[14]</span> Despite this <span class="star-pagination"
               >*147</span> lack of universal discrimination, the Court declared the provision
            unconstitutional because it discriminated against a single segment of out-of-state
            marketers of apples, namely, the Washington State growers who employed the superior
            grading system. In this regard, the Maryland divestiture provisions are identical to,
            not distinguishable from, the North Carolina statute in Hunt. Here, the discrimination
            has been imposed against a segment of the out-of-state retailers of gasoline, namely,
            those who also refine or produce petroleum.</p>
         <p>To accept the argument of the Court, that is, that discrimination must be universal to
            offend the Commerce Clause, naively will foster protectionist discrimination against
            interstate commerce. In the future, States will be able to insulate in-state interests
            from competition by identifying the most potent segments of out-of-state business,
            banning them, and permitting less effective out-of-state actors to remain. The record
            shows that the Court permits Maryland to effect just such discrimination in this case.
            The State bans the most powerful out-of-state firms from retailing gasoline within its
            boundaries. It then insulates the forced divestiture of 199 service stations from
            constitutional attack by permitting out-of-state firms such as Pantry Pride, Fisca,
            Hi-Way, and Midway to continue to operate 34 gasoline stations. Effective out-of-state
            competition is thereby emasculated&#x97;no doubt, an ingenious discrimination. But as
            stated at the outset, "the commerce clause forbids discrimination, whether forthright or
            ingenious." Best &amp;amp; Co. v. Maxwell, 311 U. S., at 455.</p>
         <p>Second, the Court contends, as a subpart of its primary argument, that the
            discrimination in Hunt "raised the cost of doing business for out-of-state dealers, and,
            in various other ways, favored the in-state dealers in the local market. 432 U. S., at
            351-352. No comparable claim can be made here." Ante, at 126. Once it is seen that the
            discrimination in Hunt raised the cost of doing business for only one group of the
            out-of-state marketers of apples, the fallacy of the Court's <span
               class="star-pagination">*148</span> argument appears. In fact, here the burden
            imposed upon the class of out-of-state retailers subject to the discrimination of ยงยง (b)
            and (c) far exceeds the burdens in Hunt. In Hunt the statute merely increased costs and
            deprived the Washington growers of the competitive advantages of the use of their
            grading system. Here, the statute bans the refiners and producers from the retail market
            altogether&#x97;a burden that lacks comparability with the effects in Hunt only because
            it is more severe.</p>
         <p>Third, the Court asserts without citation: "The fact that the burden of a state
            regulation falls on some interstate companies does not, by itself, establish a claim of
            discrimination against interstate commerce." Ante, at 126. This proposition is correct
            only to the extent that it is incomplete; it does not apply to the facts present here.
            It is true that merely demonstrating a burden on some out-of-state actors does not prove
            unconstitutional discrimination. But when the burden is significant, when it falls on
            the most numerous and effective group of out-of-state competitors, when a similar burden
            does not fall on the class of protected in-state businessmen, and when the State cannot
            justify the resulting disparity by showing that its legislative interests cannot be
            vindicated by more evenhanded regulation, unconstitutional discrimination exists. The
            facts of this litigation demonstrate such discrimination, and the Court does not argue
            persuasively to the contrary.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B</h2>
         <p>The contentions of the Maryland Court of Appeals, which also found no violation of the
            Commerce Clause, are no more convincing than the arguments of the Court's opinion.
            First, the Court of Appeals reasoned that ยงยง (b) and (c) did not discriminate against
            the class of out-of-state refiners and producers because the wholesale flow of petroleum
            products into the State was not restricted. 279 Md. 410, 431, 370 A. 2d 1102, 1114
            (1977). This supposedly distinguished the present <span class="star-pagination"
               >*149</span> facts from those of Dean Milk Co. v. Madison, which involved
            unconstitutional discrimination against interstate commerce. To begin with, however, the
            distinction drawn by the Court of Appeals is basically irrelevant. The Maryland statute
            has not effected discrimination with regard to the wholesaling or interstate transport
            of petroleum. The discrimination exists with regard to retailing. The fact that gasoline
            will continue to flow into the State does not permit the State to deny out-of-state
            firms the opportunity to retail it once it arrives.</p>
         <p>Furthermore, Dean Milk cannot be distinguished on the ground asserted by the Court of
            Appeals. There, this Court invalidated ยง 7.21 of the General Ordinances of the city of
            Madison (1949), which outlawed the local sale of milk not pasteurized within five miles
            of the city. The section did not legally or effectively block the flow of out-of-state
            milk into Madison to any greater extent than the restrictions on sales of gasoline by
            out-of-state companies block the flow of gasoline here. In Dean Milk out-of-state
            producers could bring their milk to Madison, have it pasteurized in Madison, and sell it
            in Madison without violating ยง 7.21. If the flow of milk were at all restricted, it was
            merely because the out-of-state producers chose not to deal with the Madison
            pasteurizers. Similarly, the flow of gasoline into Maryland may be restricted if the
            out-of-state producers and refiners choose not to supply the dealers who replace the
            company-owned operations.<span class="sup">[15]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Second, the Court of Appeals said the Maryland legislation did not offend the Commerce
            Clause because the legislature intended to preserve competition, not to discriminate
            against interstate commerce. 279 Md., at 431, 370 A. 2d, at 1114. <span
               class="star-pagination">*150</span> With this argument, the court fell into the same
            trap that confines the State's proffered justifications for the discrimination of ยงยง (b)
            and (c). To begin with, the fact that no discrimination was intended is irrelevant
            where, as here, discriminatory effects result from the statutory scheme. Furthermore,
            the fact that the legislature might have had a laudable intent when it passed the law
            cannot by itself justify the divestiture provisions. The State must also show that its
            interests cannot be vindicated by less discriminatory alternatives. The Court of Appeals
            erroneously failed to require such a showing from the appellees.</p>
         <p>Third, the Court of Appeals resurrected the outdated notion that retailing is merely
            local activity not subject to the strictures of the Commerce Clause. 279 Md., at 432,
            370 A. 2d, at 1114-1115, citing Crescent Oil Co. v. Mississippi, 257 U. S. 129 (1921).
            In Crescent Oil the Court said that the operation of cotton gins was local manufacturing
            rather than interstate commerce. As explained at the beginning of Part I of this
            opinion, however, the interstate character of the retail gasoline market and 57 years of
            intervening constitutional and economic development prevent the application of Crescent
            Oil to the facts of this litigation. See nn. 3 and 4, and accompanying text, supra.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>C</h2>
         <p>Finally, nothing in the argument of the appellees saves the distinctions in ยงยง (b) and
            (c) from the taint of unconstitutionality. First, the State argues that discrimination
            against interstate commerce has not occurred because "[n]o nexus between interstate as
            opposed to local interests inheres in the production or refining of petroleum." Brief
            for Appellees 23. Although this statement might be correct in the abstract, it is
            incorrect in reality, given the structure of the Maryland petroleum market. Due to
            geological formation as so far known, no petroleum is produced in Maryland; due to the
            economics of production and refining, as well as to the geology, <span
               class="star-pagination">*151</span> no petroleum is refined in Maryland. As a matter
            of actual fact, then, an inherent nexus does exist between the out-of-state status of
            producers and refiners and the distribution and retailing of gasoline in Maryland. The
            Commerce Clause does not forbid only legislation that discriminates under all factual
            circumstances. It forbids discrimination in effect against interstate commerce on the
            specific facts of each case. If production or refining of gasoline occurred in Maryland,
            ยงยง (b) and (c) might not be unconstitutional. Under those different circumstances,
            however, the producers and refiners would have a fair opportunity to influence their
            local legislators and thereby to prevent the enactment of economically disruptive
            legislation. Under those circumstances, the economic disruption would be felt directly
            in Maryland, which would tend to make the local political processes responsive to the
            problems thereby created. Under those circumstances, ยงยง (b) and (c) might never have
            been passed. In this case, however, the economic disruption of the sections is visited
            upon out-of-state economic interests and not upon in-state businesses. One of the basic
            assumptions of the Commerce Clause is that local political systems will tend to be
            unresponsive to problems not felt by local constituents; instead, local political units
            are expected to act in their constituents' interests.<span class="sup">[16]</span> One
            of the basic purposes of the Clause, therefore, is to prevent the vindication of such
            self-interest from unfairly burdening out-of-state concerns and thereby disrupting the
            national economy.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*152</span> Second, appellees argue, as did the Court of
            Appeals, that ยงยง (b) and (c) do not discriminate impermissibly because the Maryland
            Legislature passed them with the intent to preserve competition. As explained above,
            however, the mere assertion of a laudable purpose does not carry the State's burden to
            justify the discriminatory effects of the statute. See Parts I-B and II-B, supra.</p>
         <p>Third, appellees rely upon the Court of Appeals' contention that unconstitutional
            discrimination against interstate commerce can be found only where the flow of
            interstate goods is curtailed. Appellees' assertion fares no better than did the court's
            because the appellees fail to show how the effect on the flow of interstate goods varies
            in kind between this case and Dean Milk. See Part II-B, supra.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>The Court's decision brings to mind the well-known words of Mr. Justice Cardozo:</p> "To
         give entrance to [protectionism] would be to invite a speedy end of our national
         solidarity. The Constitution was framed under the dominion of a political philosophy less
         parochial in range. It was framed upon the theory that the peoples of the several states
         must sink or swim together, and that in the long run prosperity and salvation are in union
         and not division." Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S. 511, 523 (1935). <p>Today,
            the Court fails to heed the Justice's admonition. The parochial political philosophy of
            the Maryland Legislature thereby prevails. I would reverse the judgment of the Maryland
            Court of Appeals.</p>

            affirmatively shown, the Commission is authorized to issue an order terminating the
            discrimination: Provided, however, That nothing herein contained shall prevent a seller
            rebutting the prima-facie case thus made by showing that his lower price or the
            furnishing of services or facilities to any purchaser or purchasers was made in good
            faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor, or the services or facilities
            furnished by a competitor." 15 U. S. C. ยง 13 (b) (1976 ed.).</p>
         <p>[3] As used by the Court of Appeals and in this opinion, "company-operated station"
            refers to a retail service station operated directly by employees of a refiner or
            producer of petroleum products (or a subsidiary). 279 Md., at 419 n. 2,370 A. 2d, at
            1108 n. 2.</p>
         <p>[4] For instance, Exxon has used its company-operated stations to introduce such
            marketing ideas as partial self-service, in-bay car-wash units, and motor-oil vending
            machines. App. 205-209.</p>
         <p>[5] Exxon presented nine arguments, both constitutional and statutory. It contended that
            the statute was arbitrary and irrational under the Due Process Clause; constituted an
            unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation; denied it, in two
            distinct ways, the equal protection of the laws; constituted an unlawful delegation of
            legislative authority; was unconstitutionally vague; discriminated against and burdened
            interstate commerce; and was pre-empted by the Robinson-Patman Act and the Federal
            Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973. Id., at 14-16.</p>
         <p>[6] These plaintiffs are Continental Oil Co. (and its subsidiary Kayo Oil Co.),
            Commonwealth Oil Refining Co. (and its subsidiary Petroleum Marketing Corp.), and
            Ashland Oil Co.</p>
         <p>[7] These plaintiffs are Phillips Petroleum Co., Shell Oil Co., and Gulf Oil Corp.</p>
         <p>[8] See 279 Md., at 445-446, 370 A. 2d, at 1121-1122.</p>
         <p>[9] Id., at 418-420, 370 A. 2d, at 1107-1108.</p>
         <p>[10] The Court of Appeals stated that the statute "would not in any way restrict the
            free flow of petroleum products into or out of the state." Id., at 431, 370 A. 2d, at
            1114. While the evidence in the record does not directly support this assertion, it is
            certainly a permissible inference to be drawn from the evidence, or lack thereof,
            presented by the appellants. See Reply Brief for Appellants in No. 77-64, p. 7.</p>
         <p>[11] See n. 5, supra.</p>
         <p>[12] Indeed, although the Circuit Court's decision rested primarily on the substantive
            due process claim, only appellants Continental Oil and its subsidiary, Kayo Oil, press
            that claim here.</p>
         <p>[13] It is worth noting that divestiture is by no means a novel method of economic
            regulation, and is found in both federal and state statutes. To date, the courts have
            had little difficulty sustaining such statutes against a substantive due process attack.
            See, e. g., Paramount Pictures, Inc. v. Langer, 23 F. Supp. 890 (ND 1938), dismissed as
            moot, 306 U. S. 619; see generally Comment, Gasoline Marketing Practices and "Meeting
            Competition" under the Robinson-Patman Act, 37 Md. L. Rev. 323, 329 n. 44 (1977).</p>
         <p>[14] Brief for Appellants in No. 77-10, p. 27.</p>
         <p>[15] For instance, as of July 1, 1974, such interstate, nonrefining or non-producing,
            companies as Sears, Roebuck &amp;amp; Co., Hudson Oil Co., and Pantry Pride operated
            retail gas stations in Maryland. App. 190-191. Hudson has, however, recently acquired a
            refinery. See Brief for Appellants in No. 77-10, p. 33 n. 17.</p>
         <p>[16] If the effect of a state regulation is to cause local goods to constitute a larger
            share, and goods with an out-of-state source to constitute a smaller share, of the total
            sales in the market&#x97;as in Hunt, 432 U. S., at 347, and Dean Milk, 340 U. S., at
            354&#x97;the regulation may have a discriminatory effect on interstate commerce. But the
            Maryland statute has no impact on the relative proportions of local and out-of-state
            goods sold in Maryland and, indeed, no demonstrable effect whatsoever on the interstate
            flow of goods. The sales by independent retailers are just as much a part of the flow of
            interstate commerce as the sales made by the refiner-operated stations.</p>
         <p>[17] Reply Brief for Appellants in No. 77-64, p. 7.</p>
         <p>[18] California, Delaware, the District of Columbia, and Florida have adopted laws
            restricting refiners' operation of service stations. Similar proposals have been before
            the legislatures of 32 other jurisdictions. See Brief for Appellants in No. 77-10, p. 45
            nn. 21 and 22; Brief for the State of California as Amicus Curiae.</p>
         <p>[19] The Court of Appeals also noted that there is a third competitive situation&#x97;a
            discriminatory price reduction made to meet an equally low price offered to the same
            buyer by a competing seller. In the lower court's view, this situation clearly fell
            within the ยง 2 (b) defense, but was not encompassed by the term "voluntary allowances."
            279 Md., at 452, 370 A. 2d, at 1125.</p>
         <p>[20] The Court left the question open in Sun Oil, 371 U. S., at 512 n. 7, and the lower
            courts have reached conflicting results. Compare Enterprise Industries v. Texas Co., 136
            F. Supp. 420 (Conn. 1955), rev'd on other grounds, 240 F. 2d 457 (CA2 1957), cert.
            denied, 353 U. S. 965, with Bargain Car Wash, Inc. v. Standard Oil Co. (Indiana), 466 F.
            2d 1163 (CA7 1972).</p>
         <p>[21] Appellants argue that compliance with the "voluntary allowance" provision may
            expose them to both primary-line and secondary-line liability under ยง 2 (a) of the
            Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act. With respect to primary-line
            liability, they pose the hypothesis of a seller who responds to a competitor's lower
            price in Baltimore. Under the statute, he must lower his prices throughout the State,
            even though the competitive market justifying that price is confined to Baltimore.
            Appellants then argue that a competitor operating only in Salisbury, Md., may be injured
            by this price reduction. But an injury flowing from a uniform price reduction is not
            actionable under the Robinson-Patman Act, which only prohibits price discrimination. See
            F. Rowe, Price Discrimination Under the Robinson-Patman Act 93 (1962).</p>
         <p>[22] Thus, appellants' claim that the statute will create secondary-line liability is
            premised on the possibility that price differentials may arise between stations located
            in Maryland and those in neighboring States. With respect to this claim, it is
            sufficient to note that, although the Maryland statute may affect the business decision
            of whether or not to reduce prices, it does not create any irreconcilable conflict with
            the Robinson-Patman Act. The statute may require that a voluntary allowance that could
            legally have been confined to the Baltimore area be extended to Salisbury. We may then
            assume, arguendo, that the Robinson-Patman Act could require a further extension of the
            allowance into the neighboring State. The possible scope of the voluntary allowance may,
            therefore, have an impact on the company's decision on whether or not to meet the
            competition in Baltimore, but the state statute does not in any way require
            discriminatory prices. See also n. 20, supra.</p>
         <p>[23] Section 2 of the original Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730, established an absolute
            defense for a seller's reductions in price made "in good faith to meet competition . . .
            ." The legislative history of the Robinson-Patman Act shows that ยง 2 (b) was intended to
            limit that broad defense. See Standard Oil Co. v. FTC, 340 U. S. 231, 247-249, n.
            14.</p>
         <p>[24] In holding that ยง 2 (b) created a substantive, rather than merely a procedural,
            defense, the Court explained: </p>
         <p>"The heart of our national economic policy long has been faith in the value of
            competition. In the Sherman and Clayton Acts, as well as in the Robinson-Patman Act,
            `Congress was dealing with competition, which it sought to protect, and monopoly, which
            it sought to prevent.' Staley Mfg. Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 135 F. 2d 453, 455. We
            need not now reconcile, in its entirety, the economic theory which underlies the
            Robinson-Patman Act with that of the Sherman and Clayton Acts. It is enough to say that
            Congress did not seek by the Robinson-Patman Act either to abolish competition or so
            radically to curtail it that a seller would have no substantial right of self-defense
            against a price raid by a competitor." Standard Oil Co., supra, at 248-249 (footnote
            omitted).</p>
         <p>[25] Just as the political and economic stimulus for the Robinson-Patman Act was the
            perceived need to protect independent retail stores from "chain stores," see U. S.
            Department of Justice, Report on the Robinson-Patman Act 114-124 (1977), so too the
            Maryland statute was prompted by the perceived need to protect independent retail
            service station dealers from the vertically integrated oil companies. 279 Md., at 422,
            370 A. 2d, at 1109.</p>
         <p>[26] Indeed, many have argued that the Robinson-Patman Act is fundamentally
            anticompetitive and undermines the purposes of the Sherman Act. See generally U. S.
            Department of Justice Report, supra.</p>
         <p>[27] Brief for Appellants in No. 77-10, p. 80.</p>
         <p>[28] Appellants argue that Maryland has actually regulated beyond its boundaries,
            pointing to the possibility that they may have to extend voluntary allowances into
            neighboring States in order to avoid liability under the Robinson-Patman Act. See nn. 21
            and 22, supra. But this alleged extra-territorial effect arises from the Robinson-Patman
            Act, not the Maryland statute.</p>
         <p>[1] The presently challenged portions of the law were enacted four years ago and amended
            once since then. 1974 Md. Laws, ch. 854; 1975 Md. Laws, ch. 608. The statute is now
            codified as Md. Code Ann., Art. 56, ยง 157E (Supp. 1977), and reads: </p>
         <p>"(a) For the purpose of this law all gasoline and special fuels sold or offered or
            exposed for sale shall be subject to inspection and analysis as hereinafter provided. .
            . .</p>
         <p>"(b) After July 1, 1974, no producer or refiner of petroleum products shall open a major
            brand, secondary brand or unbranded retail service station in the State of Maryland, and
            operate it with company personnel, a subsidiary company, commissioned agent, or under a
            contract with any person, firm, or corporation, managing a service station on a fee
            arrangement with the producer or refiner. The station must be operated by a retail
            service station dealer.</p>
         <p>"(c) After July 1, 1975, no producer or refiner of petroleum products shall operate a
            major brand, secondary brand, or unbranded retail service station in the State of
            Maryland, with company personnel, a subsidiary company, commissioned agent, or under a
            contract with any person, firm, or corporation managing a service station on a fee
            arrangement with the producer or refiner. The station must be operated by a retail
            service station dealer.</p>
         <p>"(d) Every producer, refiner, or wholesaler of petroleum products supplying gasoline and
            special fuels to retail service station dealers shall extend all voluntary allowances
            uniformly to all retail service station dealers supplied.</p>
         <p>"(e) Every producer, refiner, or wholesaler of petroleum products supplying gasoline and
            special fuels to retail service station dealers shall apply all equipment rentals
            uniformly to all retail service station dealers supplied.</p>
         <p>"(f) Every producer, refiner or wholesaler of petroleum products shall apportion
            uniformly all gasoline and special fuels to all retail service station dealers during
            periods of shortages on an equitable basis, and shall not discriminate among the dealers
            in their allotments."</p>
         <p>[2] U. S. Const., Art. I, ยง 8, cl. 3: </p>
         <p>"The Congress shall have Power . . .</p>
         <p>"To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the
            Indian Tribes."</p>
         <p>[3] The inherent effect of local regulation of retail sales on interstate commerce is
            well illustrated by Dean Milk. The city of Madison forbade the sale of pasteurized milk
            unless pasteurization occurred at a plant located within five miles of the center of the
            city. General Ordinances of the City of Madison ยง 7.21 (1949). Even though only local
            sale was prohibited, the Court considered the ordinance to be a regulation of interstate
            commerce.</p>
         <p>[4] Cf. Best &amp;amp; Co. v. Maxwell, 311 U. S. 454 (1940) (holding that taxation of
            local retailing was within the reach of the Commerce Clause); United States v. Frankfort
            Distilleries, Inc., 324 U. S. 293 (1945) (holding that retailing was interstate commerce
            within the scope of the Sherman Act). See generally Note, Gasoline Marketing Divestiture
            Statutes: A Preliminary Constitutional and Economic Assessment, 28 Vand. L. Rev. 1277,
            1303 (1975).</p>
         <p>[5] In 1974 Fisca Oil Co., Giant Food, Inc., Hi-Way Oil, Inc., Homes Oil Co., Hudson Oil
            Co., Midway Petroleum, National Oil Co., Pantry Pride, Savon Gas Stations, and Sears,
            Roebuck &amp;amp; Co. operated gasoline stations in Maryland. Because none of these
            organizations produced or refined petroleum at that time, the statute would not have
            restricted their operations. It should be noted, however, that the statute will reach
            any of these firms deciding to integrate backwards from retailing to refining or
            producing. After this suit was filed, Hudson Oil Co. acquired a refinery and thus became
            another out-of-state business subject to the ban of ยงยง (b) and (c). App. 518-519.</p>
         <p>[6] The sections will force Ashland to divest 17 stations in which it has invested
            $2,381,385. Id., at 257, 258-259. Petroleum Marketing has 21 stations valued at
            $2,043,710. Id., at 656.</p>
         <p>[7] Another indication of the discrimination against out-of-state business was the
            amendment of the original legislative proposal to exempt wholesalers of gasoline from
            the divestiture requirements. The author of the proposal intended to ban retailing by
            wholesalers and "not to discriminate against one class as to another." Id., at 568. On
            cross-examination he was asked why the exemption was enacted. He replied: </p>
         <p>"It was up to the General Assembly to make that decision. Apparently the wholesalers
            were represented at the testimony in the hearings. . . . I did hear at a later date that
            they wanted to be exempt from it because some of the wholesalers being local jobbers had
            no investment or financial activity or engagement with the producer-refiner so they
            wanted to plea upon the mercy of the committee so to speak . . . .</p>
         <p>.....</p>
         <p>"Q. You have no information then as to why the Legislature of Maryland chose to make
            that discrimination? A. Not other than hearsay as to the general data that these men
            were local businessmen, had no definite tie in with the refinery . . . ." Id., at
            568-569.</p>
         <p>[8] There is support in the record for the inference that the Maryland Legislature
            passed the divestiture provisions in response to the pleas of local gasoline dealers for
            protection against the competition of both the price marketers and the major oil
            companies. For example, the executive director of the Greater Washington/Maryland
            Service Station Association, which represents almost 700 local Maryland dealers,
            testified before the Economic Matters Committee of the Maryland Senate: </p>
         <p>"I would like to begin by telling you gentlemen that these are desperate days for
            service station dealers. . . .</p>
         <p>.....</p>
         <p>"Now beset by the critical gasoline supply situation, the squeeze by his
            landlord-supplier and the shrinking service and tire, battery and accessory market, the
            dealer is now faced with an even more serious problem.</p>
         <p>"That is the sinister threat of the major oil companies to complete their takeover of
            the retail-marketing of gasoline, not just to be in competition with their own branded
            dealers, but to squeeze them out and convert their stations to company operation.</p>
         <p>.....</p>
         <p>"Our oil industry has grown beyond the borders of our country to where its American
            character has been replaced by a multinational one.</p>
         <p>"Are the legislators of Maryland now about to let this octopus loose and unrestricted in
            the state of Maryland, among our small businessmen to devour them? We sincerely hope
            not.</p>
         <p>"The men that you see here today are the back-bone of American small business. . . .</p>
         <p>"We are here today asking you, our own legislators to protect us from an economic giant
            who would take away our very livelihood and our children's future in its greed for
            greater profits. Please give us the protection we need to save our stations." Id., at
            755, 756, 761.</p>
         <p>[9] From the facts stipulated by the parties, the trial court found: </p>
         <p>"Retail petroleum marketing in the State of Maryland is and has been a highly
            competitive industry. This is a result of the number and location of available
            facilities, the comparatively small capital costs for entering the business, the
            mobility of the purchaser at the time of purchasing the products, the relative
            interchangeability of one competitor's products with another in the mind of the
            consumer, the visibility of price information, and the many choices the consumer has in
            terms of prices, brands, and services offered." Joint App. to Jurisdictional Statements
            99a.</p>
         <p>The continuing competitive nature of the Maryland gasoline market provided one basis for
            the trial court's holding that the State had not "demonstrated a real and substantial
            relation to the object sought to be attained by the means selected[;] the evidence
            presented before it indicates that the statute is inversely related to the public
            welfare." Id., at 131a-132a. The trial court therefore considered the statute
            unconstitutional.</p>
         <p>[10] The trial court entered several findings about the integration of the oil companies
            and the need for divestiture: </p>
         <p>"Apart from restraining free competition, it was shown that divestiture would be harmful
            to competition in the industry, and would primarily serve to protect the independent
            dealers rather than the public at large. There was no proven detrimental effect upon the
            retail market caused by company-owned-and-operated stations which could not be curbed by
            federal and state anti-trust laws.</p>
         <p>.....</p>
         <p>"The court also finds from the preponderance of the evidence that the law will preclude
            all of some thirty-two producer-refiners not now in the State from ever entering the
            competitive market in Maryland, and vertical integration will be prohibited. Neither
            effect is in the public interest since competition is essentially for consumer
            benefit.</p>
         <p>"Noteworthy also is the fact that the original draft of the law included wholesalers in
            the prohibition against retail selling. The final draft of the law eliminated
            wholesalers, for the sole reason, according to Mr. Coleman, that the wholesalers
            requested their elimination from the act. There is no evidence whatsoever relative to
            why wholesalers should have been included initially, nor how the general public
            benefited from their exemption.</p>
         <p>"In all the more than one hundred eighty-five pounds of pleadings, motions, briefs,
            exhibits and depositions before this court, there is no concrete evidence that the act
            was justified as to the classes of operators singled out to be affected in order to
            promote the general welfare of the citizens of the State. Rather, it is apparent that
            the entire bill is designed to benefit one class of merchants to the detriment of
            another." Id., at 130a-131a (emphasis supplied).</p>
         <p>[11] This statute states: </p>
         <p>"(g) Distributor may not unreasonably withhold certain consents . . . The distributor
            may not unreasonably withhold his consent to any assignment, transfer, sale, or renewal
            of a marketing agreement. . . ."</p>
         <p>[12] 279 Md. 410, 370 A. 2d 1102 and 372 A. 2d 237 (1977). The trial court, the Circuit
            Court for Anne Arundel County, Md., did not address the question whether ยงยง (b) and (c)
            unconstitutionally discriminated against interstate commerce. It held that the statute
            offended substantive due process, in violation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights,
            Art.23.</p>
         <p>[13] The Court also notes that ยงยง (b) and (c) do not discriminate against interstate
            goods and do not favor local producers and refiners. While true, the observation is
            irrelevant because it does not address the discrimination inflicted upon retail
            marketing in the State. Cf. Part II-B, infra. </p>
         <p>Footnote 16 of the Court's opinion, ante, at 126-127, suggests that unconstitutional
            discrimination does not exist unless there is an effect on the quantity of out-of-state
            goods entering a State. This is too narrow a view of the Commerce Clause. First,
            interstate commerce consists of far more than mere production of goods. It also consists
            of transactions&#x97;of repeated buying and selling of both goods and services. By
            focusing exclusively on the quantity of goods, the Court limits the protection of the
            Clause to producers and handlers of goods before they enter a discriminating State. In
            our complex national economy, commercial transactions continue after the goods enter a
            State. The Court today permits a State to impose protectionist discrimination upon these
            later transactions to the detriment of out-of-state participants. Second, the Court
            cites no case in which this Court has held that a burden on the flow of goods is a
            prerequisite to establishing a case of unconstitutional discrimination against
            interstate commerce. Neither Hunt nor Dean Milk contains such a holding. In both of
            those cases the Court upheld the claims of discrimination; in neither did it say that a
            burden on the wholesale flow of goods was a necessary part of its holding. Regarding
            Hunt, the Court cites to 432 U. S., at 347, which discusses only whether the appellants
            had met the $10,000 amount-in-controversy requirement of 28 U. S. C. ยง 1331. As
            explained in Part II-B, infra, this case presents a threat to the flow of gasoline in
            Maryland identical to the threat to the flow of milk in Dean Milk.</p>
         <p>[14] Growers from 13 States marketed apples in North Carolina. Six of the States did not
            have state grading systems apart from the USDA regulations. 432 U. S., at 349.</p>
         <p>[15] In fact, the disruption of the flow of gasoline in this case could be greater than
            the disruption of the flow of milk in Madison. The record supports the proposition that
            the ban on company operations may so unsettle the wholesale and refining enterprises of
            the independent price marketers that they will not be able profitably to supply gasoline
            to the stations of nonintegrated retailers in Maryland. App. 504-505, 509, 531.</p>
         <p>[16] Given the Nation's experience under the Articles of Confederation, the assumption
            is not an unreasonable one. At that time authority to regulate commerce rested with the
            States rather than with Congress. The pursuit by each State of the particular interests
            of its economy and constituents nearly wrecked the national economy. "The almost
            catastrophic results from this sort of situation were harmful commercial wars and
            reprisals at home among the States . . . ." P. Hartman, State Taxation of Interstate
            Commerce 2 (1953), citing, e. g., The <ref type="" num="">Federalist</ref>, Nos. 7, 11, 22 (Hamilton), No. 42
            (Madison).</p>
