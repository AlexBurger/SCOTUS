         SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA. <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*25</span> Thomas C. MacDonald, Jr., by appointment of the
            Court, 446 U. S. 916, argued the cause and filed briefs for petitioner.</p>
         <p>Wallace E. Allbritton, Assistant Attorney General of Florida, argued the cause for
            respondent. With him on the brief was Jim Smith, Attorney General.</p>
         <p>JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
         <p>Florida, like many other States, rewards each convicted prisoner for good conduct and
            obedience to prison rules by using a statutory formula that reduces the portion of his
            sentence that he must serve. In this case, we consider whether a Florida statute
            altering the availability of such "gain time for good conduct"<span class="sup"
               >[1]</span> is unconstitutional as an ex post facto law when applied to petitioner,
            whose crime was committed before the statute's enactment.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>The relevant facts are undisputed. Petitioner pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.
            The crime charged occurred on January 31, 1976. On May 13, 1976, petitioner was
            convicted and sentenced to a prison term of 15 years, less time <span
               class="star-pagination">*26</span> already served. The state statute in place on both
            the date of the offense and the date of sentencing provided a formula for deducting
            gain-time credits from the sentences "of every prisoner who has committed no infraction
            of the rules or regulations of the division, or of the laws of the state, and who has
            performed in a faithful, diligent, industrious, orderly and peaceful manner, the work,
            duties and tasks assigned to him." Fla. Stat. § 944.27 (1) (1975).<span class="sup"
               >[2]</span> According to the formula, gain-time credits were to be calculated by the
            month and were to accumulate at an increasing rate the more time the prisoner had
            already served. Thus, the statute directed that the authorities "shall grant the
            following deductions" from a prisoner's sentence as gain time for good conduct:</p> "(a)
         Five days per month off the first and second years of his sentence; "(b) Ten days per month
         off the third and fourth years of his sentence; and "(c) Fifteen days per month off the
         fifth and all succeeding years of his sentence." Fla. Stat. § 944.27 (1) (1975). <p>In
            1978, the Florida Legislature repealed § 944.27 (1) and enacted a new formula for
            monthly gain-time deductions. This new statute provided:</p> "(a) Three days per month
         off the first and second years of the sentence; "(b) Six days per month off the third and
         fourth years of the sentence; and "(c) Nine days per month off the fifth and all succeeding
         years of the sentence." Fla. Stat. § 944.275 (1) (1979).<span class="sup">[3]</span>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*27</span> The new provision was implemented on January 1,
            1979, and since that time the State has applied it not only to prisoners sentenced for
            crimes committed since its enactment in 1978, but also to all other prisoners, including
            petitioner, whose offenses took place before that date.<span class="sup">[4]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Petitioner, acting pro se, sought a writ of habeas corpus from the Supreme Court of
            Florida on the ground that the new statute as applied to him was an ex post facto law
            prohibited by the United States and the Florida Constitutions.<span class="sup"
               >[5]</span> He alleged that the reduced accumulation of monthly gain-time credits
            provided under the new statute would extend his required time in prison by over 2 years,
            or approximately 14 percent of his original 15-year sentence.<span class="sup"
               >[6]</span> The State Supreme <span class="star-pagination">*28</span> Court
            summarily denied the petition. <span class="citation">

            where it reasoned that "gain time allowance is an act of grace rather than a vested
            right and may be withdrawn, modified, or denied." Harris v. Wainwright, <span

         <p>The ex post facto prohibition<span class="sup">[8]</span> forbids the Congress and the
            States to enact any law "which imposes a punishment for an act which was not punishable
            at the time it was committed; or imposes additional punishment to that then prescribed."

            prohibition, the Framers sought to assure that legislative Acts give fair warning of

            ban also restricts governmental power by restraining arbitrary and potentially
            vindictive legislation. Malloy v. South Carolina, 237 U. S. 180, 183 (1915); Kring v.
            Missouri, supra, at 229; Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 138 (1810); Calder v. Bull,

         </p>
         <p>In accord with these purposes, our decisions prescribe that two critical elements must
            be present for a criminal or penal law to be ex post facto: it must be retrospective,
            that is, it must apply to events occurring before its enactment,<span class="sup"
               >[11]</span> and it must disadvantage the offender affected by it.<span class="sup"
               >[12]</span>Lindsey v. Washington, supra, at 401; Calder v. Bull, supra, at 390.
            Contrary to the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Florida, a law need not impair a
            "vested right" to violate the ex post facto prohibition.<span class="sup">[13]</span>
            Evaluating whether a right has vested <span class="star-pagination">*30</span> is
            important for claims under the Contracts or Due Process Clauses, which solely protect
            pre-existing entitlements. See, e. g., Wood v. Lovett, 313 U. S. 362, 371 (1941); Dodge
            v. Board of Education, 302 U. S. 74, 78-79 (1937). See also United States Railroad
            Retirement Board v. Fritz, 449 U. S. 166, 174 (1980). The presence or absence of an
            affirmative, enforceable right is not relevant, however, to the ex post facto
            prohibition, which forbids the imposition of punishment more severe than the punishment
            assigned by law when the act to be punished occurred. Critical to relief under the Ex
            Post Facto Clause is not an individual's right to less punishment, but the lack of fair
            notice and governmental restraint when the legislature increases punishment beyond what
            was prescribed when the crime was consummated. Thus, even if a statute merely alters
            penal provisions accorded by the grace of the legislature, it violates the Clause if it
            is both retrospective and more onerous than the law in effect on the date of <span
               class="star-pagination">*31</span> the offense.<span class="sup">[14]</span> We now
            consider the Florida statute in light of these two considerations.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>The respondent maintains that Florida's 1978 law altering the availability of gain time
            is not retrospective because, on its face, it applies only after its effective date.
            Brief for Respondent 12, 15-16. This argument fails to acknowledge that it is the
            effect, not the form, of the law that determines whether it is ex post facto.<span
               class="sup">[15]</span> The critical question is whether the law changes the legal
            consequences of acts completed before its effective date. In the context of this case,
            this question can be recast as asking whether Fla. Stat. § 944.275 (1) (1979) applies to
            prisoners convicted for acts committed before the provision's effective date. Clearly,
            the answer is in the affirmative. The respondent concedes that the State uses § 944.275
            (1), which was implemented on January 1, 1979, to calculate the gain time available to
            petitioner, who was convicted of a crime occurring on January 31, 1976.<span class="sup"
               >[16]</span> Thus, the provision attaches legal consequences to a crime committed
            before the law took effect.</p>
         <p>Nonetheless, respondent contends that the State's revised gain-time provision is not
            retrospective because its predecessor was "no part of the original sentence and thus no
            part of the punishment annexed to the crime at the time petitioner was sentenced." Brief
            for Respondent 12. This contention <span class="star-pagination">*32</span> is
            foreclosed by our precedents. First, we need not determine whether the prospect of the
            gain time was in some technical sense part of the sentence to conclude that it in fact
            is one determinant of petitioner's prison term&#x97;and that his effective sentence is
            altered once this determinant is changed. See Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S., at
            401-402; Greenfield v. Scafati, <span class="citation no-link">

            </span> (Mass. 1967) (three-judge court), summarily aff'd, 390 U. S. 713 (1968). See
            also Rodriguez v. United States Parole Comm'n, 594 F. 2d 170 (CA7 1979) (elimination of
            parole eligibility held an ex post facto violation). We have previously recognized that
            a prisoner's eligibility for reduced imprisonment is a significant factor entering into
            both the defendant's decision to plea bargain and the judge's calculation of the
            sentence to be imposed. Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, 557 (1974); Warden v.
            Marrero, 417 U. S. 653, 658 (1974). See United States v. De Simone, 468 F. 2d 1196 (CA2
            1972); Durant v. United States, 410 F. 2d 689, 692 (CA1 1969). Second, we have held that
            a statute may be retrospective even if it alters punitive conditions outside the
            sentence. Thus, we have concluded that a statute requiring solitary confinement prior to
            execution is ex post facto when applied to someone who committed a capital offense prior
            to its enactment, but not when applied only prospectively. Compare In re Medley, 134 U.
            S. 160 (1890), with Holden v. Minnesota, 137 U. S. 483 (1890). See also Cummings v.

            <span class="star-pagination">*33</span> For prisoners who committed crimes before its
            enactment, § 944.275 (1) substantially alters the consequences attached to a crime
            already completed, and therefore changes "the quantum of punishment." See Dobbert v.
            Florida, 432 U. S., at 293-294. Therefore, it is a retrospective law which can be
            constitutionally applied to petitioner only if it is not to his detriment. Id., at

         <p>Whether a retrospective state criminal statute ameliorates or worsens conditions imposed
            by its predecessor is a federal question. Lindsey v. Washington, supra, at 400. See
            Malloy v. South Carolina, 237 U. S., at 184; Rooney v. North Dakota, 196 U. S., at 325.
            The inquiry looks to the challenged provision, and not to any special circumstances that
            may mitigate its effect on the particular individual. Dobbert v. Florida, supra, at 300;
            Lindsey v. Washington, supra, at 401; Rooney v. North Dakota, supra, at 325.</p>
         <p>Under this inquiry, we conclude § 944.275 (1) is disadvantageous to petitioner and other
            similarly situated prisoners. On its face, the statute reduces the number of monthly
            gain-time credits available to an inmate who abides by prison rules and adequately
            performs his assigned tasks. By definition, this reduction in gain-time accumulation
            lengthens the period that someone in petitioner's position must spend in prison. In
            Lindsey v. Washington, supra, at 401-402, we reasoned that "[i]t is plainly to the
            substantial disadvantage of petitioners to be deprived of all opportunity to receive a
            sentence which would give them freedom from custody and control prior to the expiration
            of the 15-year term." Here, petitioner is similarly disadvantaged by the reduced <span
               class="star-pagination">*34</span> opportunity to shorten his time in prison simply
            through good conduct. In Greenfield v. Scafati, supra, we affirmed the judgment of a
            three-judge District Court which found an ex post facto violation in the application of
            a statute denying any gain time for the first six months after parole revocation to an
            inmate whose crime occurred before the statute's enactment. There, as here, the inmate
            was disadvantaged by new restrictions on eligibility for release. In this vein, the
            three-judge court in Greenfield found "no distinction between depriving a prisoner of
            the right to earn good conduct deductions and the right to qualify for, and hence earn,
            parole. Each . . . materially `alters the situation of the accused to his
            disadvantage.'" 277 F. Supp., at 646 (quoting In re Medley, supra, at 171). See also

            </span>, 52 N. E. 505 (1899).</p>
         <p>Respondent argues that our inquiry should not end at this point because Fla. Stat. §
            944.275 (1) (1979) must be examined in conjunction with other provisions enacted with
            it. Brief for Respondent 18-26. Respondent claims that the net effect of all these
            provisions is increased availability of gain-time deductions.<span class="sup"
               >[18]</span> There can be no doubt that the legislature <span class="star-pagination"
               >*35</span> intended through these provisions to promote rehabilitation and to create
            incentives for specified productive conduct. See Fla. Stat. § 944.012 (1979). But none
            of these provisions for extra gain time compensates for the reduction of gain time
            available solely for good conduct. The fact remains that an inmate who performs
            satisfactory work and avoids disciplinary violations could obtain more gain time per
            month under the repealed provision, § 944.27 (1) (1975), than he could for the same
            conduct under the new provision, § 944.275 (1) (1979). To make up the difference, the
            inmate has to satisfy the extra conditions specified by the discretionary gain-time
               provisions.<span class="sup">[19]</span> Even then, the award of the extra gain time
            is purely discretionary, contingent on both the wishes of the correctional authorities
            and special behavior by the inmate, such as saving a life or diligent performance in an
            academic program. Fla. Stat. §§ 944.275 (3) (a), (b) (1979). In contrast, under both the
            new and old statutes, an inmate is automatically entitled to the monthly gain time
            simply for avoiding disciplinary infractions and performing his assigned tasks. Compare
            Fla. Stat. § 944.275 (1) (1979) with § 944.27 (1) (1975).<span class="sup">[20]</span>
            Thus, the new provision constricts the inmate's <span class="star-pagination">*36</span>
            opportunity to earn early release, and thereby makes more onerous the punishment for
            crimes committed before its enactment. This result runs afoul of the prohibition against
            ex post facto laws.<span class="sup">[21]</span>

         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>We find Fla. Stat. § 944.275 (1) (1979) void as applied to petitioner, whose crime
            occurred before its effective date. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Supreme
            Court of Florida and remand this case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this
               opinion.<span class="sup">[22]</span>

         <p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring in the judgment.</p>
         <p>Were the Court writing on a clean slate, I would vote to affirm the judgment of the
            Supreme Court of Florida. My <span class="star-pagination">*37</span> thesis would be:
            (a) the 1978 Florida statute operates only prospectively and does not affect
            petitioner's credits earned and accumulated prior to the effective date of the statute;
            (b) "good time" or "gain time" is something to be earned and is not part of, or inherent
            in, the sentence imposed; (c) all the new statute did was to remove some of petitioner's
            hope and a portion of his opportunity; and (d) his sentence therefore was not enhanced
            by the statute. In addition, as the Court's 18th footnote reveals, ante, at 34-35, the
            statutory change by no means was entirely restrictive; in certain respects it was more
            lenient, as the Court's careful preservation for this prisoner of the new statute's
            other provisions clearly implies. Ante, at 36 and this page, n. 22.</p>
         <p>The Court's precedents, however, particularly Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397
            (1937), and the summary disposition of Greenfield v. Scafati, <span

      <div type="concurrence" judge="rehnquist">
         <p>JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concurring in the judgment.</p>
         <p>I find this case a close one. As the Court recently noted: "It is axiomatic that for a
            law to be ex post facto it must be more onerous than the prior law." Dobbert v. Florida,
            432 U. S. 282, 294 (1977). Petitioner was clearly disadvantaged by the loss of the
            opportunity to accrue gain time through good conduct pursuant to the 5-10-15 formula
            when the legislature changed to a 3-6-9 formula. The new statute, however, also afforded
            petitioner opportunities not available <span class="star-pagination">*38</span> under
            prior law to earn additional gain time beyond the good-conduct formula.<span class="sup"
               >[*]</span> The case is not resolved simply by comparing the 5-10-15 formula with the
            3-6-9 formula. "We must compare the two statutory procedures in toto to determine if the
            new may be fairly characterized as more onerous." Ibid.</p>
         <p>I am persuaded in this case, albeit not without doubt, that the new statute is more
            onerous than the old, because the amount of gain time which is accrued automatically
            solely through good conduct is substantially reduced, and this reduction is not offset
            by the availability of discretionary awards of gain time for activities extending beyond
            simply "staying out of trouble." This is not to say, however, that no reduction in
            automatic gain time, however slight, can ever be offset by increases in the availability
            of discretionary gain time, however great, or that reductions in the amount of credit
            for good conduct can never be offset by increases in the availability of credit which
            can be earned by more than merely good conduct.</p>
         <p>Since the availability of new opportunities for discretionary gain time and the
            reduction in the amount of automatic gain time can be viewed as a total package, it must
            be emphasized <span class="star-pagination">*39</span> that nothing in today's decision
            compels Florida to provide prisoners in petitioner's position with the benefits of the
            new provisions when this Court has held that Florida may not require such prisoners to
            pay the price. It is not at all clear that the Florida Legislature would have intended
            to make available the new discretionary gain time to prisoners earning automatic gain
            time under the old 5-10-15 formula, when the legislature in fact reduced the 5-10-15
            formula when it enacted the new provisions. The question is, of course, one for Florida
            to resolve.</p>

         <p>[1] Fla. Stat. § 944.275(1) (1979); Fla. Stat. § 944.27 (1) (1975). At the time of
            petitioner's offense, Florida used the term "good-time," to refer to extra "allowance
            for meritorious conduct or exceptional industry." Fla. Stat. § 944.29 (1975). The
            current Florida law adopts the phrase "gain-time" to apply to various kinds of time
            credited to reduce a prisoner's prison term. See, e. g., Fla. Stat. § 944.275 (3)
            (1979).</p>
         <p>[2] The statute also provided for extra discretionary good time, based on other factors.
            See n. 18, infra.</p>
         <p>[3] There are some minor language differences in the new provision directing the
            correctional authorities at the Department of Offender Rehabilitation to make the
            gain-time deductions. The phrase "who has performed in a satisfactory and acceptable
            manner the work, duties, and tasks assigned," Fla. Stat. § 944.275 (1) (1979), replaces
            the former phrase, "who has performed in a faithful, diligent, industrious, orderly, and
            peaceful manner the work, duties, and tasks assigned," Fla. Stat. § 944.27 (1) (1975).
            The new version also explicitly adds that the deductions are to be made "on a monthly
            basis, as earned," which appears to codify the previous practice. The State Supreme
            Court assigned no significance to these differences in evaluating the ex post facto
            claim, nor does any party here assert that these minor language changes are relevant to
            our inquiry.</p>
         <p>[4] No saving clause limiting the Act's application was included. 1978 Fla. Laws, ch.
            78-304. In applying the new schedule to prisoners like petitioner, the Secretary of the
            Department of Offender Rehabilitation relied on the legal opinion of the Attorney
            General of Florida. Fla. Op. Atty. Gen. 078-96 (1978).</p>
         <p>[5] "No State shall . . . pass any . . . ex post facto Law." U. S. Const., Art. I, § 10,
            cl. 1. The Florida Constitution similarly provides that "[n]o . . . ex post facto law .
            . . shall be passed." Fla. Const., Art. I, § 10. See also Fla. Const., Art. X, § 9
            (forbidding state legislature to enact a statute "affect[ing] [the] prosecution or
            punishment" for any offense previously committed).</p>
         <p>[6] Petitioner estimated that his "tentative expiration date" under Fla. Stat. § 944.27
            (1975) would be December 31, 1984. App. 15a. The State calculated that application of
            the new gain-time provision starting with its effective date resulted in a projected
            release date of February 2, 1987. Id., at 12a-13a. The State does not dispute
            petitioner's contention that a difference of over two years is at stake.</p>
         <p>[7] The Florida court also distinguished cases from other jurisdictions striking down
            retrospective statutes that eliminated the allowance of gain time in specified
            situations, revised the entire scheme of criminal penalties, and extended the
            incarceration of juvenile offenders. 376 So. 2d, at 857 (distinguishing Dowd v. Sims,

            post facto law is one which renders an act punishable in a manner in which it was not
            punishable when it was committed").</p>
         <p>[10] The ex post facto prohibition also upholds the separation of powers by confining
            the legislature to penal decisions with prospective effect and the judiciary and
            executive to applications of existing penal law. Cf. Ogden v. Blackledge, 2 Cranch 272,
            277 (1804).</p>
         <p>[11] See Jaehne v. New York, 128 U. S. 189, 194 (1888) (portion of legislation void
            which "`should endeavor to reach by its retroactive operation acts before committed'")
            (quoting T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 215 (5th ed. 1883)).</p>
         <p>[12] We have also held that no ex post facto violation occurs if the change effected is
            merely procedural, and does "not increase the punishment nor change the ingredients of
            the offense or the ultimate facts necessary to establish guilt." Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S.
            574, 590 (1884). See Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282, 293 (1977). Alteration of a
            substantial right, however, is not merely procedural, even if the statute takes a
            seemingly procedural form. Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343, 354-355 (1898); Kring v.
            Missouri, supra, at 232.</p>
         <p>[13] In using the concept of vested rights, Harris v. Wainwright, 376 So. 2d, at 856,
            the Florida court apparently drew on the test for evaluating retrospective laws in a
            civil context. See 2 C. Sands, Sutherland on Statutory Construction § 41.06 (4th ed.
            1973); Hochman, The Supreme Court and the Constitutionality of Retroactive Legislation,
            73 Harv. L. Rev. 692, 696 (1960); Smead, The Rule Against Retroactive Legislation: A
            Basic Principle of Jurisprudence, 20 Minn. L. Rev. 775, 782 (1936). Discussion of vested
            rights has seldom appeared in ex post facto analysis, as in identifying whether the
            challenged change is substantive rather than procedural. Hopt v. Utah, supra, at 590.
            When a court engages in ex post facto analysis, which is concerned solely with whether a
            statute assigns more disadvantageous criminal or penal consequences to an act than did
            the law in place when the act occurred, it is irrelevant whether the statutory change
            touches any vested rights. Several state courts have properly distinguished vested
            rights from ex post facto concerns. E. g., State v. Curtis, <span class="citation">

         <p>Respondent here advances several theories that incorporate the vested rights approach.
            For example, respondent defends Fla. Stat. § 944.275 (1) (1979) on the ground that it
            does not take away any gain time that petitioner has already earned. Brief for
            Respondent 39-40. Although this point might have pertinence were petitioner alleging a
            due process violation, see Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539 (1974), it has no relevance
            to his ex post facto claim.</p>

         <p>[17] Even when the sentence is at issue, a law may be retrospective not only if it
            alters the length of the sentence, but also if it changes the maximum sentence from
            discretionary to mandatory. Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397, 401 (1937). The
            critical question, as Florida has often acknowledged, is whether the new provision
            imposes greater punishment after the commission of the offense, not merely whether it
            increases a criminal sentence. Greene v. State, <span class="citation">

            </span>, 282 (Fla. App. 1966). Thus in Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282 (1977), we held
            there was no ex post facto violation because the challenged provisions changed the role
            of jury and judge in sentencing, but did not add to the "quantum of punishment." Id., at
            293-294. In Malloy v. South Carolina, 237 U. S. 180 (1915), we concluded that a change
            in the method of execution was not ex post facto because evidence showed the new method
            to be more humane, not because the change in the execution method was not retrospective.
            Id., at 185.</p>
         <p>[18] These other provisions permit discretionary grants of additional gain time for
            inmates who not only satisfy the good-conduct requirement, but who also deserve extra
            reward under designated categories. Under § 944.275 (3) (b) (1979), "special gain-time"
            of 1 to 60 days "may be granted" to an "inmate who does some outstanding deed, such as
            the saving of a life or assisting in the recapturing of an escaped inmate." Another
            provision specifies that an inmate "may be granted" one to six extra gain-time days per
            month if he "faithfully performs the assignments given to him in a conscientious manner
            over and above that which may normally be expected of him" and also either shows "his
            desire to be a better than average inmate" or "diligently participates in an approved
            course of academic or vocation study." § 944.275 (3) (a). An inmate may be awarded up to
            one gain-time credit for labor evaluated "on the basis of diligence of the inmate, the
            quality and quantity of work performed, and the skill required for performance of the
            work." § 944.275 (2) (b). Finally, for inmates unable to qualify under this previous
            provision due to "age, illness, infirmity, or confinement for reasons other than
            discipline," additional gain time of up to six days per month may be granted for
            "constructive utilization of time." § 944.275 (2) (e).</p>
         <p>[19] In addition, few of the "new" sources for extra gain time do more than reiterate
            previous opportunities provided by statute or state regulation. Compare Fla. Stat. §
            944.275 (3) (a) (1979) with § 944.29 (1975) ("an extra good-time allowance for
            meritorious conduct or exceptional industry"); Fla. Stat. § 944.275 (2) (b) (1979) with
            § 944.27 (1975) (authorizing administrative rules governing additional gain time) and
            Fla. Admin. Code, Rule 10B-20.04 (1) (1975) (gain time for construction labor project);
            Fla. Stat. § 944.275 (3) (b) (1979) with Rule 10B-20.04 (2) (1975) (gain time for
            outstanding deed). Moreover, under the statute in existence when petitioner's crime
            occurred, the Department of Corrections enjoyed greater discretion as to the reasons for
            awarding extra gain time, and as to the amount that could be awarded. See § 944.29
            (1975).</p>
         <p>[20] As respondent put it, "all any prisoner had to do . . . was to stay out of
            trouble." Brief for Respondent 25. The monthly gain-time provision, both at the time of
            petitioner's offense and now, directed that the Department of Corrections "shall" award
            gain time to those who obey the rules and perform their work satisfactorily. Fla. Stat.
            § 944.27 (1) (1975); Fla. Stat. § 944.275 (1) (1979). The discretionary extra gain time
            cannot fully compensate for the reduced accumulation of gain time for good behavior, for
            the discretionary credit is more uncertain. Cf. In re Medley, 134 U. S. 160, 172 (1890)
            (rejecting nondisclosure of execution date as ex post facto increase of uncertainty and
            mental anxiety). Moreover, replacement of mandatory sentence reduction with
            discretionary sentence reduction cannot be permissible in light of Lindsey v.
            Washington, 301 U. S., at 401. There, we rejected as an ex post facto violation a
            legislative change from flexible sentencing to mandatory maximum sentencing because the
            retrospective legislation restricted defendants' opportunity to serve less than the
            maximum time in prison.</p>
         <p>[21] We need not give lengthy consideration to respondent's claim that the challenged
            statute, Fla. Stat. § 944.275 (1) (1979), is merely procedural because it does not alter
            the punishment prescribed for petitioner's offense. Brief for Respondent 13, 17-18. This
            contention is incorrect, given the uncontested fact that the new provision reduces the
            quantity of gain time automatically available, and does not merely alter procedures for
            its allocation. See supra, Part II-A. Respondent's reliance on a general statement of
            legislative intent unrelated to the gain-time provision, see Brief for Respondent 17
            (citing Fla. Stat. § 944.012 (6) (1979)), is also unpersuasive.</p>
         <p>[22] The proper relief upon a conclusion that a state prisoner is being treated under an
            ex post facto law is to remand to permit the state court to apply, if possible, the law
            in place when his crime occurred. See Lindsey v. Washington, supra, at 402, In re
            Medley, supra, at 173. In remanding for this relief, we note that only the ex post facto
            portion of the new law is void as to petitioner, and therefore any severable provisions
            which are not ex post facto may still be applied to him. See 2 C. Sands, Sutherland on
            Statutory Construction § 44.04 (4th ed. 1973).</p>
         <p>[*] While the Court points out that gain time was available under the old scheme beyond
            the 5-10-15 formula, ante, at 35, n. 19, I am not convinced that the new sources simply
            "reiterate[d]" opportunities previously available. There is, for example, no dispute
            that several of the new sources of gain time have no analogues in the previous statutory
            or administrative scheme. See, e. g., Fla. Stat. § 944.275 (2) (e) (1979) (up to six
            days of gain time per month because of age, illness, infirmity, or confinement for
            reasons other than discipline); § 944.275 (3) (a) (up to six days per month for inmates
            who diligently participate in an approved course of academic or vocational study). Other
            new statutory provisions which had only administrative counterparts improved
            substantially on the availability of gain time. For example, under the old
            administrative system, an inmate could receive from 1 to 15 days of gain time per month
            for constructive labor, Fla. Admin. Code, Rule 10B-20.04 (1) (1975), while under the new
            statutory scheme, an inmate can receive up to 1 day of gain time for every day of
            constructive labor, Fla. Stat. § 944.275 (2) (b) (1979).</p>
