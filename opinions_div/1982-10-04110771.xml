         <p> Syllabus </p>
         <p>The Bankruptcy Act of 1978 (Act) established a United States bankruptcy court in each
            judicial district as an adjunct to the district court for such district. The bankruptcy
            court judges are appointed for 14-year terms, subject to removal by the judicial council
            of the circuit in which they serve on grounds of incompetence, misconduct, neglect of
            duty, or disability. Their salaries are set by statute and are subject to adjustment.
            The Act grants the bankruptcy courts jurisdiction over "all civil proceedings arising
            under title 11 [bankruptcy] [of the United States Code] or arising in or related to
            cases under title 11." See 28 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1471(b) (1976 ed., Supp.IV). After it
            had filed a petition for reorganization in a Bankruptcy Court, appellant Northern
            Pipeline Construction Co. (Northern) filed in that court a suit against appellee
            Marathon Pipe Line Co. (Marathon) seeking damages for an alleged breach of contract and
            warranty, as well as for misrepresentation, coercion, and duress. Marathon sought
            dismissal of the suit on the ground that the Act unconstitutionally conferred Art. III
            judicial power upon judges who lacked life tenure and protection against salary
            diminution. The Bankruptcy Court denied the motion to dismiss, but on appeal the
            District Court granted the motion.</p>
         <p>Held: The judgment is affirmed.</p>

         <p>Justice BRENNAN, joined by Justice MARSHALL, Justice BLACKMUN, and Justice STEVENS,
            concluded that:</p>


         <span class="num">1</span>
         <p>1. Section 1471's broad grant of jurisdiction to bankruptcy judges violates Art. III.
            Pp. 57-87.</p>


         <span class="num">2</span>
         <p>(a) The judicial power of the United States must be exercised by judges who have the
            attributes of life tenure and protection against salary diminution specified by Art.
            III. These attributes were incorporated into the Constitution to ensure the independence
            of the Judiciary from the control of the Executive and Legislative Branches. There is no
            doubt that bankruptcy judges created by the Act are not Art. III judges. Pp. 57-62.</p>


         <span class="num">3</span>
         <p>(b) Article III bars Congress from establishing under its Art. I powers legislative
            courts to exercise jurisdiction over all matters arising under the bankruptcy laws. The
            establishment of such courts does not fall within any of the historically recognized
            situations&amp;#8212;non-Art. III courts of the Territories or of the District of
            Columbia, courts-martial, and resolution of "public rights" issues&amp;#8212;in which
            the principle of independent adjudication commanded by Art. III does not apply. The
            bankruptcy courts do not lie exclusively outside the States, like the courts of the
            Territories or of the District of Columbia, or bear any resemblance to courts-martial,
            nor can the substantive legal rights at issue in the present action&amp;#8212;the right
            to recover contract damages to augment Northern's estate&amp;#8212;be deemed "public
            rights." There is no persuasive reason in logic, history, or the Constitution, why
            bankruptcy courts lie beyond the reach of Art. III. Pp. 63-76.</p>


         <span class="num">4</span>
         <p>(c) Section 1471 impermissibly removed most, if not all, of the essential attributes of
            the judicial power from the Art. III district court and vested those attributes in a
            non-Art. III adjunct. Crowell v. Benson, <span class="citation">

            power to create adjuncts to adjudicate constitutionally recognized rights and
            state-created rights as it does to adjudicate rights that it creates. The grant of
            jurisdiction to bankruptcy courts cannot be sustained as an exercise of Congress' power
            to create adjuncts to Art. III courts. Pp. 76-87.</p>


         <span class="num">5</span>
         <p>2. The above holding that the broad grant of jurisdiction in &amp;#167; 1471 is
            unconstitutional shall not apply retroactively but only prospectively. Such grant of
            jurisdiction presents an unprecedented question of interpretation of Art. III, and
            retroactive application would not further the operation of the holding but would visit
            substantial injustice and hardship upon those litigants who relied upon the Act's
            vesting of jurisdiction in the bankruptcy courts. Pp.87-88</p>


         <span class="num">6</span>
         <p>Justice REHNQUIST, joined by Justice O'CONNOR, concluded that where appellee Marathon
            Pipe Line Co. has simply been named defendant in appellant Northern Pipeline
            Construction Co.'s suit on a contract claim arising under state law, the
            constitutionality of the Bankruptcy Court's exercise of jurisdiction over that kind of
            suit is all that need be decided in this case; that resolution of any objections
            Marathon might make to the exercise of authority conferred on bankruptcy courts by the
            Bankruptcy Act of 1978, on the ground that the suit must be decided by an Art. III
            court, should await the exercise of such authority; that so much of that Act as enables
            a Bankruptcy Court to entertain and decide Northern's suit over Marathon's objection
            violates Art. III; and that the Court's judgment should not be applied retroactively.

         <p>The question presented is whether the assignment by Congress to bankruptcy judges of the

            241(a) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 violates Art. III of the Constitution.</p>

         <p>In 1978, after almost 10 years of study and investigation, Congress enacted a
            comprehensive revision of the bankruptcy laws. The Bankruptcy Act of 1978 (Act)<a
               class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref">1</a> made significant changes in both the
            substantive and procedural law of bankruptcy. It is the changes in the latter that are
            at issue in this case.</p>


         <span class="num">14</span>
         <p>Before the Act, federal district courts served as bankruptcy courts and employed a
            "referee" system. Bankruptcy proceedings were generally conducted before referees,<a
               class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref">2</a> except in those instances in which
            the district court elected to withdraw a case from a referee. See Bkrtcy. Rule 102. The
            referee's final order was appealable to the district court. Bkrtcy. Rule 801. The
            bankruptcy courts were vested with "summary jurisdiction"&amp;#8212;that is, with
            jurisdiction over controversies involving property in the actual or constructive
            possession of the court. And, with consent, the bankruptcy court also had jurisdiction
            over some "plenary" matters&amp;#8212;such as disputes involving property in the
            possession of a third person.</p>


         <span class="num">15</span>
         <p>The Act eliminates the referee system and establishes "in each judicial district, as an
            adjunct to the district court for such district, a bankruptcy court which shall be a
            court of record known as the United States Bankruptcy Court for the district." 28 U.S.C.
            &amp;#167; 151(a) (1976 ed., Supp.IV). The judges of these courts are appointed to
            office for 14-year terms by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate.
            &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 152, 153(a) (1976 ed., Supp.IV). They are subject to removal by the
            "judicial council of the circuit" on account of "incompetency, misconduct, neglect of
            duty or physical or mental disability." &amp;#167; 153(b) (1976 ed., Supp.IV). In
            addition, the salaries of the bankruptcy judges are set by statute and are subject to
            adjustment under the Federal Salary Act, 2 U.S.C. &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 351-361 (1976 ed.
            and Supp.IV). 28 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 154 (1976 ed., Supp.IV).</p>


         <span class="num">16</span>
         <p>The jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts created by the Act is much broader than that
            exercised under the former referee system. Eliminating the distinction between "summary"
            and "plenary" jurisdiction, the Act grants the new courts jurisdiction over all "civil
            proceedings arising under title 11 [the Bankruptcy title] or arising in or related to
            cases under title 11." 28 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1471(b) (1976 ed., Supp.IV) (emphasis
               added).<a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref">3</a> This jurisdictional grant
            empowers bankruptcy courts to entertain a wide variety of cases involving claims that
            may affect the property of the estate once a petition has been filed under Title 11.
            Included within the bankruptcy courts' jurisdiction are suits to recover accounts,
            controversies involving exempt property, actions to avoid transfers and payments as
            preferences or fraudulent conveyances, and causes of action owned by the debtor at the
            time of the petition for bankruptcy. The bankruptcy courts can hear claims based on
            state law as well as those based on federal law. See 1 W. Collier, Bankruptcy &amp;#182;
            3.01, pp. 3-47 to 3-48 (15th ed. 1982).<a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref"
               >4</a>
         </p>


         <span class="num">17</span>
         <p>The judges of the bankruptcy courts are vested with all of the "powers of a court of
            equity, law, and admiralty," except that they "may not enjoin another court or punish a
            criminal contempt not committed in the presence of the judge of the court or warranting
            a punishment of imprisonment." 28 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1481 (1976 ed., Supp.IV). In
            addition to this broad grant of power, Congress has allowed bankruptcy judges the power
            to hold jury trials, &amp;#167; 1480; to issue declaratory judgments, &amp;#167; 2201;

         <p>The Act also establishes a special procedure for appeals from orders of bankruptcy
            courts. The circuit council is empowered to direct the chief judge of the circuit to
            designate panels of three bankruptcy judges to hear appeals. 28 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 160
            (1976 ed., Supp.IV). These panels have jurisdiction of all appeals from final judgments,
            orders, and decrees of bankruptcy courts, and, with leave of the panel, of interlocutory
            appeals. &amp;#167; 1482. If no such appeals panel is designated, the district court is
            empowered to exercise appellate jurisdiction. &amp;#167; 1334. The court of appeals is
            given jurisdiction over appeals from the appellate panels or from the district court.
            &amp;#167; 1293. If the parties agree, a direct appeal to the court of appeals may be
            taken from a final judgment of a bankruptcy court. &amp;#167; 1293(b).<a

         <p>This case arises out of proceedings initiated in the United States Bankruptcy Court for
            the District of Minnesota after appellant Northern Pipeline Construction Co. (Northern)
            filed a petition for reorganization in January 1980. In March 1980 Northern, pursuant to
            the Act, filed in that court a suit against appellee Marathon Pipe Line Co. (Marathon).
            Appellant sought damages for alleged breaches of contract and warranty, as well as for
            alleged misrepresentation, coercion, and duress. Marathon sought dismissal of the suit,
            on the ground that the Act unconstitutionally conferred Art. III judicial power upon
            judges who lacked life tenure and protection against salary diminution. The United
            States intervened to defend the validity of the statute.</p>

         <p>Basic to the constitutional structure established by the Framers was their recognition
            that "[t]he accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the
            same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or
            elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny." The Federalist No.
            47, p. 300 (H. Lodge ed. 1888) (J. Madison). To ensure against such tyranny, the Framers
            provided that the Federal Government would consist of three distinct Branches, each to
            exercise one of the governmental powers recognized by the Framers as inherently
            distinct. "The Framers regarded the checks and balances that they had built into the
            tripartite Federal Government as a self-executing safeguard against the encroachment or
            aggrandizement of one branch at the expense of the other." Buckley v. Valeo, <span

         <span class="num">23</span>
         <p>The Federal Judiciary was therefore designed by the Framers to stand independent of the
            Executive and Legislature&amp;#8212;to maintain the checks and balances of the
            constitutional structure, and also to guarantee that the process of adjudication itself
            remained impartial. Hamilton explained the importance of an independent Judiciary:</p>


         <span class="num">24</span>
         <p>"Periodical appointments, however regulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in some way
            or other, be fatal to [the courts'] necessary independence. If the power of making them
            was committed either to the Executive or legislature, there would be danger of an
            improper complaisance to the branch which possessed it; if to both, there would be an
            unwillingness to hazard the displeasure of either; if to the people, or to persons
            chosen by them for the special purpose, there would be too great a disposition to
            consult popularity, to justify a reliance that nothing would be consulted but the
            Constitution and the laws." The Federalist No. 78, p. 489 (H. Lodge ed. 1888).</p>


         <span class="num">25</span>
         <p>The Court has only recently reaffirmed the significance of this feature of the Framers'
            design: "A Judiciary free from control by the Executive and Legislature is essential if
            there is a right to have claims decided by judges who are free from potential domination
            by other branches of government." United States v. Will, <span class="citation">

         <p>As an inseparable element of the constitutional system of checks and balances, and as a
            guarantee of judicial impartiality, Art. III both defines the power and protects the
            independence of the Judicial Branch. It provides that "The judicial Power of the United
            States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the
            Congress may from time to time ordain and establish." Art. III, &amp;#167; 1. The
            inexorable command of this provision is clear and definites The judicial power of the
            United States must be exercised by courts having the attributes prescribed in Art. III.
            Those attributes are also clearly set forth:</p>


         <span class="num">27</span>
         <p>"The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during

            Will, supra, 449 U.S., at 218-221, 101 S.Ct., at 482-483. Both of these provisions were
            incorporated into the Constitution to ensure the independence of the Judiciary from the
            control of the Executive and Legislative Branches of government.<a class="footnote"
               href="#fn10" id="fn10_ref">10</a> As we have only recently emphasized, "[t]he
            Compensation Clause has its roots in the longstanding Anglo-American tradition of an
            independent Judiciary," 449 U.S., at 217, 101 S.Ct. at 482, while the principle of life
            tenure can be traced back at least as far as the Act of Settlement in 1701, id., at 218,
            101 S.Ct., at 482. To be sure, both principles were eroded during the late colonial
            period, but that departure did not escape notice and indignant rejection by the
            Revolutionary generation. Indeed, the guarantees eventually included in Art. III were
            clearly foreshadowed in the Declaration of Independence, "which, among the injuries and
            usurpations recited against the King of Great Britain, declared that he had 'made judges
            dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment

         <p>In sum, our Constitution unambiguously enunciates a fundamental principle&amp;#8212;that
            the "judicial Power of the United States" must be reposed in an independent Judiciary.
            It commands that the independence of the Judiciary be jealously guarded, and it provides
            clear institutional protections for that independence.</p>

         <p>It is undisputed that the bankruptcy judges whose offices were created by the Bankruptcy
            Act of 1978 do not enjoy the protections constitutionally afforded to Art. III judges.
            The bankruptcy judges do not serve for life subject to their continued "good Behaviour."
            Rather, they are appointed for 14-year terms, and can be removed by the judicial council
            of the circuit in which they serve on grounds of "incompetency, misconduct, neglect of
            duty, or physical or mental disability." Second, the salaries of the bankruptcy judges
            are not immune from diminution by Congress. See supra, at 53. In short, there is no
            doubt that the bankruptcy judges created by the Act are not Art. III judges.</p>


         <span class="num">32</span>
         <p>That Congress chose to vest such broad jurisdiction in non-Art. III bankruptcy courts,

         <span class="num">33</span>
         <p>With these principles in mind, we turn to the question presented for decision: whether
            the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 violates the command of Art. III that the judicial power of
            the United States must be vested in courts whose judges enjoy the protections and
            safeguards specified in that Article.</p>


         <span class="num">34</span>
         <p>Appellants suggest two grounds for upholding the Act's conferral of broad adjudicative
            powers upon judges unprotected by Art. III. First, it is urged that "pursuant to its
            enumerated Article I powers, Congress may establish legislative courts that have
            jurisdiction to decide cases to which the Article III judicial power of the United
            States extends." Brief for United States 9. Referring to our precedents upholding the
            validity of "legislative courts," appellants suggest that "the plenary grants of power
            in Article I permit Congress to establish non-Article III tribunals in 'specialized
            areas having particularized needs and warranting distinctive treatment,' " such as the
            area of bankruptcy law. Ibid., quoting Palmore v. United States, supra, at 389, 408, 93
            S.Ct., at 1681. Second, appellants contend that even if the Constitution does require
            that this bankruptcy-related action be adjudicated in an Art. III court, the Act in fact
            satisfies that requirement. "Bankruptcy jurisdiction was vested in the district court"
            of the judicial district in which the bankruptcy court is located, "and the exercise of
            that jurisdiction by the adjunct bankruptcy court was made subject to appeal as of right
            to an Article III court." Brief for United States 12. Analogizing the role of the
            bankruptcy court to that of a special master, appellants urge us to conclude that this
            "adjunct" system established by Congress satisfies the requirements of Art. III. We
            consider these arguments in turn.</p>

         <p>III</p>

         <span class="num">35</span>
         <p>Congress did not constitute the bankruptcy courts as legislative courts.<a
               class="footnote" href="#fn13" id="fn13_ref">13</a> Appellants contend, however, that
            the bankruptcy courts could have been so constituted, and that as a result the "adjunct"
            system in fact chosen by Congress does not impermissibly encroach upon the judicial
            power. In advancing this argument, appellants rely upon cases in which we have
            identified certain matters that "congress may or may not bring within the cognizance of
            [Art. III courts], as it may deem proper." Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land &amp;amp;

            But when properly understood, these precedents represent no broad departure from the
            constitutional command that the judicial power of the United States must be vested in
            Art. IIIcourts.<a class="footnote" href="#fn15" id="fn15_ref">15</a> Rather, they reduce
            to three narrow situations not subject to that command, each recognizing a circumstance
            in which the grant of power to the Legislative and Executive Branches was historically
            and constitutionally so exceptional that the congressional assertion of a power to
            create legislative courts was consistent with, rather than threatening to, the
            constitutional mandate of separation of powers. These precedents simply acknowledge that
            the literal command of Art. III, assigning the judicial power of the United States to
            courts insulated from Legislative or Executive interference, must be interpreted in
            light of the historical context in which the Constitution was written, and of the
            structural imperatives of the Constitution as a whole.</p>


         <span class="num">36</span>
         <p>Appellants first rely upon a series of cases in which this Court has upheld the creation
            by Congress of non-Art. III "territorial courts." This exception from the general
            prescription of Art. III dates from the earliest days of the Republic, when it was
            perceived that the Framers intended that as to certain geographical areas, in which no
            State operated as sovereign, Congress was to exercise the general powers of government.
            For example, in American Ins. Co. v. Canter, <span class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">1</span>
               <span class="reporter">Pet.</span>
               <span class="page">511</span>
            </span>, 7 L.Ed. 242 (1828), the Court observed that Art. IV bestowed upon Congress
            alone a complete power of government over territories not within the States that
            constituted the United States. The Court then acknowledged Congress' authority to create
            courts for those territories that were not in conformity with Art. III. Such courts
            were</p>


         <span class="num">37</span>
         <p>"created in virtue of the general right of sovereignty which exists in the government,
            or in virtue of that clause which enables Congress to make all needful rules and
            regulations, respecting the territory belonging to the United States. The jurisdiction
            with which they are invested . . . is conferred by Congress, in the execution of those
            general powers which that body possesses over the territories of the United States.
            Although admiralty jurisdiction can be exercised in the states in those Courts, only,
            which are established in pursuance of the third article of the Constitution; the same
            limitation does not extend to the territories. In legislating for them, Congress
            exercises the combined powers of the general, and of a state government." 1 Pet., at
            546.</p>


         <span class="num">38</span>
         <p>The Court followed the same reasoning when it reviewed Congress' creation of non-Art.
            III courts in the District of Columbia. It noted that there was in the District</p>


         <span class="num">39</span>
         <p>"no division of powers between the general and state governments. Congress has the
            entire control over the district for every purpose of government; and it is reasonable
            to suppose, that in organizing a judicial department here, all judicial power necessary
            for the purposes of government would be vested in the courts of justice." Kendall v.

         <p>Appellants next advert to a second class of cases&amp;#8212;those in which this Court
            has sustained the exercise by Congress and the Executive of the power to establish and
            administer courts-martial. The situation in these cases strongly resembles the situation
            with respect to territorial courts: It too involves a constitutional grant of power that
            has been historically understood as giving the political Branches of Government
            extraordinary control over the precise subject matter at issue. Article I, &amp;#167; 8,
            cls. 13, 14, confer upon Congress the power "[t]o provide and maintain a Navy," and
            "[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces." The
            Fifth Amendment, which requires a presentment or indictment of a grand jury before a
            person may be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, contains an
            express exception for "cases arising in the land or naval forces." And Art. II,
            &amp;#167; 2, cl. 1, provides that "The President shall be Commander in Chief of the
            Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when
            called into the actual Service of the United States." Noting these constitutional
            directives, the Court in Dynes v. Hoover, <span class="citation no-link">

            it and the 3d article of the Constitution defining the judicial power of the United
            States; indeed, that the two powers are entirely independent of each other." Id., at

            a third group of cases, in which this Court has upheld the constitutionality of

            involving "public rights."<a class="footnote" href="#fn18" id="fn18_ref">18</a> The

            from its nature, is not a subject for judicial determination. At the same time there are
            matters, involving public rights, which may be presented in such form that the judicial
            power is capable of acting on them, and which are susceptible of judicial determination,

         <span class="num">43</span>
         <p>This doctrine may be explained in part by reference to the traditional principle of
            sovereign immunity, which recognizes that the Government may attach conditions to its
            consent to be sued. See id., at 283-285; see also Ex parte Bakelite Corp., <span

            also draws upon the principle of separation of powers, and a historical understanding
            that certain prerogatives were reserved to the political Branches of Government. The
            doctrine extends only to matters arising "between the Government and persons subject to

            Bakelite Corp., supra, 279 U.S., at 458, 49 S.Ct., at 416. The understanding of these
            cases is that the Framers expected that Congress would be free to commit such matters
            completely to nonjudicial executive determination, and that as a result there can be no
            constitutional objection to Congress' employing the less drastic expedient of committing
            their determination to a legislative court or an administrative agency. Crowell v.

         <span class="num">44</span>
         <p>The public-rights doctrine is grounded in a historically recognized distinction between
            matters that could be conclusively determined by the Executive and Legislative Branches
            and matters that are "inherently . . . judicial." Ex parte Bakelite Corp., supra, 279
            U.S., at 458, 49 S.Ct., at 416. See Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land &amp;amp;
            Improvement Co., 18 How., at 280-282. For example, the Court in Murray's Lessee looked
            to the law of England and the States at the time the Constitution was adopted, in order
            to determine whether the issue presented was customarily cognizable in the courts. Ibid.
            Concluding that the matter had not traditionally been one for judicial determination,
            the Court perceived no bar to Congress' establishment of summary procedures, outside of
            Art. III courts, to collect a debt due to the Government from one of its customs
               agents.<a class="footnote" href="#fn20" id="fn20_ref">20</a> On the same premise, the
            Court in Ex parte Bakelite Corp., supra, held that the Court of Customs Appeals had been
            properly constituted by Congress as a legislative court:</p>


         <span class="num">45</span>

            necessarily requires judicial determination, but only matters the determination of which
            may be, and at times has been, committed exclusively to executive officers." 279 U.S.,

         <p>The distinction between public rights and private rights has not been definitively

            it necessary to do so in the present cases, for it suffices to observe that a matter of
            public rights must at a minimum arise "between the government and others." Ex parte

         <p>In sum, this Court has identified three situations in which Art. III does not bar the
            creation of legislative courts. In each of these situations, the Court has recognized
            certain exceptional powers bestowed upon Congress by the Constitution or by historical
            consensus. Only in the face of such an exceptional grant of power has the Court declined
            to hold the authority of Congress subject to the general prescriptions of Art. III.<a
               class="footnote" href="#fn25" id="fn25_ref">25</a>
         </p>


         <span class="num">48</span>
         <p>We discern no such exceptional grant of power applicable in the cases before us. The
            courts created by the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 do not lie exclusively outside the States
            of the Federal Union, like those in the District of Columbia and the Territories. Nor do
            the bankruptcy courts bear any resemblance to courts-martial, which are founded upon the
            Constitution's grant of plenary authority over the Nation's military forces to the
            Legislative and Executive Branches. Finally, the substantive legal rights at issue in
            the present action cannot be deemed "public rights." Appellants argue that a discharge
            in bankruptcy is indeed a "public right," similar to such congressionally created
            benefits as "radio station licenses, pilot licenses, or certificates for common
            carriers" granted by administrative agencies. See Brief for United States 34. But the
            restructuring of debtor-creditor relations, which is at the core of the federal
            bankruptcy power, must be distinguished from the adjudication of state-created private
            rights, such as the right to recover contract damages that is at issue in this case. The
            former may well be a "public right," but the latter obviously is not. Appellant
            Northern's right to recover contract damages to augment its estate is "one of private
            right, that is, of the liability of one individual to another under the law as defined."

         <p>Recognizing that the present cases may not fall within the scope of any of our prior
            cases permitting the establishment of legislative courts, appellants argue that we
            should recognize an additional situation beyond the command of Art. III, sufficiently
            broad to sustain the Act. Appellants contend that Congress' constitutional authority to
            establish "uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States,"
            Art. I, &amp;#167; 8, cl. 4, carries with it an inherent power to establish legislative
            courts capable of adjudicating "bankruptcy-related controversies." Brief for United
            States 14. In support of this argument, appellants rely primarily upon a quotation from

         <span class="num">50</span>
         <p>"both Congress and this Court have recognized that . . . the requirements of Art. III,
            which are applicable where laws of national applicability and affairs of national
            concern are at stake, must in proper circumstances give way to accommodate plenary
            grants of power to Congress to legislate with respect to specialized areas having
            particularized needs and warranting distinctive treatment." Id., 407-408, 93 S.Ct., at
            1681.</p>


         <span class="num">51</span>
         <p>Appellants cite this language to support their proposition that a bankruptcy court
            created by Congress under its Art. I powers is constitutional, because the law of
            bankruptcy is a "specialized area," and Congress has found a "particularized need" that
            warrants "distinctive treatment." Brief for United States 20-33.</p>


         <span class="num">52</span>
         <p>Appellants' contention, in essence, is that pursuant to any of its Art. I powers,
            Congress may create courts free of Art. III's requirements whenever it finds that course
            expedient. This contention has been rejected in previous cases. See, e.g., Atlas Roofing
            Co. v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n, 430 U.S., at 450, n. 7, 97 S.Ct.,

            demonstrate that independent courts are not required for all federal adjudications,
            those cases also make it clear that where Art. III does apply, all of the legislative
            powers specified in Art. I and elsewhere are subject to it. See, e.g., Ex parte Bakelite
            Corp., 279 U.S., at 449, 49 S.Ct., at 412; United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, supra;
            American Ins. Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet., at 546; Murray's Lessee, 18 How., at 284. Cf.

         <span class="num">53</span>
         <p>The flaw in appellants' analysis is that it provides no limiting principle. It thus
            threatens to supplant completely our system of adjudication in independent Art. III
            tribunals and replace it with a system of "specialized" legislative courts. True,
            appellants argue that under their analysis Congress could create legislative courts
            pursuant only to some "specific" Art. I power, and "only when there is a particularized
            need for distinctive treatment." Brief for United States 22-23. They therefore assert
            that their analysis would not permit Congress to replace the independent Art. III
            Judiciary through a "wholesale assignment of federal judicial business to legislative
            courts." Ibid. But these "limitations" are wholly illusory. For example, Art. I,
            &amp;#167; 8, empowers Congress to enact laws, inter alia, regulating interstate
            commerce and punishing certain crimes. Art. I, &amp;#167; 8, cls. 3, 6. On appellants'
            reasoning Congress could provide for the adjudication of these and "related" matters by
            judges and courts within Congress' exclusive control.<a class="footnote" href="#fn27"
               id="fn27_ref">27</a> The potential for encroachment upon powers reserved to the
            Judicial Branch through the device of "specialized" legislative courts is dramatically
            evidenced in the jurisdiction granted to the courts created by the Act before us. The
            broad range of questions that can be brought into a bankruptcy court because they are
            "related to cases under title 11," 28 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1471(b) (1976 ed., Supp.IV), see
            supra, at 54, is the clearest proof that even when Congress acts through a "specialized"
            court, and pursuant to only one of its many Art. I powers, appellants' analysis fails to
            provide any real protection against the erosion of Art. III jurisdiction by the
            unilateral action of the political Branches. In short, to accept appellants' reasoning,
            would require that we replace the principles delineated in our precedents, rooted in
            history and the Constitution, with a rule of broad legislative discretion that could
            effectively eviscerate the constitutional guarantee of an independent Judicial Branch of
            the Federal Government.<a class="footnote" href="#fn28" id="fn28_ref">28</a>
         </p>


         <span class="num">54</span>
         <p>Appellants' reliance upon Palmore for such broad legislative discretion is misplaced. In
            the context of the issue decided in that case, the language quoted from the Palmore
            opinion, supra, at 72, offers no substantial support for appellants' argument. Palmore
            was concerned with the courts of the District of Columbia, a unique federal enclave over
            which "Congress has . . . entire control . . . for every purpose of government." Kendall
            v. United States, 12 Pet., at 619. The "plenary authority" under the District of
            Columbia Clause, Art. I, &amp;#167; 8, cl. 17, was the subject of the quoted passage and
            the powers granted under that Clause are obviously different in kind from the other
            broad powers conferred on Congress: Congress' power over the District of Columbia
            encompasses the full authority of government, and thus, necessarily, the Executive and
            Judicial powers as well as the Legislative. This is a power that is clearly possessed by
            Congress only in limited geographic areas. Palmore itself makes this limitation clear.
            The quoted passage distinguishes the congressional powers at issue in Palmore from those
            in which the Art. III command of an independent Judiciary must be honored: where "laws
            of national applicability and affairs of national concern are at stake." 411 U.S., at
            408, 93 S.Ct., at 1681. Laws respecting bankruptcy, like most laws enacted pursuant to
            the national powers cataloged in Art. I, &amp;#167; 8, are clearly laws of national
            applicability and affairs of national concern. Thus our reference in Palmore to
            "specialized areas having particularized needs" referred only to geographic areas, such
            as the District of Columbia or territories outside the States of the Federal Union. In
            light of the clear commands of Art. III, nothing held or said in Palmore can be taken to
            mean that in every area in which Congress may legislate, it may also create non-Art. III
            courts with Art. III powers.</p>


         <span class="num">55</span>
         <p>In sum, Art. III bars Congress from establishing legislative courts to exercise
            jurisdiction over all matters related to those arising under the bankruptcy laws. The
            establishment of such courts does not fall within any of the historically recognized
            situations in which the general principle of independent adjudication commanded by Art.
            III does not apply. Nor can we discern any persuasive reason, in logic, history, or the
            Constitution, why the bankruptcy courts here established lie beyond the reach of Art.

         <span class="num">56</span>
         <p>Appellants advance a second argument for upholding the constitutionality of the Act:
            that "viewed within the entire judicial framework set up by Congress," the bankruptcy
            court is merely an "adjunct" to the district court, and that the delegation of certain
            adjudicative functions to the bankruptcy court is accordingly consistent with the
            principle that the judicial power of the United States must be vested in Art. III
            courts. See Brief for United States 11-13, 37-45. As support for their argument,
            appellants rely principally upon Crowell v. Benson, <span class="citation">

            States 40-42. The question to which we turn, therefore, is whether the Act has retained
            "the essential attributes of the judicial power," Crowell v. Benson, supra, 285 U.S., at
            51, 52 S.Ct., at 292, in Art. III tribunals.<a class="footnote" href="#fn29"

         </p>


         <span class="num">57</span>
         <p>The essential premise underlying appellants' argument is that even where the
            Constitution denies Congress the power to establish legislative courts, Congress
            possesses the authority to assign certain factfinding functions to adjunct tribunals. It
            is, of course, true that while the power to adjudicate "private rights" must be vested
            in an Art. III court, see Part III, supra,</p>

            n. 7.</p>


         <span class="num">59</span>
         <p>The use of administrative agencies as adjuncts was first upheld in Crowell v. Benson,
            supra. The congressional scheme challenged in Crowell empowered an administrative
            agency, the United States Employees' Compensation Commission, to make initial factual
            determinations pursuant to a federal statute requiring employers to compensate their
            employees for work-related injuries occurring upon the navigable waters of the United
            States. The Court began its analysis by noting that the federal statute administered by
            the Compensation Commission provided for compensation of injured employees "irrespective
            of fault," and that the statute also prescribed a fixed and mandatory schedule of
            compensation. Id., 285 U.S., at 38, 52 S.Ct., at 287. The agency was thus left with the
            limited role of determining "questions of fact as to the circumstances, nature, extent
            and consequences of the injuries sustained by the employee for which compensation is to
            be made." Id., at 54, 52 S.Ct., at 293. The agency did not possess the power to enforce
            any of its compensation orders: On the contrary, every compensation order was appealable
            to the appropriate federal district court, which had the sole power to enforce it or set
            it aside, depending upon whether the court determined it to be "in accordance with law"
            and supported by evidence in the record. Id., at 44-45, 48, 52 S.Ct., at 289-290, 291.
            The Court found that in view of these limitations upon the Compensation Commission's
            functions and powers, its determinations were "closely analogous to findings of the
            amount of damages that are made, according to familiar practice, by commissioners or
            assessors." Id., at 54, 52 S.Ct., at 293. Observing that "there is no requirement that,
            in order to maintain the essential attributes of the judicial power, all determinations
            of fact in constitutional courts shall be made by judges," id., at 51, 52 S.Ct., at 292,
            the Court held that Art. III imposed no bar to the scheme enacted by Congress, id., at
            54, 52 S.Ct., at 293.</p>


         <span class="num">60</span>
         <p>Crowell involved the adjudication of congressionally created rights. But this Court has
            sustained the use of adjunct factfinders even in the adjudication of constitutional
            rights&amp;#8212; so long as those adjuncts were subject to sufficient control by an
            Art. III district court. In United States v. Raddatz, supra, the Court upheld the 1978
            Federal Magistrates Act, which permitted district court judges to refer certain pretrial
            motions, including suppression motions based on alleged violations of constitutional
            rights, to a magistrate for initial determination. The Court observed that the
            magistrate's proposed findings and recommendations were subject to de novo review by the
            district court, which was free to rehear the evidence or to call for additional
            evidence. Id., 447 U.S., at 676-677, 681-683, 100 S.Ct., at 2412-2413, 2415-2416.
            Moreover, it was noted that the magistrate considered motions only upon reference from
            the district court, and that the magistrates were appointed, and subject to removal, by
            the district court. Id., at 685, 100 S.Ct., at 2417 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring).<a
               class="footnote" href="#fn30" id="fn30_ref">30</a> In short, the ultimate
            decisionmaking authority respecting all pretrial motions clearly remained with the
            district court. Id., at 682, 100 S.Ct., at 2415. Under these circumstances, the Court
            held that the Act did not violate the constraints of Art. III. Id., at 683-684, 100
            S.Ct., at 2416.<a class="footnote" href="#fn31" id="fn31_ref">31</a> Together these
            cases establish two principles that aid us in determining the extent to which Congress
            may constitutionally vest traditionally judicial functions in non-Art. III officers.
            First, it is clear that when Congress creates a substantive federal right, it possesses
            substantial discretion to prescribe the manner in which that right may be
            adjudicated&amp;#8212;including the assignment to an adjunct of some functions
            historically performed by judges.<a class="footnote" href="#fn32" id="fn32_ref">32</a>
            Thus Crowell recognized that Art. III does not require "all determinations of fact [to]
            be made by judges," 285 U.S., at 51, 52 S.Ct., at 292; with respect to congressionally
            created rights, some factual determinations may be made by a specialized factfinding
            tribunal designed by Congress, without constitutional bar, id., at 54, 52 S.Ct., at 293.
            Second, the functions of the adjunct must be limited in such a way that "the essential
            attributes" of judicial power are retained in the Art. III court. Thus in upholding the
            adjunct scheme challenged in Crowell, the Court emphasized that "the reservation of full
            authority to the court to deal with matters of law provides for the appropriate exercise
            of the judicial function in this class of cases." Ibid. And in refusing to invalidate
            the Magistrates Act at issue in Raddatz, the Court stressed that under the congressional
            scheme " '[t]he authority and the responsibility&amp;#8212;to make an informed, final
            determination . . . remains with the judge,' " 447 U.S., at 682, 100 S.Ct., at 2415,
            quoting Mathews v. Weber, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/yve/mathews-v-weber/">
                  <span class="volume">423</span>
                  <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>

            </span>, 271, 96 S.Ct. 549, 554, 46 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976); the statute's delegation of
            power was therefore permissible, since "the ultimate decision is made by the district
            court," 447 U.S., at 683, 100 S.Ct., at 2416.</p>


         <span class="num">61</span>
         <p>These two principles assist us in evaluating the "adjunct" scheme presented in these
            cases. Appellants assume that Congress' power to create "adjuncts" to consider all cases
            related to those arising under Title 11 is as great as it was in the circumstances of
            Crowell. But while Crowell certainly endorsed the proposition that Congress possesses
            broad discretion to assign factfinding functions to an adjunct created to aid in the
            adjudication of congressionally created statutory rights, Crowell does not support the
            further proposition necessary to appellants' argument&amp;#8212;that Congress possesses
            the same degree of discretion in assigning traditionally judicial power to adjuncts
            engaged in the adjudication of rights not created by Congress. Indeed, the validity of
            this proposition was expressly denied in Crowell, when the Court rejected "the untenable
            assumption that the constitutional courts may be deprived in all cases of the
            determination of facts upon evidence even though a constitutional right may be
            involved," 285 U.S., at 60-61, 52 S.Ct., at 296 (emphasis added),<a class="footnote"
               href="#fn33" id="fn33_ref">33</a> and stated that</p>


         <span class="num">62</span>
         <p>"the essential independence of the exercise of the judicial power of the United States
            in the enforcement of constitutional rights requires that the Federal court should
            determine . . . an issue [of agency jurisdiction] upon its own record and the facts
            elicited before it." Id., at 64, 52 S.Ct., at 297 (emphasis added).<a class="footnote"
               href="#fn34" id="fn34_ref">34</a>
         </p>


         <span class="num">63</span>
         <p>Appellants' proposition was also implicitly rejected in Raddatz. Congress' assignment of
            adjunct functions under the Federal Magistrates Act was substantially narrower than
            under the statute challenged in Crowell. Yet the Court's scrutiny of the adjunct scheme
            in Raddatz &amp;#8212;which played a role in the adjudication of constitutional
            rights&amp;#8212;was far stricter than it had been in Crowell. Critical to the Court's
            decision to uphold the Magistrates Act was the fact that the ultimate decision was made
            by the district court. 447 U.S., at 683, 100 S.Ct., at 2416.</p>


         <span class="num">64</span>
         <p>Although Crowell and Raddatz do not explicitly distinguish between rights created by
            Congress and other rights, such a distinction underlies in part Crowell's and Raddatz'
            recognition of a critical difference between rights created by federal statute and
            rights recognized by the Constitution. Moreover, such a distinction seems to us to be
            necessary in light of the delicate accommodations required by the principle of
            separation of powers reflected in Art. III. The constitutional system of checks and
            balances is designed to guard against "encroachment or aggrandizement" by Congress at
            the expense of the other branches of government. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S., at 122, 96
            S.Ct., at 683. But when Congress creates a statutory right, it clearly has the
            discretion, in defining that right, to create presumptions, or assign burdens of proof,
            or prescribe remedies; it may also provide that persons seeking to vindicate that right
            must do so before particularized tribunals created to perform the specialized
            adjudicative tasks related to that right.<a class="footnote" href="#fn35" id="fn35_ref"
               >35</a> Such provisions do, in a sense, affect the exercise of judicial power, but
            they are also incidental to Congress' power to define the right that it has created. No
            comparable justification exists, however, when the right being adjudicated is not of
            congressional creation. In such a situation, substantial inroads into functions that
            have traditionally been performed by the Judiciary cannot be characterized merely as
            incidental extensions of Congress' power to define rights that it has created. Rather,
            such inroads suggest unwarranted encroachments upon the judicial power of the United
            States, which our Constitution reserves for Art. III courts.</p>


         <span class="num">65</span>
         <p>We hold that the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 carries the possibility of such an unwarranted
            encroachment. Many of the rights subject to adjudication by the Act's bankruptcy courts,
            like the rights implicated in Raddatz, are not of Congress' creation. Indeed, the cases
            before us, which center upon appellant Northern's claim for damages for breach of
            contract and misrepresentation, involve a right created by state law, a right
            independent of and antecedent to the reorganization petition that conferred jurisdiction
            upon the Bankruptcy Court.<a class="footnote" href="#fn36" id="fn36_ref">36</a>
            Accordingly, Congress' authority to control the manner in which that right is
            adjudicated, through assignment of historically judicial functions to a non-Art. III
            "adjunct," plainly must be deemed at a minimum. Yet it is equally plain that Congress
            has vested the "adjunct" bankruptcy judges with powers over Northern's state-created
            right that far exceed the powers that it has vested in administrative agencies that
            adjudicate only rights of Congress' own creation.</p>


         <span class="num">66</span>
         <p>Unlike the administrative scheme that we reviewed in Crowell, the Act vests all
            "essential attributes" of the judicial power of the United States in the "adjunct"
            bankruptcy court. First, the agency in Crowell made only specialized, narrowly confined
            factual determinations regarding a particularized area of law. In contrast, the
            subject-matter jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts encompasses not only traditional
            matters of bankruptcy, but also "all civil proceedings arising under title 11 or arising
            in or related to cases under title 11." 28 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1471(c) (1976 ed., Supp.IV)
            (emphasis added). Second, while the agency in Crowell engaged in statutorily channeled
            factfinding functions, the bankruptcy courts exercise "all of the jurisdiction"
            conferred by the Act on the district courts, &amp;#167; 1471(c) (emphasis added). Third,
            the agency in Crowell possessed only a limited power to issue compensation orders
            pursuant to specialized procedures, and its orders could be enforced only by order of
            the district court. By contrast, the bankruptcy courts exercise all ordinary powers of
            district courts, including the power to preside over jury trials, 28 U.S.C. &amp;#167;
            1480 (1976 ed., Supp.IV), the power to issue declaratory judgments, &amp;#167; 2201, the
            power to issue writs of habeas corpus, &amp;#167; 2256, and the power to issue any
            order, process, or judgment appropriate for the enforcement of the provisions of Title
            11, 11 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 105(a) (1976 ed., Supp.IV).<a class="footnote" href="#fn37"
               id="fn37_ref">37</a> Fourth, while orders issued by the agency in Crowell were to be
            set aside if "not supported by the evidence," the judgments of the bankruptcy courts are
            apparently subject to review only under the more deferential "clearly erroneous"
            standard. See n. 5, supra. Finally, the agency in Crowell was required by law to seek
            enforcement of its compensation orders in the district court. In contrast, the
            bankruptcy courts issue final judgments, which are binding and enforceable even in the
            absence of an appeal.<a class="footnote" href="#fn38" id="fn38_ref">38</a> In short, the
            "adjunct" bankruptcy courts created by the Act exercise jurisdiction behind the facade
            of a grant to the district courts, and are exercising powers far greater than those
            lodged in the adjuncts approved in either Crowell or Raddatz.<a class="footnote"
               href="#fn39" id="fn39_ref">39</a> We conclude that 28 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1471 (1976
            ed., Supp.IV), as added by &amp;#167; 241(a) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1978, has
            impermissibly removed most, if not all, of "the essential attributes of the judicial

         <p>Having concluded that the broad grant of jurisdiction to the bankruptcy courts contained
            in 28 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1471 (1976 ed., Supp.IV) is unconstitutional, we must now
            determine whether our holding should be applied retroactively to the effective date of
            the Act.<a class="footnote" href="#fn40" id="fn40_ref">40</a> Our decision in Chevron

            </span>, 92 S.Ct. 349, 30 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971), sets forth the three considerations
            recognized by our precedents as properly bearing upon the issue of retroactivity. They
            are, first, whether the holding in question "decid[ed] an issue of first impression
            whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed" by earlier cases, id., at 106, 92 S.Ct.,
            at 355; second, "whether retrospective operation will further or retard [the] operation"
            of the holding in question, id., at 107, 92 S.Ct., at 355; and third, whether
            retroactive application "could produce substantial inequitable results" in individual
            cases, ibid. In the present cases, all of these considerations militate against the
            retroactive application of our holding today. It is plain that Congress' broad grant of
            judicial power to non-Art. III bankruptcy judges presents an unprecedented question of
            interpretation of Art. III. It is equally plain that retroactive application would not
            further the operation of our holding, and would surely visit substantial injustice and
            hardship upon those litigants who relied upon the Act's vesting of jurisdiction in the
            bankruptcy courts. We hold, therefore, that our decision today shall apply only
               prospectively.<a class="footnote" href="#fn41" id="fn41_ref">41</a>

         <p>Were I to agree with the plurality that the question presented by these cases is
            "whether the assignment by Congress to bankruptcy judges of the jurisdiction granted in
            28 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1471 (1976 ed., Supp.IV) by &amp;#167; 241(a) of the Bankruptcy Act
            of 1978 violates Art. III of the Constitution," ante, at 52, I would with considerable
            reluctance embark on the duty of deciding this broad question. But appellee Marathon
            Pipe Line Co. has not been subjected to the full range of authority granted bankruptcy
            courts by &amp;#167; 1471. It was named as a defendant in a suit brought by appellant
            Northern Pipeline Construction Co. in a United States Bankruptcy Court. The suit sought
            damages for, inter alia, breaches of contract and warranty. Marathon moved to dismiss
            the action on the grounds that the Bankruptcy Act of 1978, which authorized the suit,
            violated Art. III of the Constitution insofar as it established bankruptcy judges whose
            tenure and salary protection do not conform to the requirements of Art. III.</p>


         <span class="num">72</span>
         <p>With the cases in this posture, Marathon has simply been named defendant in a lawsuit
            about a contract, a lawsuit initiated by appellant Northern after having previously
            filed a petition for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Act. Marathon may object to
            proceeding further with this lawsuit on the grounds that if it is to be resolved by an
            agency of the United States, it may be resolved only by an agency which exercises "[t]he
            judicial power of the United States" described by Art. III of the Constitution. But
            resolution of any objections it may make on this ground to the exercise of a different
            authority conferred on bankruptcy courts by the 1978 Act, see ante, at 54-55, should
            await the exercise of such authority.</p>

            its frequently arcane distinctions and confusing precedents, rigorous adherence to the
            principle that this Court should decide no more of a constitutional question than is

         <p>From the record before us, the lawsuit in which Marathon was named defendant seeks
            damages for breach of contract, misrepresentation, and other counts which are the stuff
            of the traditional actions at common law tried by the courts at Westminster in 1789.
            There is apparently no federal rule of decision provided for any of the issues in the
            lawsuit; the claims of Northern arise entirely under state law. No method of
            adjudication is hinted, other than the traditional common-law mode of judge and jury.
            The lawsuit is before the Bankruptcy Court only because the plaintiff has previously
            filed a petition for reorganization in that court.</p>

            proposition and three tidy exceptions, as the plurality believes, or whether instead
            they are but landmarks on a judicial "darkling plain" where ignorant armies have clashed
            by night, as JUSTICE WHITE apparently believes them to be. None of the cases has gone so
            far as to sanction the type of adjudication to which Marathon will be subjected against
            its will under the provisions of the 1978 Act. To whatever extent different powers

         <p>I am likewise of the opinion that the extent of review by Art. III courts provided on

            save the grant of authority to the latter under the rule espoused in Crowell v. Benson,

            domains of the law to which the parties' dispute may lead are to be resolved by the
            bankruptcy court in the first instance, with only traditional appellate review by Art.
            III courts apparently contemplated. Acting in this manner the bankruptcy court is not an
            "adjunct" of either the district court or the court of appeals.</p>


         <span class="num">78</span>
         <p>I would, therefore, hold so much of the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 as enables a Bankruptcy
            Court to entertain and decide Northern's lawsuit over Marathon's objection to be
            violative of Art. III of the United States Constitution. Because I agree with the
            plurality that this grant of authority is not readily severable from the remaining grant
            of authority to bankruptcy courts under &amp;#167; 1471, see ante, at 87-88, n. 40, I
            concur in the judgment. I also agree with the discussion in Part V of the plurality

         <span class="num">80</span>
         <p>I join Justice WHITE's dissenting opinion, but I write separately to emphasize that,
            notwithstanding the plurality opinion, the Court does not hold today that Congress'
            broad grant of jurisdiction to the new bankruptcy courts is generally inconsistent with
            Art. III of the Constitution. Rather, the Court's holding is limited to the proposition
            stated by Justice REHNQUIST in his concurrence in the judgment&amp;#8212;that a
            "traditional" state common-law action, not made subject to a federal rule of decision,
            and related only peripherally to an adjudication of bankruptcy under federal law, must,
            absent the consent of the litigants, be heard by an "Art. III court" if it is to be
            heard by any court or agency of the United States. This limited holding, of course, does
            not suggest that there is something inherently unconstitutional about the new bankruptcy
            courts; nor does it preclude such courts from adjudicating all but a relatively narrow
            category of claims "arising under" or "arising in or related to cases under" the
            Bankruptcy Act.</p>


         <span class="num">81</span>
         <p>It will not be necessary for Congress, in order to meet the requirements of the Court's
            holding, to undertake a radical restructuring of the present system of bankruptcy
            adjudication. The problems arising from today's judgment can be resolved simply by
            providing that ancillary common-law actions, such as the one involved in these cases, be
            routed to the United States district court of which the bankruptcy court is an
            adjunct.</p>

         <span class="num">83</span>
         <p>Article III, &amp;#167; 1, of the Constitution is straightforward and uncomplicated on
            its face: "The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme
            Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and
            establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices
            during good Behaviour, and shall at stated Times, receive for their Services, a
            Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office."</p>


         <span class="num">84</span>
         <p>Any reader could easily take this provision to mean that although Congress was free to
            establish such lower courts as it saw fit, any court that it did establish would be an
            "inferior" court exercising "judicial Power of the United States" and so must be manned
            by judges possessing both life tenure and a guaranteed minimal income. This would be an
            eminently sensible reading and one that, as the plurality shows, is well founded in both
            the documentary sources and the political doctrine of separation of powers that stands
            behind much of our constitutional structure. Ante, at 57-60.</p>


         <span class="num">85</span>
         <p>If this simple reading were correct and we were free to disregard 150 years of history,
            these would be easy cases and the plurality opinion could end with its observation that
            "[i]t is undisputed that the bankruptcy judges whose offices were created by the
            Bankruptcy Act of 1978 do not enjoy the protections constitutionally afforded to Art.
            III judges." Ante, at 60. The fact that the plurality must go on to deal with what has
            been characterized as one of the most confusing and controversial areas of
            constitutional law<a class="footnote" href="#fn1-1" id="fn1-1_ref">1</a> itself
            indicates the gross oversimplification implicit in the plurality's claim that "our
            Constitution unambiguously enunciates a fundamental principle&amp;#8212;that the
            'judicial Power of the United States' must be reposed in an independent Judiciary [and]
            provides clear institutional protections for that independence." Ibid. While this is
            fine rhetoric, analytically it serves only to put a distracting and superficial gloss on
            a difficult question.</p>


         <span class="num">86</span>
         <p>That question is what limits Art. III places on Congress' ability to create adjudicative
            institutions designed to carry out federal policy established pursuant to the
            substantive authority given Congress elsewhere in the Constitution. Whether fortunate or
            unfortunate, at this point in the history of constitutional law that question can no
            longer be answered by looking only to the constitutional text. This Court's cases
            construing that text must also be considered. In its attempt to pigeonhole these cases,
            the plurality does violence to their meaning and creates an artificial structure that
            itself lacks coherence.</p>


         <span class="num">87</span>
         <p>* There are, I believe, two separate grounds for today's decision. First, non-Art. III
            judges, regardless of whether they are labeled "adjuncts" to Art. III courts or "Art. I
            judges," may consider only controversies arising out of federal law. Because the
            immediate controversy in these cases&amp;#8212;Northern Pipeline's claim against
            Marathon&amp;#8212;arises out of state law, it may only be adjudicated, within the
            federal system, by an Art. III court.<a class="footnote" href="#fn2-1" id="fn2-1_ref"
               >2</a> Second, regardless of the source of law that governs the controversy, Congress
            is prohibited by Art. III from establishing Art. I courts, with three narrow exceptions.
            Adjudication of bankruptcy proceedings does not fall within any of these exceptions. I
            shall deal with the first of these contentions in this section.</p>


         <span class="num">88</span>
         <p>The plurality concedes that Congress may provide for initial adjudications by Art. I
            courts or administrative judges of all rights and duties arising under otherwise valid
            federal laws. Ante, at 80. There is no apparent reason why this principle should not
            extend to matters arising in federal bankruptcy proceedings. The plurality attempts to
            escape the reach of prior decisions by contending that the bankrupt's claim against
            Marathon arose under state law. Non-Article III judges, in its view, cannot be vested
            with authority to adjudicate such issues. It then proceeds to strike down 28 U.S.C.
            &amp;#167; 1471 (1976 ed., Supp.IV) on this ground. For several reasons, the Court's
            judgment is unsupportable.</p>


         <span class="num">89</span>
         <p>First, clearly this ground alone cannot support the Court's invalidation of &amp;#167;
            1471 on its face. The plurality concedes that in adjudications and discharges in
            bankruptcy, "the restructuring of debtor-creditor relations, which is at the core of the
            federal bankruptcy power," ante, at 71, and "the manner in which the rights of debtors
            and creditors are adjusted," ante, at 84, n. 36, are matters of federal law. Under the
            plurality's own interpretation of the cases, therefore, these matters could be heard and
            decided by Art. I judges. But because the bankruptcy judge is also given authority to
            hear a case like that of appellant Northern against Marathon, which the Court says is
            founded on state law, the Court holds that the section must be stricken down on its
            face. This is a grossly unwarranted emasculation of the scheme Congress has adopted.
            Even if the Court is correct that such a state-law claim cannot be heard by a bankruptcy
            judge, there is no basis for doing more than declaring the section unconstitutional as
            applied to the claim against Marathon, leaving the section otherwise intact. In that
            event, cases such as these would have to be heard by Art. III judges or by state
            courts&amp;#8212;unless the defendant consents to suit before the bankruptcy
            judge&amp;#8212;just as they were before the 1978 Act was adopted. But this would remove
            from the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy judge only a tiny fraction of the cases he is
            now empowered to adjudicate and would not otherwise limit his jurisdiction.<a

         <span class="num">90</span>
         <p>Second, the distinction between claims based on state law and those based on federal law
            disregards the real character of bankruptcy proceedings. The routine in ordinary
            bankruptcy cases now, as it was before 1978, is to stay actions against the bankrupt,
            collect the bankrupt's assets, require creditors to file claims or be forever barred,
            allow or disallow claims that are filed, adjudicate preferences and fraudulent
            transfers, and make pro rata distributions to creditors, who will be barred by the
            discharge from taking further actions against the bankrupt. The crucial point to be made
            is that in the ordinary bankruptcy proceeding the great bulk of creditor claims are
            claims that have accrued under state law prior to bankruptcy&amp;#8212;claims for goods
            sold, wages, rent, utilities, and the like. "[T]he word debt as used by the Act is not
            confined to its technical common law meaning but . . . extends to liabilities arising
            out of breach of contract . . . to torts . . . and to taxes owing to the United States
            or state or local governments." 1 W. Collier, Bankruptcy &amp;#182; 1.14, p. 88 (14th
            ed. 1976). Every such claim must be filed and its validity is subject to adjudication by
            the bankruptcy court. The existence and validity of such claims recurringly depend on
            state law. Hence, the bankruptcy judge is constantly enmeshed in state-law issues.</p>


         <span class="num">91</span>
         <p>The new aspect of the Bankruptcy Act of 1978, in this regard, therefore, is not the
            extension of federal jurisdiction to state law claims, but its extension to particular
            kinds of state-law claims, such as contract cases against third parties or disputes
            involving property in the possession of a third person.<a class="footnote" href="#fn4-1"
               id="fn4-1_ref">4</a> Prior to 1978, a claim of a bankrupt against a third party, such
            as the claim against Marathon in this case, was not within the jurisdiction of the
            bankruptcy judge. The old limits were based, of course, on the restrictions implicit
            within the concept of in rem jurisdiction; the new extension is based on the concept of
            in personam jurisdiction. "The bankruptcy court is given in personam jurisdiction as
            well as in rem jurisdiction to handle everything that arises in a bankruptcy case."
            H.R.Rep.No. 95-595, p. 445 (1977), U.S.Code Cong. &amp;amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 6400.
            The difference between the new and old Acts, therefore, is not to be found in a
            distinction between state-law and federal-law matters; rather, it is in a distinction
            between in rem and in personam jurisdiction. The majority at no place explains why this
            distinction should have constitutional implications.</p>


         <span class="num">92</span>
         <p>Third, all that can be left of the majority's argument in this regard is that state-law
            claims adjudicated within the federal system must be heard in the first instance by Art.
            III judges. I shall argue below that any such attempt to distinguish Art. I from Art.
            III courts by the character of the controversies they may adjudicate fundamentally
            misunderstands the historical and constitutional significance of Art. I courts.
            Initially, however, the majority's proposal seems to turn the separation-of-powers
            doctrine, upon which the majority relies, on its head: Since state-law claims would
            ordinarily not be heard by Art. III judges&amp;#8212;i.e., they would be heard by state
            judges&amp;#8212;one would think that there is little danger of a diminution of, or
            intrusion upon, the power of Art. III courts, when such claims are assigned to a
            non-Art. III court. The plurality misses this obvious point because it concentrates on
            explaining how it is that federally created rights can ever be adjudicated in Art. I
            courts a far more difficult problem under the separation-of-powers doctrine. The
            plurality fumbles when it assumes that the rationale it develops to deal with the latter
            problem must also govern the former problem. In fact, the two are simply unrelated and
            the majority never really explains the separation-of-powers problem that would be
            created by assigning state law questions to legislative courts or to adjuncts of Art.
            III courts.</p>


         <span class="num">93</span>
         <p>One need not contemplate the intricacies of the separation-of-powers doctrine, however,
            to realize that the majority's position on adjudication of state-law claims is based on
            an abstract theory that has little to do with the reality of bankruptcy proceedings.
            Even prior to the present Act, bankruptcy cases were generally referred to bankruptcy
            judges, previously called referees. Bkrtcy.Rule 102(a). Title 11 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 66
            described the jurisdiction of the referees. Their powers included the authority to</p>


         <span class="num">94</span>
         <p>"consider all petitions referred to them and make the adjudications or dismiss the
            petitions . . . grant, deny or revoke discharges, determine the dischargeability of
            debts, and render judgments thereon [and] perform such of the duties as are by this
            title conferred on courts of bankruptcy, including those incidental to ancillary
            jurisdiction, and as shall be prescribed by rules or orders of the courts of bankruptcy
            of their respective districts, except as herein otherwise provided." The bankruptcy
            judge possessed "complete jurisdiction of the proceedings." 1 W. Collier, Bankruptcy
            &amp;#182; 1.09, p. 65 (14th ed. 1976). The referee would initially hear and decide
            practically all matters arising in the proceedings, including the allowance and
            disallowance of the claims of creditors.<a class="footnote" href="#fn5-1" id="fn5-1_ref"
               >5</a> If a claim was disallowed by the bankruptcy judge and the decision was not
            reversed on appeal, the creditor was forever barred from further action against the
            bankrupt. As pointed out above, all of these matters could and usually did involve
            state-law issues. Initial adjudication of state-law issues by non-Art. III judges is,
            then, hardly a new aspect of the 1978 Act.</p>


         <span class="num">95</span>
         <p>Furthermore, I take it that the Court does not condemn as inconsistent with Art. III the
            assignment of these functions&amp;#8212;i.e., those within the summary jurisdiction of
            the old bankruptcy courts to a non-Art. III judge, since, as the plurality says, they
            lie at the core of the federal bankruptcy power. Ante, at 71. They also happen to be
            functions that have been performed by referees or bankruptcy judges for a very long time
            and without constitutional objection. Indeed, we approved the authority of the referee
            to allow or disallow claims in Katchen v. Landy, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/xRd/katchen-v-landy/">
                  <span class="volume">382</span>
                  <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
                  <span class="page">323</span>
               </a>
            </span>, 86 S.Ct. 467, 15 L.Ed.2d 391 (1966). There, the referee held that a creditor
            had received a preference and that his claim could therefore not be allowed. We agreed
            that the referee had the authority not only to adjudicate the existence of the
            preference, but also to order that the preference be disgorged. We also recognized that
            the referee could adjudicate counterclaims against a creditor who files his claim
            against the estate. The 1973 Bankruptcy Rules make similar provision. See Rule 306(c),
            Rule 701, and Advisory Committee Note to Rule 701, 11 U.S.C., p. 1340. Hence, if
            Marathon had filed a claim against the bankrupt in this case, the trustee could have
            filed and the bankruptcy judge could have adjudicated a counterclaim seeking the relief
            that is involved in these cases.</p>


         <span class="num">96</span>
         <p>Of course, all such adjudications by a bankruptcy judge or referee were subject to
            review in the district court, on the record. See 11 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 67(c). Bankruptcy
            Rule 810, transmitted to Congress by this Court, provided that the district court "shall
            accept the referee's findings of fact unless they are clearly-erroneous." As the
            plurality recognizes, ante, at 55, the 1978 Act provides for appellate review in Art.
            III courts and presumably under the same "clearly erroneous standard." In other words,
            under both the old and new Acts, initial determinations of state-law questions were to
            be made by non-Art. III judges, subject to review by Art. III judges. Why the
            differences in the provisions for appeal in the two Acts are of unconstitutional
            dimension remains entirely unclear.</p>


         <span class="num">97</span>
         <p>In theory and fact, therefore, I can find no basis for that part of the majority's
            argument that rests on the state-law character of the claim involved here. Even if,
            prior to 1978, the referee could not generally participate in cases aimed at collecting
            the assets of a bankrupt estate, he nevertheless repeatedly adjudicated issues
            controlled by state law. There is very little reason to strike down &amp;#167; 1471 on
            its face on the ground that it extends, in a comparatively minimal way, the referees'
            authority to deal with state-law questions. To do so is to lose all sense of
            proportion.</p>

         <p>II</p>

         <span class="num">98</span>
         <p>The plurality unpersuasively attempts to bolster its case for facial invalidity by
            asserting that the bankruptcy courts are now "exercising powers far greater than those
            lodged in the adjuncts approved in either Crowell or Raddatz." Ante, at 86. In support
            of this proposition it makes five arguments in addition to the "state-law" issue.
            Preliminarily, I see no basis for according standing to Marathon to raise any of these
            additional points. The state-law objection applies to the Marathon case. Only that
            objection should now be adjudicated.<a class="footnote" href="#fn6-1" id="fn6-1_ref"
               >6</a>
         </p>


         <span class="num">99</span>
         <p>I also believe that the major premise of the plurality's argument is wholly unsupported:
            There is no explanation of why Crowell v. Benson, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/whh/crowell-v-benson/">
                  <span class="volume">285</span>
                  <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>

               </a>
            </span>, 52 S.Ct. 285, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932), and United States v. Raddatz, <span
               class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/yMZ/united-states-v-raddatz/">
                  <span class="volume">447</span>
                  <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>

               </a>
            </span>, 100 S.Ct. 2406, 65 L.Ed.2d 424 (1980), define the outer limits of
            constitutional authority. Much more relevant to today's decision are, first, the
            practice in bankruptcy prior to 1978, which neither the majority nor any authoritative
            case has questioned, and, second, the practice of today's administrative agencies.
            Considered from this perspective, all of the plurality's arguments are unsupportable
            abstractions, divorced from the realities of modern practice.</p>


         <span class="num">100</span>
         <p>The first three arguments offered by the plurality, ante, at 85, focus on the narrowly
            defined task and authority of the agency considered in Crowell: The agency made only
            "specialized, narrowly confined factual determinations" and could issue only a narrow
            class of orders. Regardless of whether this was true of the Compensation Board at issue
            in Crowell, it certainly was not true of the old bankruptcy courts, nor does it even
            vaguely resemble current administrative practice. As I have already said, general
            references to bankruptcy judges, which was the usual practice prior to 1978, permitted
            bankruptcy judges to perform almost all of the functions of a bankruptcy court. Referees
            or bankruptcy judges not only exercised summary jurisdiction but could also conduct
            adversary proceedings to</p>


         <span class="num">101</span>
         <p>"(1) recover money or property . . . . (2) determine the validity, priority, or extent
            of a lien or other interest in property, (3) sell property free of a lien or other
            interest for which the holder can be compelled to make a money satisfaction, (4) object
            to or revoke a discharge, (5) obtain an injunction, (6) obtain relief from a stay . . .
            (7) determine the dischargeability of a debt." Bkrtcy.Rule 701.</p>


         <span class="num">102</span>
         <p>Although there were some exceptions to the referees' authority, which have been removed
            by the 1978 Act, the additions to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy judges were of
            marginal significance when examined in the light of the overall functions of those
            judges before and after 1978. In my view, those changes are not sufficient to work a
            qualitative change in the character of the bankruptcy judge.</p>


         <span class="num">103</span>
         <p>The plurality's fourth argument fails to point to any difference between the new and old
            Bankruptcy Acts. While the administrative orders in Crowell may have been set aside by a
            court if "not supported by the evidence," under both the new and old Acts at issue here,
            orders of the bankruptcy judge are reviewed under the "clearly-erroneous standard." See
            Bkrtcy.Rule 810. Indeed, judicial review of the orders of bankruptcy judges is more
            stringent than that of many modern administrative agencies. Generally courts are not
            free to set aside the findings of administrative agencies, if supported by substantial
            evidence. But more importantly, courts are also admonished to give substantial deference
            to the agency's interpretation of the statute it is enforcing. No such deference is
            required with respect to decisions on the law made by bankruptcy judges.</p>


         <span class="num">104</span>
         <p>Finally, the plurality suggests that, unlike the agency considered in Crowell, the
            orders of a post-1978 bankruptcy judge are final and binding even though not appealed.
            Ante, at 85-86. To attribute any constitutional significance to this, unless the
            plurality intends to throw into question a large body of administrative law, is strange.
            More directly, this simply does not represent any change in bankruptcy practice. It was
            hornbook law prior to 1978 that the authorized judgments and orders of referees,
            including turnover orders, were final and binding and res judicata unless appealed and
            overturned:</p>


         <span class="num">105</span>
         <p>"The practice before the referee should not differ from that before the judge of the
            court of bankruptcy and, apart from direct review within the limitation of &amp;#167;
            39(c), the orders of the referee are entitled to the same presumption of validity,
            conclusiveness and recognition in the court of bankruptcy or other courts." 1 W.
            Collier, Bankruptcy &amp;#182; 1.09, pp. 65-66 (14th ed. 1976).</p>


         <span class="num">106</span>
         <p>Even if there are specific powers now vested in bankruptcy judges that should be
            performed by Art. III judges, the great bulk of their functions are unexceptionable and
            should be left intact. Whatever is invalid should be declared to be such; the rest of
            the 1978 Act should be left alone. I can account for the majority's inexplicably heavy
            hand in this case only by assuming that the Court has once again lost its conceptual
            bearings when confronted with the difficult problem of the nature and role of Art. I
            courts. To that question I now turn.</p>

         <p>III</p>
         <p>A.</p>

         <span class="num">107</span>
         <p>The plurality contends that the precedents upholding Art. I courts can be reduced to
            three categories. First, there are territorial courts, which need not satisfy Art. III
            constraints because "the Framers intended that as to certain geographical areas . . .
            Congress was to exercise the general powers of government."<a class="footnote"
               href="#fn7-1" id="fn7-1_ref">7</a> Ante, at 64. Second, there are courts martial,
            which are exempt from Art. III limits because of a constitutional grant of power that
            has been "historically understood as giving the political Branches of Government
            extraordinary control over the precise subject matter at issue." Ante, at 66. Finally,
            there are those legislative courts and administrative agencies that adjudicate cases
            involving public rights&amp;#8212;controversies between the Government and private
            parties&amp;#8212;which are not covered by Art. III because the controversy could have
            been resolved by the executive alone without judicial review. See ante, at 68. Despite
            the plurality's attempt to cabin the domain of Art. I courts, it is quite unrealistic to
            consider these to be only three "narrow," ante, at 64, limitations on or exceptions to
            the reach of Art. III. In fact, the plurality itself breaks the mold in its discussion
            of "adjuncts" in Part IV, when it announces that "when Congress creates a substantive
            federal right, it possesses substantial discretion to prescribe the manner in which that
            right may be adjudicated." Ante, at 80. Ajudications of federal rights may, according to
            the plurality, be committed to administrative agencies, as long as provision is made for
            judicial review.</p>


         <span class="num">108</span>
         <p>The first principle introduced by the plurality is geographical: Art. I courts
            presumably are not permitted within the States.<a class="footnote" href="#fn8-1"
               id="fn8-1_ref">8</a> The problem, of course, is that both of the other exceptions
            recognize that Art. I courts can indeed operate within the States. The second category
            relies upon a new principle: Art. I courts are permissible in areas in which the
            Constitution grants Congress "extraordinary control over the precise subject matter."
            Ante, at 66. Preliminarily, I do not know how we are to distinguish those areas in which
            Congress' control is "extraordinary" from those in which it is not. Congress' power over
            the Armed Forces is established in Art. I, &amp;#167; 8, cls. 13, 14. There is nothing
            in those Clauses that creates congressional authority different in kind from the
            authority granted to legislate with respect to bankruptcy. But more importantly, in its
            third category, and in its treatment of "adjuncts," the plurality itself recognizes that
            Congress can create Art. I courts in virtually all the areas in which Congress is
            authorized to act, regardless of the quality of the constitutional grant of authority.
            At the same time, territorial courts or the courts of the District of Columbia, which
            are Art. I courts, adjudicate private, just as much as public or federal, rights.</p>


         <span class="num">109</span>
         <p>Instead of telling us what it is Art. I courts can and cannot do, the plurality presents
            us with a list of Art. I courts. When we try to distinguish those courts from their Art.
            III counterparts, we find&amp;#8212;apart from the obvious lack of Art. III
            judges&amp;#8212;a series of nondistinctions. By the plurality's own admission, Art. I
            courts can operate throughout the country, they can adjudicate both private and public
            rights, and they can adjudicate matters arising from congressional actions in those

            category from the general "arising under" jurisdiction of Art. III courts.</p>

         <p>The plurality opinion has the appearance of limiting Art. I courts only because it fails
            to add together the sum of its parts. Rather than limiting each other, the principles
            relied upon complement each other; together they cover virtually the whole domain of
            possible areas of adjudication. Without a unifying principle, the plurality's argument
            reduces to the proposition that because bankruptcy courts are not sufficiently like any
            of these three exceptions, they may not be either Art. I courts or adjuncts to Art. III
            courts. But we need to know why bankruptcy courts cannot qualify as Art. I courts in
            their own right.</p>

         <p>The plurality opinion is not the first unsuccessful attempt to articulate a principled
            ground by which to distinguish Article I from Article III courts. The concept of a
            legislative, or Article I, court was introduced by an opinion authored by Chief Justice
            Marshall. Not only did he create the concept, but at the same time he started the
            theoretical controversy that has ever since surrounded the concept:</p>

         <p>"The Judges of the Superior Courts of Florida hold their offices for four years. These
            Courts, then, are not constitutional Courts, in which the judicial power conferred by
            the Constitution on the general government, can be deposited. They are incapable of
            receiving it. They are legislative Courts, created in virtue of the general right of
            sovereignty which exists in the government, or in virtue of that clause which enables
            Congress to make all needful rules and regulations, respecting the territory belonging
            to the United States. The jurisdiction with which they are invested, is not a part of
            that judicial power which is defined in the 3d article of the Constitution, but is

         <p>The proposition was simple enough: Constitutional courts exercise the judicial power
            described in Art. III of the Constitution; legislative courts do not and cannot.</p>


         <span class="num">114</span>
         <p>There were only two problems with this proposition. First, Canter itself involved a case
            in admiralty jurisdiction, which is specifically included within the "judicial power of
            the United States" delineated in Art. III. How, then, could the territorial court not be
            exercising Art. III judicial power? Second, and no less troubling, if the territorial
            courts could not exercise Art. III power, how could their decisions be subject to
            appellate review in Art. III courts, including this one, that can exercise only Art. III
            "judicial" power? Yet from early on this Court has exercised such appellate
            jurisdiction. Benner v. Porter, <span class="citation">

            analytic framework, however&amp;#8212;the search for a principled
            distinction&amp;#8212;has continued to burden the Court.</p>


         <span class="num">115</span>
         <p>The first major elaboration on the Canter principle was in Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken
            Land &amp;amp; Improvement Co., <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/rSb/murrays-lessee-v-hoboken-land-improvement-co/">

               </a>
            </span>, 15 L.Ed. 372 (1856). The plaintiff in that case argued that a proceeding
            against a customs collector for the collection of moneys claimed to be due to the United
            States was an exercise of "judicial power" and therefore had to be carried out by Art.
            III judges. The Court accepted this premise: "It must be admitted that, if the auditing
            of this account, and the ascertainment of its balance, and the issuing of this process,
            was an exercise of the judicial power of the United States, the proceeding was void; for
            the officers who performed these acts could exercise no part of that judicial power."
            Id., at 275. Having accepted this premise, the Court went on to delineate those matters
            which could be determined only by an Art. III court, i.e., those matters that fall
            within the nondelegable "judicial power" of the United States. The Court's response to
            this was twofold. First, it suggested that there are certain matters which are
            inherently "judicial": "[W]e do not consider congress can either withdraw from judicial
            cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common
            law, or in equity, or admiralty." Id., at 284. Second, it suggested that there is
            another class of issues that, depending upon the form in which Congress structures the
            decisionmaking process, may or may not fall within "the cognizance of the courts of the
            United States." Ibid. This latter category consisted of the so-called "public rights."
            Apparently, the idea was that Congress was free to structure the adjudication of "public
            rights" without regard to Art. III.</p>


         <span class="num">116</span>
         <p>Having accepted the plaintiff's premise, it is hard to see how the Court could have
            taken too seriously its first contention. The Court presented no examples of such issues
            that are judicial "by nature" and simply failed to acknowledge that Art. I courts
            already sanctioned by the Court&amp;#8212;e.g., territorial courts&amp;#8212;were
            deciding such issues all the time. The second point, however, contains implicitly a
            critical insight; one that if openly acknowledged would have undermined the entire
            structure. That insight follows from the Court's earlier recognition that the term
            "judicial act" is broad enough to encompass all administrative action involving inquiry
            into facts and the application of law to those facts. Id., at 280. If administrative
            action can be characterized as "judicial" in nature, then obviously the Court's
            subsequent attempt to distinguish administrative from judicial action on the basis of
            the manner in which Congress structures the decision cannot succeed. There need be no
            Art. III court involvement in any adjudication of a "public right," which the majority
            now interprets as any civil matter arising between the Federal Government and a citizen.
            In that area, whether an issue is to be decided by an Art. III court depends, finally,
            on congressional intent.</p>


         <span class="num">117</span>
         <p>Although Murray's Lessee implicitly undermined Chief Justice Marshall's suggestion that
            there is a difference in kind between the work of Art. I and that of Art. III courts, it
            did not contend that the Court must always defer to congressional desire in this regard.
            The Court considered the plaintiff's contention that removal of the issue from an Art.
            III court must be justified by "necessity." Although not entirely clear, the Court seems
            to have accepted this proposition: "[I]t seems to us that the just inference from the
            entire law is, that there was such a necessity for the warrant." Id., at 285.<a

         <span class="num">118</span>
         <p>The Court in Murray's Lessee was precisely right: Whether an issue can be decided by a
            non-Art. III court does not depend upon the judicial or nonjudicial character of the
            issue, but on the will of Congress and the reasons Congress offers for not using an Art.
            III court. This insight, however, was completely disavowed in the next major case to
            consider the distinction between Art. I and Art. III courts, Ex parte Bakelite Corp.,

            of Customs Appeals was a legislative court. The Court there directly embraced the
            principle also articulated in Murray's Lessee that Art. I courts may not consider any
            matter "which inherently or necessarily requires judicial determination," but only such
            matters as are "susceptible of legislative or executive determination." 279 U.S., at
            453, 49 S.Ct., at 414. It then went on effectively to bury the critical insight of
            Murray's Lessee, labeling as "fallacious" any argument that "assumes that whether a
            court is of one class or the other depends on the intention of Congress, whereas the
            true test lies in the power under which the court was created and in the jurisdiction
            conferred." 279 U.S., at 459, 49 S.Ct., at 416.<a class="footnote" href="#fn10-1"

         <p>The distinction between public and private rights as the principle delineating the

            administrative scheme for the determination, in the first instance, of maritime employee
            compensation claims. Although acknowledging the framework set out in Murray's Lessee and
            Ex parte Bakelite Corp., the Court specifically distinguished the case before it: "The
            present case does not fall within the categories just described but is one of private
            right, that is, of the liability of one individual to another under the law as
               defined."<a class="footnote" href="#fn11-1" id="fn11-1_ref">11</a> 285 U.S., at 51,
            52 S.Ct., at 292. Nevertheless, the Court approved of the use of an Art. I adjudication
            mechanism on the new theory that "there is no requirement that, in order to maintain the
            essential attributes of the judicial power, all determinations of fact in constitutional
            courts shall be made by judges." Ibid. Article I courts could deal not only with public
            rights, but also, to an extent, with private rights. The Court now established a
            distinction between questions of fact and law: "[T]he reservation of full authority to
            the court to deal with matters of law provides for the appropriate exercise of the
            judicial function in this class of cases."<a class="footnote" href="#fn12-1"

         <p>Whatever sense Crowell may have seemed to give to this subject was exceedingly
            short-lived. One year later, the Court returned to this subject, abandoning both the

            </span>, 69 S.Ct. 1173, 93 L.Ed. 1556 (1949), the Court upheld a statute giving federal
            district courts jurisdiction over suits between citizens of the District of Columbia and
            citizens of a State. A majority of the Court, however, rejected the plurality position
            that Congress had the authority to assign Art. I powers to Art. III courts, at least
            outside of the District of Columbia. Only Chief Justice Vinson in dissent reflected on
            the other side of this problem: whether Art. I courts could be assigned Art. III powers.
            He entirely disagreed with the conceptual basis for Williams and O'Donoghue, noting that
            to the extent that Art. I courts consider non-Art. III matters, appellate review by an
            Art. III court would be precluded. Or conversely, since appellate review is exercised by
            this Court over Art. I courts, Art. I courts must "exercise federal question
            jurisdiction." 337 U.S., at 643, 69 S.Ct., at 1208. Having gone this far, the Chief
            Justice was confronted with the obvious question of whether in fact "the distinction
            between constitutional and legislative courts is meaningless." Id., at 644, 69 S.Ct., at
            1208-09. Although suggesting that outside of the Territories or the District of Columbia

            most part the Chief Justice ended up relying on the good will of Congress: "[W]e cannot

            to be Art. III courts. Justice Harlan continued the process of intellectual repudiation
            begun by Chief Justice Vinson in Tidewater. First, it was clear to him that Chief
            Justice Marshall could not have meant what he said in Canter on the inability of Art. I
            courts to consider issues within the jurisdiction of Art. III courts: "Far from being
            'incapable of receiving' federal-question jurisdiction, the territorial courts have long
            exercised a jurisdiction commensurate in this regard with that of the regular federal
            courts and have been subjected to the appellate jurisdiction of this Court precisely
            because they do so." 370 U.S., at 545, n. 13, 82 S.Ct., at 1470, n. 13. Second,
            exceptions to the requirements of Art. III, he thought, have not been founded on any
            principled distinction between Art. I issues and Art. III issues; rather, a "confluence
            of practical considerations," id., at 547, 82 S.Ct., at 1471, accounts for this Court's
            sanctioning of Art. I courts:</p>


         <span class="num">125</span>
         <p>"The touchstone of decision in all these cases has been the need to exercise the
            jurisdiction then and there and for a transitory period. Whether constitutional
            limitations on the exercise of judicial power have been held inapplicable has depended
            on the particular local setting, the practical necessities, and the possible
            alternatives." Id., at 547-548, 82 S.Ct., at 1471-72.</p>


         <span class="num">126</span>
         <p>Finally, recognizing that there is frequently no way to distinguish Art. I and Art. III
            courts on the basis of the work they do, Justice Harlan suggested that the only way to
            tell them apart is to examine the "establishing legislation" to see if it complies with
            the requirements of Art. III. This, however, comes dangerously close to saying that Art.
            III courts are those with Art. III judges; Art. I courts are those without such judges.
            One hundred and fifty years of constitutional history, in other words, had led to a
            simple tautology.</p>

         <p>IV</p>

         <span class="num">127</span>
         <p>The complicated and contradictory history of the issue before us leads me to conclude
            that Chief Justice Vinson and Justice Harlan reached the correct conclusion: There is no
            difference in principle between the work that Congress may assign to an Art. I court and
            that which the Constitution assigns to Art. III courts. Unless we want to overrule a
            large number of our precedents upholding a variety of Art. I courts&amp;#8212;not to
            speak of those Art. I courts that go by the contemporary name of "administrative
            agencies"&amp;#8212;this conclusion is inevitable. It is too late to go back that far;
            too late to return to the simplicity of the principle pronounced in Art. III and
            defended so vigorously and persuasively by Hamilton in The Federalist Nos. 78-82.</p>


         <span class="num">128</span>
         <p>To say that the Court has failed to articulate a principle by which we can test the
            constitutionality of a putative Art. I court, or that there is no such abstract
            principle, is not to say that this Court must always defer to the legislative decision
            to create Art. I, rather than Art. III, courts. Article III is not to be read out of the
            Constitution; rather, it should be read as expressing one value that must be balanced
            against competing constitutional values and legislative responsibilities. This Court
            retains the final word on how that balance is to be struck.</p>


         <span class="num">129</span>
         <p>Despite the principled, although largely mistaken, rhetoric expanded by the Court in
            this area over the years, such a balancing approach stands behind many of the decisions
            holding Art. I courts. Justice Harlan suggested as much in Glidden, although he
            needlessly limited his consideration to the "temporary" courts that Congress has had to
            set up on a variety of occasions. In each of these instances, this Court has implicitly
            concluded that the legislative interest in creating an adjudicative institution of
            temporary duration outweighed the values furthered by a strict adherence to Art. III.

            method shown by experience to be essential in order to apply its standards to the
            thousands of cases involved." 285 U.S., at 54, 52 S.Ct., at 293. And even in Murray's
            Lessee, there was a discussion of the "necessity" of Congress' adopting an approach that
            avoided adjudication in an Art. III court. 18 How., at 285.</p>


         <span class="num">130</span>
         <p>This was precisely the approach taken to this problem in Palmore v. United States, <span
               class="citation">

            </span>, 93 S.Ct. 1670, 36 L.Ed.2d 342 (1973), which, contrary to the suggestion of the
            plurality, did not rest on any theory of territorial or geographical control. Ante, at
            75-76. Rather, it rested on an evaluation of the strength of the legislative interest in
            pursuing in this manner one of its constitutionally assigned
            responsibilities&amp;#8212;a responsibility not different in kind from numerous other
            legislative responsibilities. Thus, Palmore referred to the wide variety of Art. I
            courts, not just territorial courts. It is in this light that the critical statement of
            the case must be understood: "[T]he requirements of Art. . III, which are applicable
            where laws of national applicability and affairs of national concern are at stake, must
            in proper circumstances give way to accommodate plenary grants of power to Congress to
            legislate with respect to specialized areas having particularized needs and warranting
            distinctive treatment." 411 U.S., at 407-408, 93 S.Ct., at 1681-1682.</p>


         <span class="num">131</span>
         <p>I do not suggest that the Court should simply look to the strength of the legislative
            interest and ask itself if that interest is more compelling than the values furthered by
            Art. III. The inquiry should, rather, focus equally on those Art. III values and ask
            whether and to what extent the legislative scheme accommodates them or, conversely,
            substantially undermines them. The burden on Art. III values should then be measured
            against the values Congress hopes to serve through the use of Art. I courts.</p>


         <span class="num">132</span>
         <p>To be more concrete: Crowell, supra, suggests that the presence of appellate review by
            an Art. III court will go a long way toward insuring a proper separation of powers.
            Appellate review of the decisions of legislative courts, like appellate review of
            state-court decisions, provides a firm check on the ability of the political
            institutions of government to ignore or transgress constitutional limits on their own
            authority. Obviously, therefore, a scheme of Art. I courts that provides for appellate
            review by Art. III courts should be substantially less controversial than a legislative
            attempt entirely to avoid judicial review in a constitutional court.</p>


         <span class="num">133</span>
         <p>Similarly, as long as the proposed Art. I courts are designed to deal with issues likely
            to be of little interest to the political branches, there is less reason to fear that
            such courts represent a dangerous accumulation of power in one of the political branches
            of government. Chief Justice Vinson suggested as much when he stated that the Court
            should guard against any congressional attempt "to transfer jurisdiction . . . for the
            purpose of emasculating" constitutional courts. National Insurance Co. v. Tidewater Co.,
            337 U.S., at 644, 69 S.Ct., at 1208-1209.</p>

         <p>V</p>

         <span class="num">134</span>
         <p>I believe that the new bankruptcy courts established by the Bankruptcy Act of 1978, 28
            U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1471 (1976 ed., Supp.IV), satisfy this standard.</p>


         <span class="num">135</span>
         <p>First, ample provision is made for appellate review by Art. III courts. Appeals may in
            some circumstances be brought directly to the district courts. 28 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1334
            (1976 ed., Supp.IV). Decisions of the district courts are further appealable to the
            court of appeals. &amp;#167; 1293. In other circumstances, appeals go first to a panel
            of bankruptcy judges, &amp;#167; 1482, and then to the court of appeals. &amp;#167;
            1293. In still other circumstances&amp;#8212;when the parties agree&amp;#8212;appeals
            may go directly to the court of appeals. In sum, there is in every instance a right of
            appeal to at least one Art. III court. Had Congress decided to assign all bankruptcy
            matters to the state courts, a power it clearly possesses, no greater review in an Art.
            III court would exist. Although I do not suggest that this analogy means that Congress
            may establish an Art. I court wherever it could have chosen to rely upon the state
            courts, it does suggest that the critical function of judicial review is being met in a
            manner that the Constitution suggests is sufficient.</p>


         <span class="num">136</span>
         <p>Second, no one seriously argues that the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 represents an attempt by
            the political branches of government to aggrandize themselves at the expense of the
            third branch or an attempt to undermine the authority of constitutional courts in
            general. Indeed, the congressional perception of a lack of judicial interest in
            bankruptcy matters was one of the factors that led to the establishment of the
            bankruptcy courts: Congress feared that this lack of interest would lead to a failure by
            federal district courts to deal with bankruptcy matters in an expeditious manner.
            H.R.Rep.No. 95-595, p. 14 (1977). Bankruptcy matters are, for the most part, private
            adjudications of little political significance. Although some bankruptcies may indeed
            present politically controversial circumstances or issues, Congress has far more direct
            ways to involve itself in such matters than through some sort of subtle, or not so
            subtle, influence on bankruptcy judges. Furthermore, were such circumstances to arise,
            the Due Process Clause might very well require that the matter be considered by an Art.
            III judge: Bankruptcy proceedings remain, after all, subject to all of the strictures of
            that constitutional provision.<a class="footnote" href="#fn15-1" id="fn15-1_ref">15</a>
         </p>


         <span class="num">137</span>
         <p>Finally, I have no doubt that the ends that Congress sought to accomplish by creating a
            system of non-Art. III bankruptcy courts were at least as compelling as the ends found
            to be satisfactory in Palmore v. United States, <span class="citation">

            </span>, 83 S.Ct. 1670, 36 L.Ed.2d 342 (1973), or the ends that have traditionally
            justified the creation of legislative courts. The stresses placed upon the old
            bankruptcy system by the tremendous increase in bankruptcy cases were well documented
            and were clearly a matter to which Congress could respond.<a class="footnote"
               href="#fn16-1" id="fn16-1_ref">16</a> I do not believe it is possible to challenge
            Congress' further determination that it was necessary to create a specialized court to
            deal with bankruptcy matters. This was the nearly uniform conclusion of all those that
            testified before Congress on the question of reform of the bankruptcy system, as well as
            the conclusion of the Commission on Bankruptcy Laws established by Congress in 1970 to
            explore possible improvements in the system.<a class="footnote" href="#fn17-1"
               id="fn17-1_ref">17</a>
         </p>


         <span class="num">138</span>
         <p>The real question is not whether Congress was justified in establishing a specialized
            bankruptcy court, but rather whether it was justified in failing to create a
            specialized, Art. III bankruptcy court. My own view is that the very fact of extreme
            specialization may be enough, and certainly has been enough in the past,<a
               class="footnote" href="#fn18-1" id="fn18-1_ref">18</a> to justify the creation of a
            legislative court. Congress may legitimately consider the effect on the federal
            judiciary of the addition of several hundred specialized judges: We are, on the whole, a
            body of generalists.<a class="footnote" href="#fn19-1" id="fn19-1_ref">19</a> The
            addition of several hundred specialists may substantially change, whether for good or
            bad, the character of the federal bench. Moreover, Congress may have desired to maintain
            some flexibility in its possible future responses to the general problem of bankruptcy.
            There is no question that the existence of several hundred bankruptcy judges with life
            tenure would have severely limited Congress' future options. Furthermore, the number of
            bankruptcies may fluctuate, producing a substantially reduced need for bankruptcy
            judges. Congress may have thought that, in that event, a bankruptcy specialist should
            not as a general matter serve as a judge in the countless nonspecialized cases that come
            before the federal district courts. It would then face the prospect of large numbers of
            idle federal judges. Finally, Congress may have believed that the change from bankruptcy
            referees to Art. I judges was far less dramatic, and so less disruptive of the existing
            bankruptcy and constitutional court systems, than would be a change to Art. III
            judges.</p>


         <span class="num">139</span>
         <p>For all of these reasons, I would defer to the congressional judgment. Accordingly, I
            dissent.</p>

         <p> Bankruptcy referees were redesignated as "judges" in 1973. Bkrtcy.Rule 901(7). For
            purposes of clarity, however, we refer to all judges under the old Act as
            "referees."</p>


         <a class="footnote" href="#fn3_ref">3</a>
         <p> Although the Act initially vests this jurisdiction in district courts, 28 U.S.C.
            &amp;#167; 1471(a) (1976 ed., Supp.IV), it subsequently provides that "[t]he bankruptcy
            court for the district in which a case under title 11 is commenced shall exercise all of
            the jurisdiction conferred by this section on the district courts," &amp;#167; 1471(c)
            (1976 ed., Supp.IV) (emphasis added). Thus the ultimate repository of the Act's broad
            jurisdictional grant is the bankruptcy courts. See 1 W. Collier, Bankruptcy &amp;#182;
            3.01, pp. 3-37, 3-44 to 3-49 (15th ed. 1982).</p>


         <a class="footnote" href="#fn4_ref">4</a>
         <p> With respect to both personal jurisdiction and venue, the scope of the Act is also
            expansive. Although the Act does not in terms indicate the extent to which bankruptcy
            judges may exercise personal jurisdiction, it has been construed to allow the
            constitutional maximum. See, e.g., In re Whippany Paper Board Co., <span

               </a>
            </span>, 314-315 (Bkrtcy. NJ 1981). With two exceptions not relevant here, the venue of
            "a proceeding arising in or related to a case under title 11 [is] in the bankruptcy
            court in which such case is pending." 28 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1473(a) (1976 ed., Supp.IV).
            Furthermore, the Act permits parties to remove many kinds of actions to the bankruptcy
            court. Parties "may remove any claim or cause of action in a civil action, other than a
            proceeding before the United States Tax Court or a civil action by a Government unit to
            enforce such governmental unit's police or regulatory power." &amp;#167; 1478(a) (1976
            ed., Supp.IV). The bankruptcy court may, however, remand such actions "on any equitable
            ground"; the decision to remand or retain an action is unreviewable. &amp;#167;
            1478(b).</p>


         <a class="footnote" href="#fn5_ref">5</a>
         <p> Although no particular standard of review is specified in the Act, the parties in the
            present cases seem to agree that the appropriate one is the clearly-erroneous standard,
            employed in old Bankruptcy Rule 810 for review of findings of fact made by a referee.

         <p> These provisions serve other institutional values as well. The independence from
            political forces that they guarantee helps to promote public confidence in judicial
            determinations. See The Federalist No. 78 (A. Hamilton). The security that they provide
            to members of the Judicial Branch helps to attract well-qualified persons to the federal
            bench. Ibid. The guarantee of life tenure insulates the individual judge from improper
            influences not only by other branches but by colleagues as well, and thus promotes
            judicial individualism. See Kaufman, Chilling Judicial Independence, 88 Yale L.J. 681,

         <p> Further evidence of the Framers' concern for assuring the independence of the Judicial
            Branch may be found in the fact that the Constitutional Convention soundly defeated a
            proposal to allow the removal of judges by the Executive and Legislative Branches. See 2
            M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 428-429 (1911); P. Bator, P.

            the Federal System 7 (2d ed. 1973). Mr. Wilson, of Pennsylvania, commented that "[t]he
            Judges would be in a bad situation if made to depend on every gust of faction which
            might prevail in the two branches of our Govt." 2 Farrand, supra, at 429.</p>

         <p> It should be noted, however, that the House of Representatives expressed substantial
            doubts respecting the constitutionality of the provisions eventually included in the
            Act. The House Judiciary Committee and its Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional
            Rights gave lengthy consideration to the constitutional issues surrounding the conferral
            of broad powers upon the new bankruptcy courts. The Committee, the Subcommittee, and the
            House as a whole initially concluded that Art. III courts were constitutionally required
            for bankruptcy adjudications. See H.R. 8200, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977); Hearings on
            H.R. 31 and H.R. 32 before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the
            House Committee on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., 2081-2084 (1976); id., at

            28 De Paul L.Rev. 941, 945-949, 951 (1979). The Senate bankruptcy bill did not provide
            for life tenure or a guaranteed salary, instead adopting the concept of a bankruptcy
            court with similarly broad powers but as an "adjunct" to an Art. III court. S. 2266,
            95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978). The bill that was finally enacted, denying bankruptcy
            judges the tenure and compensation protections of Art. III, was the result of a series
            of last-minute conferences and compromises between the managers of both Houses. See

            Congress concluded that the bankruptcy courts should be established as independent

         <p> At one time, this Court suggested a rigid distinction between those subjects that could

            more recent cases clearly recognize that legislative courts may be granted jurisdiction
            over some cases and controversies to which the Art. III judicial power might also be

         <p> Justice WHITE's dissent finds particular significance in the fact that Congress could
            have assigned all bankruptcy matters to the state courts. Post, at 116. But, of course,
            virtually all matters that might be heard in Art. III courts could also be left by
            Congress to state courts. This fact is simply irrelevant to the question before us.
            Congress has no control over state-court judges; accordingly the principle of separation
            of powers is not threatened by leaving the adjudication of federal disputes to such
            judges. See Krattenmaker, Article III and Judicial Independence: Why the New Bankruptcy
            Courts are Unconstitutional, 70 Geo.L.J. 297, 304-305 (1981). The Framers chose to leave
            to Congress the precise role to be played by the lower federal courts in the
            administration of justice. See Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal
            System, supra, n. 11, at 11. But the Framers did not leave it to Congress to define the
            character of those courts&amp;#8212;they were to be independent of the political
            branches and presided over by judges with guaranteed salary and life tenure.</p>

         <p> The "unifying principle" that Justice WHITE's dissent finds lacking in all of these
            cases, see post, at 105, is to be found in the exceptional constitutional grants of
            power to Congress with respect to certain matters. Although the dissent is correct that
            these grants are not explicit in the language of the Constitution, they are nonetheless
            firmly established in our historical understanding of the constitutional structure. When
            these three exceptional grants are properly constrained, they do not threaten the
            Framers' vision of an independent Federal Judiciary. What clearly remains subject to
            Art. III are all private adjudications in federal courts within the
            States&amp;#8212;matters from their nature subject to "a suit at common law or in equity
            or admiralty"&amp;#8212;and all criminal matters, with the narrow exception of military
            crimes. There is no doubt that when the Framers assigned the "judicial Power" to an
            independent Art. III Branch, these matters lay at what they perceived to be the
            protected core of that power.</p>
         <p>Although the dissent recognizes that the Framers had something important in mind when
            they assigned the judicial power of the United States to Art. III courts, it concludes
            that our cases and subsequent practice have eroded this conception. Unable to find a
            satisfactory theme in our precedents for analyzing these cases, the dissent rejects all
            of them, as well as the historical understanding upon which they were based, in favor of
            an ad hoc balancing approach in which Congress can essentially determine for itself
            whether Art. III courts are required. See post, at 105-116. But even the dissent
            recognizes that the notion that Congress rather than the Constitution should determine
            whether there is a need for independent federal courts cannot be what the Framers had in
            mind. See post, at 113.</p>

            Congress to create territorial courts pursuant to the authority granted under Art. IV,
            &amp;#167; 3, cl. 2, and to create administrative tribunals to adjudicate rights in

         <p> Justice WHITE's suggested "limitations" on Congress' power to create Art. I courts are
            even more transparent. Justice WHITE's dissent suggests that Art. III "should be read as
            expressing one value that must be balanced against competing constitutional values and
            legislative responsibilities," and that the Court retains the final word on how the
            balance is</p>
         <p>to be struck. Post, at 113-114. The dissent would find the Art. III "value" accommodated
            where appellate review by Art. III courts is provided and where the Art. I courts are
            "designed to deal with issues likely to be of little interest to the political
            branches." Post, at 115. But the dissent's view that appellate review is sufficient to
            satisfy either the command or the purpose of Art. III is incorrect. See n. 39, infra.
            And the suggestion that we should consider whether the Art. I courts are designed to
            deal with issues likely to be of interest to the political Branches would undermine the
            validity of the adjudications performed by most of the administrative agencies, on which
            validity the dissent so heavily relies.</p>
         <p>In applying its ad hoc balancing approach to the facts of this case, the dissent rests
            on the justification that these courts differ from standard Art. III courts because of
            their "extreme specialization." As noted above, "extreme specialization" is hardly an
            accurate description of bankruptcy courts designed to adjudicate the entire range of
            federal and state controversies. See infra, at 84-85. Moreover, the special nature of
            bankruptcy adjudications is in no sense incompatible with performance of such functions
            in a tribunal afforded the protection of Art. III. As one witness pointed out to
            Congress:</p>
         <p>"Relevant to that question of need, it seems worth noting that Article III itself
            permits much flexibility; so long as tenure during good behavior is granted, much room
            exists as regards other conditions. Thus it would certainly be possible to create a
            special bankruptcy court under Article III and there is no reason why the judges of that
            court would have to be paid the same salary as district judges or any other existing
            judges. It would also be permissible to provide that when a judge of that court retired
            pursuant to statute, a vacancy for a new appointment would not automatically be created.
            And it would be entirely valid to specify that the judges of that court could not be
            assigned to sit, even temporarily, on the general district courts or courts of appeals."

         <a class="footnote" href="#fn29_ref">29</a>
         <p> Justice WHITE's dissent fails to distinguish between Congress' power to create adjuncts
            to Art. III courts, and Congress' power to create Art. I courts in limited
            circumstances. See post, at 103-104. Congress' power to create adjuncts and assign them
            limited adjudicatory functions is in no sense an "exception" to Art. III. Rather, such
            an assignment is consistent with Art. III, so long as "the essential attributes of the
            judicial power" are retained in the Art. III court, Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S., at 51,
            52 S.Ct., at 292, and so long as Congress' adjustment of the traditional manner of
            adjudication can be sufficiently linked to its legislative power to define substantive
            rights, see infra, at 83-84. Cf. Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupational Safety and Health
            Review Comm'n, 430 U.S., at 450, n. 7, 97 S.Ct., at 1266, n. 7.</p>


         <a class="footnote" href="#fn30_ref">30</a>
         <p> Thus in Raddatz there was no serious threat that the exercise of the judicial power
            would be subject to incursion by other branches. "[T]he only conceivable danger of a
            'threat' to the 'independence' of the magistrate comes from within, rather than without
            the judicial department." 447 U.S., at 685, 100 S.Ct., at 2417 (BLACKMUN, J.,

         <p> Appellants and Justice WHITE's dissent also rely on the broad powers exercised by the
            bankruptcy referees immediately before the Bankruptcy Act of 1978. See post, at 98-103.
            But those particular adjunct functions, which represent the culmination of years of
            gradual expansion of the power and authority of the bankruptcy referee, see 1 Collier,
            supra n. 3, &amp;#182; 1.02, have never been explicitly endorsed by this Court. In

            discussion of the Art. III issue. Moreover, when Katchen was decided the 1973 Bankruptcy
            Rules had not yet been adopted, and the district judge, after hearing the report of
            magistrate, was free to "modify it or . . . reject it in whole or in part or . . .
            receive further evidence or . . . recommit it with instructions." General Order in

            </span> (1939).</p>
         <p>We note, moreover, that the 1978 Act made at least three significant changes from the
            bankruptcy practice that immediately preceded it. First, of course, the jurisdiction of
            the bankruptcy courts was "substantially expanded" by the Act. H.R.Rep.No. 95-595, p. 13
            (1977). Before the Act the referee had no jurisdiction, except with consent, over
            controversies beyond those involving property in the actual or constructive possession
            of the court. 11 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 46(b) (repealed). See MacDonald v. Plymouth Trust
            Co., <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/wig/macdonald-v-plymouth-county-trust-co/">

            </span>, 266, 52 S.Ct. 505, 506, 76 L.Ed. 1093 (1932). It cannot be doubted that the new
            bankruptcy judges, unlike the referees, have jurisdiction far beyond that which can be
            even arguably characterized as merely incidental to the discharge in bankruptcy or a
            plan for reorganization. Second, the bankruptcy judges have broader powers than those
            exercised by the referees. See infra at 84-86;</p>
         <p>H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, supra, at 12, and nn. 63-68. Finally, and perhaps most
            significantly, the relationship between the district court and the bankruptcy court was
            changed under the 1978 Act. Before the Act, bankruptcy referees were "subordinate
            adjuncts of the district courts." Id., at 7, U.S.Code Cong. &amp;amp; Admin.News 1978,
            p. 5968. In contrast, the new bankruptcy courts are "independent of the United States
            district courts." Ibid.; 1 Collier, supra n. 3, &amp;#182; 1.03, p. 1-9. Before the Act,
            bankruptcy referees were appointed and removable only by the district court. 11 U.S.C.
            &amp;#167; 62 (repealed). And the district court retained control over the reference by
            his power to withdraw the case from the referee. Bkrptcy.Rule 102. Thus even at the
            trial stage, the parties had access to an independent judicial officer. Although
            Congress could still lower the salary of referees, they were not dependent on the
            political Branches of Government for their appointment. To paraphrase Justice BLACKMUN's
            observation in Raddatz, supra, the primary "danger of a 'threat' to the 'independence'
            of the [adjunct came] from within, rather than without, the judicial department." 447
            U.S., at 685, 100 S.Ct., at 2417 (concurring opinion).</p>


         <a class="footnote" href="#fn32_ref">32</a>
         <p> Contrary to Justice WHITE's suggestion, we do not concede that "Congress may provide
            for initial adjudications by Art. I courts or administrative judges of all rights and
            duties arising under otherwise valid federal laws." See post, at 94. Rather we simply
            reaffirm the holding of Crowell&amp;#8212;that Congress may assign to non-Art. III
            bodies some adjudicatory functions. Crowell itself spoke of "specialized" functions.
            These cases do not require us to specify further any limitations that may exist with
            respect to Congress' power to create adjuncts to assist in the adjudication of federal
            statutory rights.</p>


         <a class="footnote" href="#fn33_ref">33</a>
         <p> The Court in Crowell found that the requirement of de novo review as to certain facts
            was not "simply the question of due process in relation to notice and hearing," but was
            "rather a question of the appropriate maintenance of the Federal judicial power." 285
            U.S., at 56, 52 S.Ct., at 294. The dissent agreed that some factual findings cannot be
            made by adjuncts, on the ground that "under certain circumstances, the constitutional
            requirement of due process is a requirement of [Art. III] judicial process." Id., at 87,
            52 S.Ct., at 306 (Brandeis, J., dissenting).</p>

         <p> Crowell &amp;#167; precise holding, with respect to the review of "jurisdictional" and

         <p> Drawing the line between permissible extensions of legislative power and impermissible
            incursions into judicial power is a delicate undertaking, for the powers of the Judicial
            and Legislative Branches are often overlapping. As Justice Frankfurter noted in a
            similar context: "To be sure the content of the three authorities of government is not
            to be derived from an abstract analysis. The areas are partly interacting, not wholly

            substantive right, pursuant to one of its broad powers to make laws, Congress may have
            something to say about the proper manner of adjudicating that right.</p>


         <a class="footnote" href="#fn36_ref">36</a>
         <p> Of course, bankruptcy adjudications themselves, as well as the manner in which the
            rights of debtors and creditors are adjusted, are matters of federal law. Appellant
            Northern's state-law contract claim is now in federal court because of its relationship
            to Northern's reorganization petition. See n. 26, supra. But Congress has not purported
            to prescribe a rule of decision for the resolution of Northern's contractual claims.</p>

         <p> Appellants suggest that Crowell and Raddatz stand for the proposition that Art. III is
            satisfied so long as some degree of appellate review is provided. But that suggestion is
            directly contrary to the text of our Constitution: "The Judges, both of the supreme and
            inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall . . . receive
            [undiminished] Compensation." Art. III, &amp;#167; 1 (emphasis added). Our precedents
            make it clear that the constitutional requirements for the exercise of the judicial
            power must be met at all stages of adjudication, and not only on appeal, where the court
            is restricted to considerations of law, as well as the nature of the case as it has been
            shaped at the trial level. The Court responded to a similar suggestion in Crowell by
            stating that to accept such a regime,</p>
         <p>"would be to sap the judicial power as it exists under the Federal Constitution, and to
            establish a government of bureaucratic character alien to our system, wherever
            fundamental rights depend, as not infrequently they do depend, upon the facts, and

         <p>Justice WHITE's dissent views the function of the Third Branch as interpreting the
            Constitution in order to keep the other two Branches in check, and would accordingly
            find the purpose, if not the language, of Art. III satisfied where there is an appeal to
            an Art. III court. See post, at 115. But in the Framers' view, Art. III courts would do
            a great deal more than, in an abstract way, announce guidelines for the other two
            Branches. While "expounding" the Constitution was surely one vital function of the Art.
            III courts in the Framers' view, the tasks of those courts, for which independence was
            an important safeguard, included the mundane as well as the glamorous, matters of common
            law and statute as well as constitutional law, issues of fact as well as issues of law.
            As Hamilton noted, "it is not with a view to infractions of the Constitution only, that
            the independence of the judges may be an essential safeguard against the effects of
            occasional ill humors in the society." The Federalist No. 78, p. 488 (H. Lodge ed.
            1888). In order to promote the independence and improve the quality of federal judicial
            decisionmaking in all of these areas, the Framers created a system of independent
            federal courts. See The Federalist Nos. 78-82.</p>


         <a class="footnote" href="#fn40_ref">40</a>
         <p> It is clear that, at the least, the new bankruptcy judges cannot constitutionally be
            vested with jurisdiction to decide this state-law contract claim against Marathon. As
            part of a comprehensive restructuring of the bankruptcy laws, Congress has vested
            jurisdiction over this and all matters related to cases under Title 11 in a single
            non-Art. III court, and has done so pursuant to a single statutory grant of
            jurisdiction. In these circumstances we cannot conclude that if Congress were aware that
            the grant of jurisdiction could not constitutionally encompass this and similar claims,
            it would simply remove the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court over these matters,
            leaving the jurisdictional provision and adjudicatory structure intact with respect to
            other types of claims, and thus subject to Art. III constitutional challenge on a
            claim-by-claim basis. Indeed, we note that one of the express purposes of the Act was to
            ensure adjudication of all claims in a single forum and to avoid the delay and expense
            of jurisdictional disputes. See H.R.Rep.No. 95-595, pp. 43-48 (1977); S.Rep.No. 95-989,
            p. 17 (1978). Nor can we assume, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE suggests, post, at 92, that
            Congress' choice would be to have these cases "routed to the United States district
            court of which the bankruptcy court is an adjunct." We think that it is for Congress to
            determine the proper manner of restructuring the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 to conform to
            the requirements of Art. III in the way that will best effectuate the legislative
            purpose.</p>

         <p> The plurality attempts to justify its sweeping invalidation of &amp;#167; 1471, because
            of its inclusion of state-law claims, by suggesting that this statutory provision is
            nonseverable. Ante, at 87-88, n. 40. The Justices concurring in the judgment
            specifically adopt this argument as the reason for their decision to join the judgment
            of the Court. The basis for the conclusion of nonseverability, however, is nothing more
            than a presumption: "Congress has vested jurisdiction over this and all matters related
            to cases under Title 11 in a single non-Art. III court, and has done so pursuant to a
            single statutory grant of jurisdiction. In these circumstances, we cannot conclude that
            if Congress were aware that the grant of jurisdiction could not constitutionally
            encompass this and similar claims, it would simply remove the jurisdiction of the
            bankruptcy court over these matters." Ante, at 87, n. 40. Although it is possible, as a
            historical matter, to find cases of this Court supporting this presumption, see, e.g.,

         <p> The majority does not explain why the constitutional grant of power over the

            it does not seem to have any greater status than any of the other powers enumerated in

         <p> By stating that "of this necessity congress alone is the judge," 18 How., at 285, the
            Court added some serious ambiguity to the standard it applied. Because this statement
            ends the Court's analysis of the merits of the claim, it does not seem to mean that the
            Court will simply defer to congressional judgment. Rather, it appears to mean that the
            Court will review the legislative record to determine whether there appeared to Congress
            to be compelling reasons for not establishing an Art. III court.</p>


         <a class="footnote" href="#fn10-1_ref">10</a>
         <p> The Court did not, however, entirely follow this principle, for it stated elsewhere

            that Crowell's holding with respect to these "facts" turned more on the questions of law
