            White, and Justice Thomas join.</p>
         <p>This case involves a challenge to a rule promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior
            interpreting § 7 of the Endangered <span class="star-pagination">*558</span> Species Act
            of 1973 (ESA), 87 Stat. 892, as amended, 16 U. S. C. § 1536, in such fashion as to
            render it applicable only to actions within the United States or on the high seas. The
            preliminary issue, and the only one we reach, is whether respondents here, plaintiffs
            below, have standing to seek judicial review of the rule.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>The ESA, 87 Stat. 884, as amended, 16 U. S. C. § 1531 et seq., seeks to protest species
            of animals against threats to their continuing existence caused by man. See generally
            TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153 (1978). The ESA instructs the Secretary of the Interior to
            promulgate by regulation a list of those species which are either endangered or
            threatened under enumerated criteria, and to define the critical habitat of these
            species. 16 U. S. C. §§ 1533, 1536. Section 7(a)(2) of the Act then provides, in
            pertinent part:</p> "Each Federal agency shall, in consultation with and with the
         assistance of the Secretary [of the Interior], insure that any action authorized, funded,
         or carried out by such agency . . . is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of
         any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse
         modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary, after
         consultation as appropriate with affected States, to be critical." 16 U. S. C. §
         1536(a)(2). <p>In 1978, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine
            Fisheries Service (NMFS), on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary
            of Commerce respectively, promulgated a joint regulation stating that the obligations
            imposed by § 7(a)(2) extend to actions taken in foreign nations. 43 Fed. Reg. 874
            (1978). The next year, however, the Interior Department began to reexamine its position.
            Letter from Leo Kuliz, Solicitor, Department of the Interior, to Assistant Secretary,
            Fish and Wildlife and Parks, Aug. 8, 1979. A revised joint regulation, reinterpreting
               <span class="star-pagination">*559</span> § 7(a)(2) to require consultation only for
            actions taken in the United States or on the high seas, was proposed in 1983, 48 Fed.
            Reg. 29990, and promulgated in 1986, 51 Fed. Reg. 19926; 50 CFR 402.01 (1991).</p>
         <p>Shortly thereafter, respondents, organizations dedicated to wildlife conservation and
            other environmental causes, filed this action against the Secretary of the Interior,
            seeking a declaratory judgment that the new regulation is in error as to the geographic
            scope of § 7(a)(2) and an injunction requiring the Secretary to promulgate a new
            regulation restoring the initial interpretation. The District Court granted the
            Secretary's motion to dismiss for lack of standing. Defenders of Wildlife v. Hodel,
               <span class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">658</span>

               <span class="page">43</span>
            </span>, 47-48 (Minn. 1987). The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed by a
            divided vote. Defenders of Wildlife v. Hodel, 851 F. 2d 1035 (1988). On remand, the
            Secretary moved for summary judgment on the standing issue, and respondents moved for
            summary judgment on the merits. The District Court denied the Secretary's motion, on the
            ground that the Eighth Circuit had already determined the standing question in this
            case; it granted respondents' merits motion, and ordered the Secretary to publish a
            revised regulation. Defenders of Wildlife v.Hodel, <span class="citation no-link">

         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>While the Constitution of the United States divides all power conferred upon the Federal
            Government into "legislative Powers," Art. I, § 1, "[t]he executive Power," Art. II, §
            1, and "[t]he judicial Power," Art. III, § 1, it does not attempt to define those terms.
            To be sure, it limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to "Cases" and "Controversies,"
            but an executive inquiry can bear the name "case" (the Hoffa case) and a legislative
            dispute can bear the name "controversy" (the Smoot-Hawley controversy). Obviously, then,
            the Constitution's central mechanism of separation of powers depends <span
               class="star-pagination">*560</span> largely upon common understanding of what
            activities are appropriate to legislatures, to executives, and to courts. In The
           Federalist No. 48, Madison expressed the view that "[i]t is not infrequently a question
            of real nicety in legislative bodies whether the operation of a particular measure will,
            or will not, extend beyond the legislative sphere," whereas "the executive power [is]
            restrained within a narrower compass and .. . more simple in its nature," and "the
            judiciary [is] described by landmarks still less uncertain." The <ref type="treatise" num="48">Federalist</ref> No. 48, p.
            256 (Carey and McClellan eds. 1990). One of those landmarks, setting apart the "Cases"
            and "Controversies" that are of the justiciable sort referred to in Article III&#x97;"
            serv[ing] to identify those disputes which are appropriately resolved through the
            judicial process," Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 155 (1990)&#x97;is the doctrine
            of standing. Though some of its elements express merely prudential considerations that
            are part of judicial self-government, the core component of standing is an essential and
            unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III. See, e. g., Allen
            v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751 (1984).</p>
         <p>Over the years, our cases have established that the irreducible constitutional minimum
            of standing contains three elements. First, the plaintiff must have suffered an "injury
            in fact"&#x97;an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and
            particularized, see id., at 756; Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 508 (1975); Sierra Club
            v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 740-741, n. 16 (1972);<span class="sup">[1]</span> and (b)
            "actual or imminent, not `conjectural' or `hypothetical,' " Whitmore, supra, at 155
            (quoting Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 102 (1983)). Second, there must be a causal
            connection between the injury and the conduct complained of&#x97;the injury has to be
            "fairly. . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not . . . th[e]
            result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court." Simon v.
            Eastern Ky. Welfare <span class="star-pagination">*561</span> Rights Organization, 426
            U. S. 26, 41-42 (1976). Third, it must be "likely," as opposed to merely "speculative,"
            that the injury will be "redressed by a favorable decision." Id., at 38, 43.</p>
         <p>The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements.
            See FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 231 (1990); Warth, supra, at 508. Since they
            are not mere pleading requirements but rather an indispensable part of the plaintiff's
            case, each element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the
            plaintiff bears the burden of proof, i. e., with the manner and degree of evidence
            required at the successive stages of the litigation. See Lujan v. National Wildlife
            Federation, 497 U. S. 871, 883-889 (1990); Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood,
            441 U. S. 91, 114-115, and n. 31 (1979); Simon, supra, at 45, n. 25; Warth, supra, at
            527, and n. 6 (Brennan, J., dissenting). At the pleading stage, general factual
            allegations of injury resulting from the defendant's conduct may suffice, for on a
            motion to dismiss we "presum[e] that general allegations embrace those specific facts
            that are necessary to support the claim." National Wildlife Federation, supra, at 889.
            In response to a summary judgment motion, however, the plaintiff can no longer rest on
            such "mere allegations," but must "set forth" by affidavit or other evidence "specific
            facts," Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e), which for purposes of the summary judgment motion
            will be taken to be true. And at the final stage, those facts (if controverted) must be
            "supported adequately by the evidence adduced at trial." Gladstone, supra, at 115, n.
            31.</p>
         <p>When the suit is one challenging the legality of government action or inaction, the
            nature and extent of facts that must be averred (at the summary judgment stage) or
            proved (at the trial stage) in order to establish standing depends considerably upon
            whether the plaintiff is himself an object of the action (or forgone action) at issue.
            If he is, there is ordinarily little question that the action or inaction has <span
               class="star-pagination">*562</span> caused him injury, and that a judgment preventing
            or requiring the action will redress it. When, however, as in this case, a plaintiff's
            asserted injury arises from the government's allegedly unlawful regulation (or lack of
            regulation) of someone else, much more is needed. In that circumstance, causation and
            redressability ordinarily hinge on the response of the regulated (or regulable) third
            party to the government action or inaction&#x97;and perhaps on the response of others as
            well. The existence of one or more of the essential elements of standing "depends on the
            unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the courts and whose exercise
            of broad and legitimate discretion the courts cannot presume either to control or to
            predict," ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 615 (1989) (opinion of Kennedy, J.); see
            also Simon, supra, at 41-42; and it becomes the burden of the plaintiff to adduce facts
            showing that those choices have been or will be made in such manner as to produce
            causation and permit redress ability of injury. E. g., Warth, supra, at 505. Thus, when
            the plaintiff is not himself the object of the government action or inaction he
            challenges, standing is not precluded, but it is ordinarily "substantially more
            difficult" to establish. Allen, supra, at 758; Simon, supra, at 44-45; Warth, supra, at
            505.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>We think the Court of Appeals failed to apply the foregoing principles in denying the
            Secretary's motion for summary judgment. Respondents had not made the requisite
            demonstration of (at least) injury and redressability.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>Respondents' claim to injury is that the lack of consultation with respect to certain
            funded activities abroad "increas[es] the rate of extinction of endangered and
            threatened species." Complaint ¶ 5, App. 13. Of course, the desire to use or observe an
            animal species, even for purely esthetic purposes, is undeniably a cognizable interest
            for purpose of <span class="star-pagination">*563</span> standing. See, e. g., Sierra
            Club v. Morton, 405 U. S., at 734. "But the `injury in fact' test requires more than an
            injury to a cognizable interest. It requires that the party seeking review be himself
            among the injured." Id., at 734-735. To survive the Secretary's summary judgment motion,
            respondents had to submit affidavits or other evidence showing, through specific facts,
            not only that listed species were in fact being threatened by funded activities abroad,
            but also that one or more of respondents' members would thereby be "directly" affected
            apart from their "`special interest' in th[e] subject." Id., at 735, 739. See generally
            Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 343 (1977).</p>
         <p>With respect to this aspect of the case, the Court of Appeals focused on the affidavits
            of two Defenders' members&#x97; Joyce Kelly and Amy Skilbred. Ms. Kelly stated that she
            traveled to Egypt in 1986 and "observed the traditional habitat of the endangered nile
            crocodile there and intend[s] to do so again, and hope[s] to observe the crocodile
            directly," and that she "will suffer harm in fact as the result of [the] American . . .
            role . . . in overseeing the rehabilitation of the Aswan High Dam on the Nile . . . and
            [in] develop[ing] . . . Egypt's. . . Master Water Plan." App. 101. Ms. Skilbred averred
            that she traveled to Sri Lanka in 1981 and "observed th[e] habitat" of "endangered
            species such as the Asian elephant and the leopard" at what is now the site of the
            Mahaweli project funded by the Agency for International Development (AID), although she
            "was unable to see any of the endangered species"; "this development project," she
            continued, "will seriously reduce endangered, threatened, and endemic species habitat
            including areas that I visited . . . [, which] may severely shorten the future of these
            species"; that threat, she concluded, harmed her because she "intend[s] to return to Sri
            Lanka in the future and hope[s] to be more fortunate in spotting at least the endangered
            elephant and leopard." Id., at 145-146. When Ms. Skilbred was asked <span
               class="star-pagination">*564</span> at a subsequent deposition if and when she had
            any plans to return to Sri Lanka, she reiterated that "I intend to go back to Sri
            Lanka," but confessed that she had no current plans: "I don't know [when]. There is a
            civil war going on right now. I don't know. Not next year, I will say. In the future."
            Id., at 318.</p>
         <p>We shall assume for the sake of argument that these affidavits contain facts showing
            that certain agency-funded projects threaten listed species&#x97;though that is
            questionable. They plainly contain no facts, however, showing how damage to the species
            will produce "imminent" injury to Mses. Kelly and Skilbred. That the women "had visited"
            the areas of the projects before the projects commenced proves nothing. As we have said
            in a related context, "`Past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a
            present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief . . . if unaccompanied by any
            continuing, present adverse effects.' " Lyons, 461 U. S., at 102 (quoting O'Shea v.
            Littleton, 414 U. S. 488, 495-496 (1974)). And the affiants' profession of an "inten[t]"
            to return to the places they had visited before&#x97;where they will presumably, this
            time, be deprived of the opportunity to observe animals of the endangered
            species&#x97;is simply not enough. Such "some day" intentions&#x97;without any
            description of concrete plans, or indeed even any specification of when the some day
            will be&#x97;do not support a finding of the "actual or imminent" injury that our cases
            require. See supra, at 560.<span class="sup">[2]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*565</span> Besides relying upon the Kelly and Skilbred
            affidavits, respondents propose a series of novel standing theories. The first,
            inelegantly styled "ecosystem nexus," proposes that any person who uses any part of a
            "contiguous ecosystem" adversely affected by a funded activity has standing even if the
            activity is located a great distance away. This approach, as the Court of Appeals
            correctly observed, is inconsistent with our opinion in National Wildlife Federation,
            which held that a plaintiff claiming injury from environmental damage <span
               class="star-pagination">*566</span> must use the area affected by the challenged
            activity and not an area roughly "in the vicinity" of it. 497 U. S., at 887-889; see
            also Sierra Club, 405 U. S., at 735. It makes no difference that the general-purpose
            section of the ESA states that the Act was intended in part "to provide a means whereby
            the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be
            conserved," 16 U. S. C. § 1531(b). To say that the Act protects ecosystems is not to say
            that the Act creates (if it were possible) rights of action in persons who have not been
            injured in fact, that is, persons who use portions of an ecosystem not perceptibly
            affected by the unlawful action in question.</p>
         <p>Respondents' other theories are called, alas, the "animal nexus" approach, whereby
            anyone who has an interest in studying or seeing the endangered animals anywhere on the
            globe has standing; and the "vocational nexus" approach, under which anyone with a
            professional interest in such animals can sue. Under these theories, anyone who goes to
            see Asian elephants in the Bronx Zoo, and anyone who is a keeper of Asian elephants in
            the Bronx Zoo, has standing to sue because the Director of the Agency for International
            Development (AID) did not consult with the Secretary regarding the AID-funded project in
            Sri Lanka. This is beyond all reason. Standing is not "an ingenious academic exercise in
            the conceivable," United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures
            (SCRAP), 412 U. S. 669, 688 (1973), but as we have said requires, at the summary
            judgment stage, a factual showing of perceptible harm. It is clear that the person who
            observes or works with a particular animal threatened by a federal decision is facing
            perceptible harm, since the very subject of his interest will no longer exist. It is
            even plausible&#x97;though it goes to the outermost limit of plausibility&#x97;to think
            that a person who observes or works with animals of a particular species in the very
            area of the world where that species is threatened by a federal decision is facing such
            harm, since some animals that <span class="star-pagination">*567</span> might have been
            the subject of his interest will no longer exist, see Japan Whaling Assn. v. American
            Cetacean Society, 478 U. S. 221, 231, n. 4 (1986). It goes beyond the limit, however,
            and into pure speculation and fantasy, to say that anyone who observes or works with an
            endangered species, anywhere in the world, is appreciably harmed by a single project
            affecting some portion of that species with which he has no more specific
               connection.<span class="sup">[3]</span>

         <h2>
            <span class="star-pagination">*568</span> B</h2>
         <p>Besides failing to show injury, respondents failed to demonstrate redressability.
            Instead of attacking the separate decisions to fund particular projects allegedly
            causing them harm, respondents chose to challenge a more generalized level of Government
            action (rules regarding consultation), the invalidation of which would affect all
            overseas projects. This programmatic approach has obvious practical advantages, but also
            obvious difficulties insofar as proof of causation or redressability is concerned. As we
            have said in another context, "suits challenging, not specifically identifiable
            Government violations of law, but the particular programs agencies establish to carry
            out their legal obligations . . . [are], even when premised on allegations of several
            instances of violations of law, . . . rarely if ever appropriate for federalcourt
            adjudication." Allen, 468 U. S., at 759-760.</p>
         <p>The most obvious problem in the present case is redressability. Since the agencies
            funding the projects were not parties to the case, the District Court could accord
            relief only against the Secretary: He could be ordered to revise his regulation to
            require consultation for foreign projects. But this would not remedy respondents'
            alleged injury unless the funding agencies were bound by the Secretary's regulation,
            which is very much an open question. Whereas in other contexts the ESA is quite explicit
            as to the Secretary's controlling authority, see, e. g., 16 U. S. C. § 1533(a)(1) ("The
            Secretary shall" promulgate regulations determining endangered species); § 1535(d)(1)
            ("The Secretary is authorized to provide financial assistance to any State"), with
            respect to consultation the initiative, and hence arguably the initial responsibility
            for determining statutory necessity, lies with <span class="star-pagination">*569</span>
            the agencies, see § 1536(a)(2) ("Each Federal agency shall, in consultation with and
            with the assistance of the Secretary, insure that any" funded action is not likely to
            jeopardize endangered or threatened species) (emphasis added). When the Secretary
            promulgated the regulation at issue here, he thought it was binding on the agencies, see
            51 Fed. Reg. 19928 (1986). The Solicitor General, however, has repudiated that position
            here, and the agencies themselves apparently deny the Secretary's authority. (During the
            period when the Secretary took the view that § 7(a)(2) did apply abroad, AID and FWS
            engaged in a running controversy over whether consultation was required with respect to
            the Mahaweli project, AID insisting that consultation applied only to domestic
            actions.)</p>
         <p>Respondents assert that this legal uncertainty did not affect redressability (and hence
            standing) because the District Court itself could resolve the issue of the Secretary's
            authority as a necessary part of its standing inquiry. Assuming that it is appropriate
            to resolve an issue of law such as this in connection with a threshold standing inquiry,
            resolution by the District Court would not have remedied respondents' alleged injury
            anyway, because it would not have been binding upon the agencies. They were not parties
            to the suit, and there is no reason they should be obliged to honor an incidental legal
            determination the suit produced.<span class="sup">[4]</span> The <span
               class="star-pagination">*570</span> Court of Appeals tried to finesse this problem by
            simply proclaiming that "[w]e are satisfied that an injunction requiring the Secretary
            to publish [respondents' desired] regulatio[n]. . . would result in consultation."
            Defenders of Wildlife, 851 F. 2d, at 1042, 1043-1044. We do not know what would justify
            that confidence, particularly when the Justice Department (presumably after consultation
            with the agencies) has taken the position that the regulation is not binding.<span
               class="sup">[5]</span> The <span class="star-pagination">*571</span> short of the
            matter is that redress of the only injury in fact respondents complain of requires
            action (termination of funding until consultation) by the individual funding agencies;
            and any relief the District Court could have provided in this suit against the Secretary
            was not likely to produce that action.</p>
         <p>A further impediment to redressability is the fact that the agencies generally supply
            only a fraction of the funding for a foreign project. AID, for example, has provided
            less than 10% of the funding for the Mahaweli project. Respondents have produced nothing
            to indicate that the projects they have named will either be suspended, or do less harm
            to listed species, if that fraction is eliminated. As in Simon, 426 U. S., at 43-44, it
            is entirely conjectural whether the nonagency activity that affects respondents will be
            altered or affected by the agency activity they seek to achieve.<span class="sup"
               >[6]</span> There is no standing.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>IV</h2>
         <p>The Court of Appeals found that respondents had standing for an additional reason:
            because they had suffered a "procedural injury." The so-called "citizen-suit" provision
            of the ESA provides, in pertinent part, that "any person may commence <span
               class="star-pagination">*572</span> a civil suit on his own behalf (A) to enjoin any
            person, including the United States and any other governmental instrumentality or agency
            . . . who is alleged to be in violation of any provision of this chapter." 16 U. S. C. §
            1540(g). The court held that, because § 7(a)(2) requires interagency consultation, the
            citizen-suit provision creates a "procedural righ[t]" to consultation in all
            "persons"&#x97;so that anyone can file suit in federal court to challenge the
            Secretary's (or presumably any other official's) failure to follow the assertedly
            correct consultative procedure, notwithstanding his or her inability to allege any
            discrete injury flowing from that failure. 911 F. 2d, at 121-122. To understand the
            remarkable nature of this holding one must be clear about what it does not rest upon:
            This is not a case where plaintiffs are seeking to enforce a procedural requirement the
            disregard of which could impair a separate concrete interest of theirs (e. g., the
            procedural requirement for a hearing prior to denial of their license application, or
            the procedural requirement for an environmental impact statement before a federal
            facility is constructed next door to them).<span class="sup">[7]</span> Nor is it simply
            a case where concrete injury has been suffered by many persons, as in mass fraud or mass
            tort situations. Nor, finally, is it the <span class="star-pagination">*573</span>
            unusual case in which Congress has created a concrete private interest in the outcome of
            a suit against a private party for the Government's benefit, by providing a cash bounty
            for the victorious plaintiff. Rather, the court held that the injury-in-fact requirement
            had been satisfied by congressional conferral upon all persons of an abstract,
            selfcontained, noninstrumental "right" to have the Executive observe the procedures
            required by law. We reject this view.<span class="sup">[8]</span>
         </p>
         <p>We have consistently held that a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance
            about government&#x97;claiming only harm to his and every citizen's interest in proper
            application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that <span
               class="star-pagination">*574</span> no more directly and tangibly benefits him than
            it does the public at large&#x97;does not state an Article III case or controversy. For
            example, in Fairchild v. Hughes, 258 U. S. 126, 129-130 (1922), we dismissed a suit
            challenging the propriety of the process by which the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified.
            Justice Brandeis wrote for the Court:</p> "[This is] not a case within the meaning of .
         . . Article III . . . . Plaintiff has [asserted] only the right, possessed by every
         citizen, to require that the Government be administered according to law and that the
         public moneys be not wasted. Obviously this general right does not entitle a private
         citizen to institute in the federal courts a suit . . . ." Ibid. <p>In Massachusetts v.
            Mellon, 262 U. S. 447 (1923), we dismissed for lack of Article III standing a taxpayer
            suit challenging the propriety of certain federal expenditures. We said:</p> "The party
         who invokes the power [of judicial review] must be able to show not only that the statute
         is invalid but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct
         injury as the result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite
         way in common with people generally. . . . Here the parties plaintiff have no such case. .
         . . [T]heir complaint . . . is merely that officials of the executive department of the
         government are executing and will execute an act of Congress asserted to be
         unconstitutional; and this we are asked to prevent. To do so would be not to decide a
         judicial controversy, but to assume a position of authority over the governmental acts of
         another and coequal department, an authority which plainly we do not possess." Id., at
         488-489. <p>In Ex parte Lévitt, 302 U. S. 633 (1937), we dismissed a suit contending that
            Justice Black's appointment to this Court violated the Ineligibility Clause, Art. I, §
            6, cl. 2. <span class="star-pagination">*575</span> "It is an established principle," we
            said, "that to entitle a private individual to invoke the judicial power to determine
            the validity of executive or legislative action he must show that he has sustained or is
            immediately in danger of sustaining a direct injury as the result of that action and it
            is not sufficient that he has merely a general interest common to all members of the
            public." 302 U. S., at 634. See also Doremus v. Board of Ed. of Hawthorne, 342 U. S.
            429, 433&#x97; 434 (1952) (dismissing taxpayer action on the basis of Mellon ).</p>
         <p>More recent cases are to the same effect. In United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166
            (1974), we dismissed for lack of standing a taxpayer suit challenging the Government's
            failure to disclose the expenditures of the Central Intelligence Agency, in alleged
            violation of the constitutional requirement, Art. I, § 9, cl. 7, that "a regular
            Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be
            published from time to time." We held that such a suit rested upon an impermissible
            "generalized grievance," and was inconsistent with "the framework of Article III"
            because "the impact on [plaintiff] is plainly undifferentiated and `common to all
            members of the public.' " Richardson, supra, at 171, 176-177. And in Schlesinger v.
            Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208 (1974), we dismissed for the same
            reasons a citizen-taxpayer suit contending that it was a violation of the
            Incompatibility Clause, Art. I, § 6, cl. 2, for Members of Congress to hold commissions
            in the military Reserves. We said that the challenged action, "standing alone, would
            adversely affect only the generalized interest of all citizens in constitutional
            governance. . . . We reaffirm Lévitt in holding that standing to sue may not be
            predicated upon an interest of th[is] kind . . . ." Schlesinger, supra, at 217, 220.
            Since Schlesinger we have on two occasions held that an injury amounting only to the
            alleged violation of a right to have the Government act in accordance with law was not
            judicially cognizable because <span class="star-pagination">*576</span> "`assertion of a
            right to a particular kind of Government conduct, which the Government has violated by
            acting differently, cannot alone satisfy the requirements of Art. III without draining
            those requirements of meaning.' " Allen, 468 U. S., at 754; Valley Forge Christian
            College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 483
            (1982). And only two Terms ago, we rejected the notion that Article III permits a
            citizen suit to prevent a condemned criminal's execution on the basis of "`the public
            interest protections of the Eighth Amendment' "; once again, "[t]his allegation raise[d]
            only the `generalized interest of all citizens in constitutional governance' . . . and
            [was] an inadequate basis on which to grant . . . standing." Whitmore, 495 U. S., at
            160.</p>
         <p>To be sure, our generalized-grievance cases have typically involved Government violation
            of procedures assertedly ordained by the Constitution rather than the Congress. But
            there is absolutely no basis for making the Article III inquiry turn on the source of
            the asserted right. Whether the courts were to act on their own, or at the invitation of
            Congress, in ignoring the concrete injury requirement described in our cases, they would
            be discarding a principle fundamental to the separate and distinct constitutional role
            of the Third Branch&#x97;one of the essential elements that identifies those "Cases" and
            "Controversies" that are the business of the courts rather than of the political
            branches. "The province of the court," as Chief Justice Marshall said in Marbury v.
            Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 170 (1803), "is, solely, to decide on the rights of individuals."
            Vindicating the public interest (including the public interest in Government observance
            of the Constitution and laws) is the function of Congress and the Chief Executive. The
            question presented here is whether the public interest in proper administration of the
            laws (specifically, in agencies' observance of a particular, statutorily prescribed
            procedure) can be converted into an individual right by a statute that denominates it as
            such, and <span class="star-pagination">*577</span> that permits all citizens (or, for
            that matter, a subclass of citizens who suffer no distinctive concrete harm) to sue. If
            the concrete injury requirement has the separation-ofpowers significance we have always
            said, the answer must be obvious: To permit Congress to convert the undifferentiated
            public interest in executive officers' compliance with the law into an "individual
            right" vindicable in the courts is to permit Congress to transfer from the President to
            the courts the Chief Executive's most important constitutional duty, to "take Care that
            the Laws be faithfully executed," Art. II, § 3. It would enable the courts, with the
            permission of Congress, "to assume a position of authority over the governmental acts of
            another and co-equal department," Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S., at 489, and to
            become "`virtually continuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness of Executive action.'
            " Allen, supra, at 760 (quoting Laird v. Tatum, 408 U. S. 1, 15 (1972)). We have always
            rejected that vision of our role:</p> "When Congress passes an Act empowering
         administrative agencies to carry on governmental activities, the power of those agencies is
         circumscribed by the authority granted. This permits the courts to participate in law
         enforcement entrusted to administrative bodies only to the extent necessary to protect
         justiciable individual rights against administrative action fairly beyond the granted
         powers. . . . This is very far from assuming that the courts are charged more than
         administrators or legislators with the protection of the rights of the people. Congress and
         the Executive supervise the acts of administrative agents. . . . But under Article III,
         Congress established courts to adjudicate cases and controversies as to claims of
         infringement of individual rights whether by unlawful action of private persons or by the
         exertion of unauthorized administrative power." Stark v. Wickard, 321 U. S. 288, 309-310
         (1944) (footnote omitted). <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*578</span> "Individual rights," within the meaning of
            this passage, do not mean public rights that have been legislatively pronounced to
            belong to each individual who forms part of the public. See also Sierra Club, 405 U. S.,
            at 740-741, n. 16.</p>
         <p>Nothing in this contradicts the principle that "[t]he . . . injury required by Art. III
            may exist solely by virtue of `statutes creating legal rights, the invasion of which
            creates standing.' " Warth, 422 U. S., at 500 (quoting Linda R. S. v. Richard D., 410 U.
            S. 614, 617, n. 3 (1973)). Both of the cases used by Linda R. S. as an illustration of
            that principle involved Congress' elevating to the status of legally cognizable injuries
            concrete, de facto injuries that were previously inadequate in law (namely, injury to an
            individual's personal interest in living in a racially integrated community, see
            Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U. S. 205, 208-212 (1972), and injury to
            a company's interest in marketing its product free from competition, see Hardin v.
            Kentucky Utilities Co., 390 U. S. 1, 6 (1968)). As we said in Sierra Club, "[Statutory]
            broadening [of] the categories of injury that may be alleged in support of standing is a
            different matter from abandoning the requirement that the party seeking review must
            himself have suffered an injury." 405 U. S., at 738. Whether or not the principle set
            forth in Warth can be extended beyond that distinction, it is clear that in suits
            against the Government, at least, the concrete injury requirement must remain.</p>

         <p>Although I agree with the essential parts of the Court's analysis, I write separately to
            make several observations.</p>
         <p>I agree with the Court's conclusion in Part III&#x97;A that, on the record before us,
            respondents have failed to demonstrate that they themselves are "among the injured."
            Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 735 (1972). This component of the standing inquiry
            is not satisfied unless</p> "[p]laintiffs . . . demonstrate a `personal stake in the
         outcome.' . . . Abstract injury is not enough. The plaintiff must show that he `has
         sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury' as the result of
         the challenged official conduct and the injury or threat of injury must be both `real and
         immediate,' not `conjectural' or `hypothetical.' " Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95,
         101-102 (1983) (citations omitted). <p>While it may seem trivial to require that Mses.
            Kelly and Skilbred acquire airline tickets to the project sites or announce a date
            certain upon which they will return, see ante, at 564, this is not a case where it is
            reasonable to assume that the affiants will be using the sites on a regular basis, see
            Sierra Club v. Morton, supra, at 735, n. 8, nor do the affiants claim to have visited
            the sites since the projects commenced. With respect to the Court's discussion of
            respondents' "ecosystem nexus," "animal nexus," and "vocational nexus" theories, ante,
            at 565-567, I agree that on this record respondents' showing is insufficient to
            establish standing on any of these bases. I am not willing to foreclose the possibility,
            however, that in different circumstances a nexus theory similar to those proffered here
            might support a claim to standing. See Japan Whaling Assn. v. American Cetacean Society,
            478 U. S. 221, 231, n. 4 (1986) ("[R]espondents . . . undoubtedly have alleged a
            sufficient `injury in fact' in that <span class="star-pagination">*580</span> the whale
            watching and studying of their members will be adversely affected by continued whale
            harvesting").</p>
         <p>In light of the conclusion that respondents have not demonstrated a concrete injury here
            sufficient to support standing under our precedents, I would not reach the issue of
            redressability that is discussed by the plurality in Part III&#x97;B.</p>
         <p>I also join Part IV of the Court's opinion with the following observations. As
            Government programs and policies become more complex and far reaching, we must be
            sensitive to the articulation of new rights of action that do not have clear analogs in
            our common-law tradition. Modern litigation has progressed far from the paradigm of
            Marbury suing Madison to get his commission, Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), or
            Ogden seeking an injunction to halt Gibbons' steamboat operations, Gibbons v. Ogden,
               <span class="citation">

               </a>
            </span> (1824). In my view, Congress has the power to define injuries and articulate
            chains of causation that will give rise to a case or controversy where none existed
            before, and I do not read the Court's opinion to suggest a contrary view. See Warth v.
            Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 500 (1975); ante, at 578. In exercising this power, however,
            Congress must at the very least identify the injury it seeks to vindicate and relate the
            injury to the class of persons entitled to bring suit. The citizen-suit provision of the
            Endangered Species Act does not meet these minimal requirements, because while the
            statute purports to confer a right on "any person . . . to enjoin . . . the United
            States and any other governmental instrumentality or agency . . . who is alleged to be
            in violation of any provision of this chapter," it does not of its own force establish
            that there is an injury in "any person" by virtue of any "violation." 16 U. S. C. §
            1540(g)(1)(A).</p>
         <p>The Court's holding that there is an outer limit to the power of Congress to confer
            rights of action is a direct and necessary consequence of the case and controversy
            limitations found in Article III. I agree that it would exceed those limitations if, at
            the behest of Congress and in the absence <span class="star-pagination">*581</span> of
            any showing of concrete injury, we were to entertain citizen suits to vindicate the
            public's nonconcrete interest in the proper administration of the laws. While it does
            not matter how many persons have been injured by the challenged action, the party
            bringing suit must show that the action injures him in a concrete and personal way. This
            requirement is not just an empty formality. It preserves the vitality of the adversarial
            process by assuring both that the parties before the court have an actual, as opposed to
            professed, stake in the outcome, and that "the legal questions presented . . . will be
            resolved, not in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete
            factual context conducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial
            action." Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and
            State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 472 (1982). In addition, the requirement of concrete injury
            confines the Judicial Branch to its proper, limited role in the constitutional framework
            of Government.</p>
         <p>An independent judiciary is held to account through its open proceedings and its
            reasoned judgments. In this process it is essential for the public to know what persons
            or groups are invoking the judicial power, the reasons that they have brought suit, and
            whether their claims are vindicated or denied. The concrete injury requirement helps
            assure that there can be an answer to these questions; and, as the Court's opinion is
            careful to show, that is part of the constitutional design.</p>
         <p>With these observations, I concur in Parts I, II, III&#x97;A, and IV of the Court's
            opinion and in the judgment of the Court.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="concurrence" judge="stevens"><p>Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.</p>
         <p>Because I am not persuaded that Congress intended the consultation requirement in §
            7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), 16 U. S. C. § 1536(a)(2), to apply
            to activities in foreign countries, I concur in the judgment of reversal. I do not,
            however, agree with the Court's conclusion <span class="star-pagination">*582</span>
            that respondents lack standing because the threatened injury to their interest in
            protecting the environment and studying endangered species is not "imminent." Nor do I
            agree with the plurality's additional conclusion that respondents' injury is not
            "redressable" in this litigation.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>In my opinion a person who has visited the critical habitat of an endangered species has
            a professional interest in preserving the species and its habitat, and intends to
            revisit them in the future has standing to challenge agency action that threatens their
            destruction. Congress has found that a wide variety of endangered species of fish,
            wildlife, and plants are of "aesthetic, ecological, educational, historical,
            recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its people." 16 U. S. C. §
            1531(a)(3). Given that finding, we have no license to demean the importance of the
            interest that particular individuals may have in observing any species or its habitat,
            whether those individuals are motivated by esthetic enjoyment, an interest in
            professional research, or an economic interest in preservation of the species. Indeed,
            this Court has often held that injuries to such interests are sufficient to confer
               standing,<span class="sup">[1]</span> and the Court reiterates that holding today.
            See ante, at 562-563.</p>
         <p>The Court nevertheless concludes that respondents have not suffered "injury in fact"
            because they have not shown that the harm to the endangered species will produce
            "imminent" injury to them. See ante, at 564. I disagree. An injury to an individual's
            interest in studying or enjoying a species and its natural habitat occurs when someone
            (whether it be the Government or a private party) takes action that harms that species
            and habitat. In my judgment, <span class="star-pagination">*583</span> therefore, the
            "imminence" of such an injury should be measured by the timing and likelihood of the
            threatened environmental harm, rather than&#x97;as the Court seems to suggest, ante, at
            564, and n. 2&#x97;by the time that might elapse between the present and the time when
            the individuals would visit the area if no such injury should occur.</p>
         <p>To understand why this approach is correct and consistent with our precedent, it is
            necessary to consider the purpose of the standing doctrine. Concerned about "the
            proper&#x97; and properly limited&#x97;role of the courts in a democratic society," we
            have long held that "Art. III judicial power exists only to redress or otherwise to
            protect against injury to the complaining party." Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490,
            498-499 (1975). The plaintiff must have a "personal stake in the outcome" sufficient to
            "assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which
            the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult . . . questions." Baker v.
            Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 204 (1962). For that reason, "[a]bstract injury is not enough. It
            must be alleged that the plaintiff `has sustained or is immediately in danger of
            sustaining some direct injury' as the result of the challenged statute or official
            conduct. . . . The injury or threat of injury must be both `real and immediate,' not
            `conjectural,' or `hypothetical.' " O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S. 488, 494 (1974)
            (quoting Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U. S. 103, 109-110 (1969)).</p>
         <p>Consequently, we have denied standing to plaintiffs whose likelihood of suffering any
            concrete adverse effect from the challenged action was speculative. See, e. g., Whitmore
            v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 158-159 (1990); Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 105
            (1983); O'Shea, 414 U. S., at 497. In this case, however, the likelihood that
            respondents will be injured by the destruction of the endangered species is not
            speculative. If respondents are genuinely interested in the preservation of the
            endangered species and intend to study or observe these animals in the future, their
            injury will occur as soon as the animals are destroyed. Thus the only potential <span
               class="star-pagination">*584</span> source of "speculation" in this case is whether
            respondents' intent to study or observe the animals is genuine.<span class="sup"
               >[2]</span> In my view, Joyce Kelly and Amy Skilbred have introduced sufficient
            evidence to negate petitioner's contention that their claims of injury are "speculative"
            or "conjectural." As Justice Blackmun explains, post, at 591-592, a reasonable finder of
            fact could conclude, from their past visits, their professional backgrounds, and their
            affidavits and deposition testimony, that Ms. Kelly and Ms. Skilbred will return to the
            project sites and, consequently, will be injured by the destruction of the endangered
            species and critical habitat.</p>
         <p>The plurality also concludes that respondents' injuries are not redressable in this
            litigation for two reasons. First, respondents have sought only a declaratory judgment
            that the Secretary of the Interior's regulation interpreting § 7(a)(2) to require
            consultation only for agency actions in the United States or on the high seas is invalid
            and an injunction requiring him to promulgate a new regulation requiring consultation
            for agency actions abroad as well. But, the plurality opines, even if respondents
            succeed and a new regulation is <span class="star-pagination">*585</span> promulgated,
            there is no guarantee that federal agencies that are not parties to this case will
            actually consult with the Secretary. See ante, at 568-571. Furthermore, the plurality
            continues, respondents have not demonstrated that federal agencies can influence the
            behavior of the foreign governments where the affected projects are located. Thus, even
            if the agencies consult with the Secretary and terminate funding for foreign projects,
            the foreign governments might nonetheless pursue the projects and jeopardize the
            endangered species. See ante, at 571. Neither of these reasons is persuasive.</p>
         <p>We must presume that if this Court holds that § 7(a)(2) requires consultation, all
            affected agencies would abide by that interpretation and engage in the requisite
            consultations. Certainly the Executive Branch cannot be heard to argue that an
            authoritative construction of the governing statute by this Court may simply be ignored
            by any agency head. Moreover, if Congress has required consultation between agencies, we
            must presume that such consultation will have a serious purpose that is likely to
            produce tangible results. As Justice Blackmun explains, post, at 599-601, it is not mere
            speculation to think that foreign governments, when faced with the threatened withdrawal
            of United States assistance, will modify their projects to mitigate the harm to
            endangered species.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>Although I believe that respondents have standing, I nevertheless concur in the judgment
            of reversal because I am persuaded that the Government is correct in its submission that
            § 7(a)(2) does not apply to activities in foreign countries. As with all questions of
            statutory construction, the question whether a statute applies extraterritorially is one
            of congressional intent. Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 284-285 (1949). We
            normally assume that "Congress is primarily concerned with domestic conditions," id., at
            285, and therefore presume that "`legislation of Congress, unless a <span
               class="star-pagination">*586</span> contrary intent appears, is meant to apply only
            within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States,' " EEOC v. Arabian American
            Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248 (1991) (quoting Foley Bros., 336 U. S., at 285).</p>
         <p>Section 7(a)(2) provides, in relevant part:</p> "Each Federal agency shall, in
         consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary [of the Interior or Commerce, as
            appropriate<span class="sup">[3]</span>], insure that any action authorized, funded, or
         carried out by such agency (hereinafter in this section referred to as an `agency action')
         is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened
         species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species
         which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation as appropriate with affected
         States, to be critical, unless such agency has been granted an exemption for such action by
         the Committee pursuant to subsection (h) of this section. . .." 16 U. S. C. § 1536(a)(2).
            <p>Nothing in this text indicates that the section applies in foreign countries.<span
               class="sup">[4]</span> Indeed, the only geographic reference in <span
               class="star-pagination">*587</span> the section is in the "critical habitat"
               clause,<span class="sup">[5]</span> which mentions "affected States." The Secretary
            of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce have consistently taken the position that
            they need not designate critical habitat in foreign countries. See 42 Fed. Reg. 4869
            (1977) (initial regulations of the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine
            Fisheries Service on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of
            Commerce). Consequently, neither Secretary interprets § 7(a)(2) to require federal
            agencies to engage in consultations to ensure that their actions in foreign countries
            will not adversely affect the critical habitat of endangered or threatened species.</p>
         <p>That interpretation is sound, and, in fact, the Court of Appeals did not question
               it.<span class="sup">[6]</span> There is, moreover, no indication that Congress
            intended to give a different geographic scope to the two clauses in § 7(a)(2). To the
            contrary, Congress recognized that one of the "major causes" of extinction of <span
               class="star-pagination">*588</span> endangered species is the "destruction of natural
            habitat." S. Rep. No. 93-307, p. 2 (1973); see also H. Rep. No. 93-412, p. 2 (1973); TVA
            v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153, 179 (1978). It would thus be illogical to conclude that Congress
            required federal agencies to avoid jeopardy to endangered species abroad, but not
            destruction of critical habitat abroad.</p>
         <p>The lack of an express indication that the consultation requirement applies
            extraterritorially is particularly significant because other sections of the ESA
            expressly deal with the problem of protecting endangered species abroad. Section 8, for
            example, authorizes the President to provide assistance to "any foreign country (with
            its consent) . . . in the development and management of programs in that country which
            [are] . . . necessary or useful for the conservation of any endangered species or
            threatened species listed by the Secretary pursuant to section 1533 of this title." 16
            U. S. C. § 1537(a). It also directs the Secretary of the Interior, "through the
            Secretary of State," to "encourage" foreign countries to conserve fish and wildlife and
            to enter into bilateral or multilateral agreements. § 1537(b). Section 9 makes it
            unlawful to import endangered species into (or export them from) the United States or to
            otherwise traffic in endangered species "in interstate or foreign commerce." §§
            1538(a)(1)(A), (E), (F). Congress thus obviously thought about endangered species abroad
            and devised specific sections of the ESA to protect them. In this context, the absence
            of any explicit statement that the consultation requirement is applicable to agency
            actions in foreign countries suggests that Congress did not intend that § 7(a)(2) apply
            extraterritorially.</p>
         <p>Finally, the general purpose of the ESA does not evince a congressional intent that the
            consultation requirement be applicable to federal agency actions abroad. The
            congressional findings explaining the need for the ESA emphasize that "various species
            of fish, wildlife, and plants in the United States have been rendered extinct as a
            consequence <span class="star-pagination">*589</span> of economic growth and development
            untempered by adequate concern and conservation," and that these species "are of
            aesthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value to
            the Nation and its people. " §§ 1531(1), (3) (emphasis added). The lack of similar
            findings about the harm caused by development in other countries suggests that Congress
            was primarily concerned with balancing development and conservation goals in this
               country.<span class="sup">[7]</span>
         </p>
         <p>In short, a reading of the entire statute persuades me that Congress did not intend the
            consultation requirement in § 7(a)(2) to apply to activities in foreign countries.
            Accordingly, notwithstanding my disagreement with the Court's disposition of the
            standing question, I concur in its judgment.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="dissent" judge="blackmun"><p>Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice O'Connor joins, dissenting.</p>
         <p>I part company with the Court in this case in two respects. First, I believe that
            respondents have raised genuine issues of fact&#x97;sufficient to survive summary
            judgment&#x97;both as to injury and as to redressability. Second, I question the Court's
            breadth of language in rejecting standing for "procedural" injuries. I fear the Court
            seeks to impose fresh limitations on the constitutional authority of Congress to allow
               <span class="star-pagination">*590</span> citizen suits in the federal courts for
            injuries deemed "procedural" in nature. I dissent.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>Article III of the Constitution confines the federal courts to adjudication of actual
            "Cases" and "Controversies." To ensure the presence of a "case" or "controversy," this
            Court has held that Article III requires, as an irreducible minimum, that a plaintiff
            allege (1) an injury that is (2) "fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful
            conduct" and that is (3) "likely to be redressed by the requested relief." Allen v.
            Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751 (1984).</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>To survive petitioner's motion for summary judgment on standing, respondents need not
            prove that they are actually or imminently harmed. They need show only a "genuine issue"
            of material fact as to standing. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c). This is not a heavy burden.
            A "genuine issue" exists so long as "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could
            return a verdict for the nonmoving party [respondents]." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,
            Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 248 (1986). This Court's "function is not [it]self to weigh the
            evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a
            genuine issue for trial." Id., at 249.</p>
         <p>The Court never mentions the "genuine issue" standard. Rather, the Court refers to the
            type of evidence it feels respondents failed to produce, namely, "affidavits or other
            evidence showing, through specific facts" the existence of injury. Ante, at 563. The
            Court thereby confuses respondents' evidentiary burden (i. e., affidavits asserting
            "specific facts") in withstanding a summary judgment motion under Rule 56(e) with the
            standard of proof (i. e., the existence of a "genuine issue" of "material fact") under
            Rule 56(c).</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>
            <span class="star-pagination">*591</span> 1</h2>
         <p>Were the Court to apply the proper standard for summary judgment, I believe it would
            conclude that the sworn affidavits and deposition testimony of Joyce Kelly and Amy
            Skilbred advance sufficient facts to create a genuine issue for trial concerning whether
            one or both would be imminently harmed by the Aswan and Mahaweli projects. In the first
            instance, as the Court itself concedes, the affidavits contained facts making it at
            least "questionable" (and therefore within the province of the factfinder) that certain
            agencyfunded projects threaten listed species.<span class="sup">[1]</span>Ante, at 564.
            The only remaining issue, then, is whether Kelly and Skilbred have shown that they
            personally would suffer imminent harm.</p>
         <p>I think a reasonable finder of fact could conclude from the information in the
            affidavits and deposition testimony that either Kelly or Skilbred will soon return to
            the project sites, thereby satisfying the "actual or imminent" injury standard. The
            Court dismisses Kelly's and Skilbred's general statements <span class="star-pagination"
               >*592</span> that they intended to revisit the project sites as "simply not enough."
            Ibid. But those statements did not stand alone. A reasonable finder of fact could
            conclude, based not only upon their statements of intent to return, but upon their past
            visits to the project sites, as well as their professional backgrounds, that it was
            likely that Kelly and Skilbred would make a return trip to the project areas. Contrary
            to the Court's contention that Kelly's and Skilbred's past visits "prov[e] nothing,"
            ibid., the fact of their past visits could demonstrate to a reasonable factfinder that
            Kelly and Skilbred have the requisite resources and personal interest in the
            preservation of the species endangered by the Aswan and Mahaweli projects to make good
            on their intention to return again. Cf. Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 102 (1983)
            ("Past wrongs were evidence bearing on whether there is a real and immediate threat of
            repeated injury") (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, Kelly's and Skilbred's
            professional backgrounds in wildlife preservation, see App. 100, 144, 309-310, also make
            it likely&#x97;at least far more likely than for the average citizen&#x97;that they
            would choose to visit these areas of the world where species are vanishing.</p>
         <p>By requiring a "description of concrete plans" or "specification of when the some day
            [for a return visit] will be," ante, at 564, the Court, in my view, demands what is
            likely an empty formality. No substantial barriers prevent Kelly or Skilbred from simply
            purchasing plane tickets to return to the Aswan and Mahaweli projects. This case differs
            from other cases in which the imminence of harm turned largely on the affirmative
            actions of third parties beyond a plaintiff's control. See Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.
            S. 149, 155-156 (1990) (harm to plaintiff death-row inmate from fellow inmate's
            execution depended on the court's one day reversing plaintiff's conviction or sentence
            and considering comparable sentences at resentencing); Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S.,
            at 105 (harm dependent on police's arresting plaintiff again <span
               class="star-pagination">*593</span> and subjecting him to chokehold); Rizzo v. Goode,
            423 U. S. 362, 372 (1976) (harm rested upon "what one of a small, unnamed minority of
            policemen might do to them in the future because of that unknown policeman's perception
            of departmental disciplinary procedures"); O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S. 488, 495-498
            (1974) (harm from discriminatory conduct of county magistrate and judge dependent on
            plaintiffs' being arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced); Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.
            S. 103, 109 (1969) (harm to plaintiff dependent on a former Congressman's (then serving
            a 14-year term as a judge) running again for Congress). To be sure, a plaintiff's
            unilateral control over his or her exposure to harm does not necessarily render the harm
            nonspeculative. Nevertheless, it suggests that a finder of fact would be far more likely
            to conclude the harm is actual or imminent, especially if given an opportunity to hear
            testimony and determine credibility.</p>
         <p>I fear the Court's demand for detailed descriptions of future conduct will do little to
            weed out those who are genuinely harmed from those who are not. More likely, it will
            resurrect a code-pleading formalism in federal court summary judgment practice, as
            federal courts, newly doubting their jurisdiction, will demand more and more
            particularized showings of future harm. Just to survive summary judgment, for example, a
            property owner claiming a decline in the value of his property from governmental action
            might have to specify the exact date he intends to sell his property and show that there
            is a market for the property, lest it be surmised he might not sell again. A nurse
            turned down for a job on grounds of her race had better be prepared to show on what date
            she was prepared to start work, that she had arranged daycare for her child, and that
            she would not have accepted work at another hospital instead. And a Federal Tort Claims
            Act plaintiff alleging loss of consortium should make sure to furnish this Court with a
            "description of concrete plans" for her nightly schedule of attempted activities.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>
            <span class="star-pagination">*594</span> 2</h2>
         <p>The Court also concludes that injury is lacking, because respondents' allegations of
            "ecosystem nexus" failed to demonstrate sufficient proximity to the site of the
            environmental harm. Ante, at 565-566. To support that conclusion, the Court
            mischaracterizes our decision in Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U. S. 871
            (1990), as establishing a general rule that "a plaintiff claiming injury from
            environmental damage must use the area affected by the challenged activity." Ante, at
            565-566. In National Wildlife Federation, the Court required specific geographical
            proximity because of the particular type of harm alleged in that case: harm to the
            plaintiff's visual enjoyment of nature from mining activities. 497 U. S., at 888. One
            cannot suffer from the sight of a ruined landscape without being close enough to see the
            sites actually being mined. Many environmental injuries, however, cause harm distant
            from the area immediately affected by the challenged action. Environmental destruction
            may affect animals traveling over vast geographical ranges, see, e. g., Japan Whaling
            Assn. v. American Cetacean Society, 478 U. S. 221 (1986) (harm to American whale
            watchers from Japanese whaling activities), or rivers running long geographical courses,
            see, e. g., Arkansas v. Oklahoma, 503 U. S. 91 (1992) (harm to Oklahoma residents from
            wastewater treatment plant 39 miles from border). It cannot seriously be contended that
            a litigant's failure to use the precise or exact site where animals are slaughtered or
            where toxic waste is dumped into a river means he or she cannot show injury.</p>
         <p>The Court also rejects respondents' claim of vocational or professional injury. The
            Court says that it is "beyond all reason" that a zoo "keeper" of Asian elephants would
            have standing to contest his Government's participation in the eradication of all the
            Asian elephants in another part of the world. Ante, at 566. I am unable to see how the
            distant location of the destruction necessarily (for purposes of ruling <span
               class="star-pagination">*595</span> at summary judgment) mitigates the harm to the
            elephant keeper. If there is no more access to a future supply of the animal that
            sustains a keeper's livelihood, surely there is harm.</p>
         <p>I have difficulty imagining this Court applying its rigid principles of geographic
            formalism anywhere outside the context of environmental claims. As I understand it,
            environmental plaintiffs are under no special constitutional standing disabilities. Like
            other plaintiffs, they need show only that the action they challenge has injured them,
            without necessarily showing they happened to be physically near the location of the
            alleged wrong. The Court's decision today should not be interpreted "to foreclose the
            possibility . . . that in different circumstances a nexus theory similar to those
            proffered here might support a claim to standing." Ante, at 579 (Kennedy, J., concurring
            in part and concurring in judgment).</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B</h2>
         <p>A plurality of the Court suggests that respondents have not demonstrated redressability:
            a likelihood that a court ruling in their favor would remedy their injury. Duke Power
            Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 74-75, and n. 20 (1978)
            (plaintiff must show "substantial likelihood" that relief requested will redress the
            injury). The plurality identifies two obstacles. The first is that the "action agencies"
            (e. g., AID) cannot be required to undertake consultation with petitioner Secretary,
            because they are not directly bound as parties to the suit and are otherwise not
            indirectly bound by being subject to petitioner Secretary's regulation. Petitioner,
            however, officially and publicly has taken the position that his regulations regarding
            consultation under § 7 of the Act are binding on action agencies. 50 CFR § 402.14(a)
               (1991).<span class="sup">[2]</span> And he has previously <span
               class="star-pagination">*596</span> taken the same position in this very litigation,
            having stated in his answer to the complaint that petitioner "admits the Fish and
            Wildlife Service (FWS) was designated the lead agency for the formulation of regulations
            concerning section 7 of the [Endangered Species Act]." App. 246. I cannot agree with the
            plurality that the Secretary (or the Solicitor General) is now free, for the convenience
            of this appeal, to disavow his prior public and litigation positions. More generally, I
            cannot agree that the Government is free to play "Three-Card Monte" with its description
            of agencies' authority to defeat standing against the agency given the lead in
            administering a statutory scheme.</p>
         <p>Emphasizing that none of the action agencies are parties to this suit (and having
            rejected the possibility of their being indirectly bound by petitioner's regulation),
            the plurality concludes that "there is no reason they should be obliged to honor an
            incidental legal determination the suit produced." Ante, at 569. I am not as willing as
            the plurality is to assume that agencies at least will not try to follow the law.
            Moreover, I wonder if the plurality has not overlooked the extensive involvement from
            the inception of this litigation by the Department of State and AID.<span class="sup"
               >[3]</span> Under <span class="star-pagination">*597</span> principles of collateral
            estoppel, these agencies are precluded from subsequently relitigating the issues decided
            in this suit.</p> "[O]ne who prosecutes or defends a suit in the name of another to
         establish and protect his own right, or who assists in the prosecution or defense of an
         action in aid of some interest of his own, and who does this openly to the knowledge of the
         opposing party, is as much bound by the judgment and as fully entitled to avail himself of
         it as an estoppel against an adverse party, as he would be if he had been a party to the
         record." Souffront v. Compagnie des Sucreries de Porto Rico, 217 U. S. 475, 487 (1910).
            <p>This principle applies even to the Federal Government. In Montana v. United States,
            440 U. S. 147 (1979), this Court held that the Government was estopped from relitigating
            in federal court the constitutionality of Montana's gross receipts tax, because that
            issue previously had been litigated in state court by an individual contractor whose
            litigation had been financed and controlled by the Federal Government. "Thus, although
            not a party, the United States plainly had a sufficient `laboring oar' in the conduct of
            the state-court litigation to actuate principles of estoppel." Id., at 155. See also
            United States v. Mendoza, 464 U. S. 154, 164, n. 9 (1984) (Federal Government estopped
            where it "constituted a `party' in all but a technical sense"). In my view, the action
            agencies have had sufficient "laboring oars" in this litigation since its inception to
            be bound from subsequent <span class="star-pagination">*598</span> relitigation of the
            extraterritorial scope of the § 7 consultation requirement.<span class="sup">[4]</span>
            As a result, I believe respondents' injury would likely be redressed by a favorable
            decision.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*599</span> The second redressability obstacle relied on
            by the plurality is that "the [action] agencies generally supply only a fraction of the
            funding for a foreign project." Ante, at 571. What this Court might "generally" take to
            be true does not eliminate the existence of a genuine issue of fact to withstand summary
            judgment. Even if the action agencies supply only a fraction of the funding for a
            particular foreign project, it remains at least a question for the finder of fact
            whether threatened withdrawal of that fraction would affect foreign government conduct
            sufficiently to avoid harm to listed species.</p>
         <p>The plurality states that "AID, for example, has provided less than 10% of the funding
            for the Mahaweli project." Ibid. The plurality neglects to mention that this "fraction"
            amounts to $170 million, see App. 159, not so paltry a sum for a country of only 16
            million people with a gross national product of less than $6 billion in 1986 when
            respondents filed <span class="star-pagination">*600</span> the complaint in this
            action. Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, Sri Lanka: A Country Study (Area
            Handbook Series) xvi-xvii (1990).</p>
         <p>The plurality flatly states: "Respondents have produced nothing to indicate that the
            projects they have named will. . . doless harm to listed species, if that fraction is
            eliminated." Ante, at 571. As an initial matter, the relevant inquiry is not, as the
            plurality suggests, what will happen if AID or other agencies stop funding projects, but
            what will happen if AID or other agencies comply with the consultation requirement for
            projects abroad. Respondents filed suit to require consultation, not a termination of
            funding. Respondents have raised at least a genuine issue of fact that the projects harm
            endangered species and that the actions of AID and other United States agencies can
            mitigate that harm.</p>
         <p>The plurality overlooks an Interior Department memorandum listing eight endangered or
            threatened species in the Mahaweli project area and recounting that "[t]he Sri Lankan
            government has requested the assistance of AID in mitigating the negative impacts to the
            wildlife involved." App. 78. Further, a letter from the Director of the Fish and
            Wildlife Service to AID states:</p> "The Sri Lankan government lacks the necessary
         finances to undertake any long-term management programs to avoid the negative impacts to
         the wildlife. The donor nations and agencies that are financing the [Mahaweli project] will
         be the key as to how successfully the wildlife is preserved. If wildlife problems receive
         the same level of attention as the engineering project, then the negative impacts to the
         environment can be alleviated. This means that there has to be long-term funding in
         sufficient amounts to stem the negative impacts of this project." Id., at 216. <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*601</span> I do not share the plurality's astonishing
            confidence that, on the record here, a factfinder could only conclude that AID was
            powerless to ensure the protection of listed species at the Mahaweli project.</p>
         <p>As for the Aswan project, the record again rebuts the plurality's assumption that donor
            agencies are without any authority to protect listed species. Kelly asserted in her
            affidavit&#x97;and it has not been disputed&#x97;that the Bureau of Reclamation was
            "overseeing" the rehabilitation of the Aswan project. Id., at 101. See also id., at 65
            (Bureau of Reclamation publication stating: "In 1982, the Egyptian government . . .
            requested that Reclamation serve as its engineering advisor for the nine-year [Aswan]
            rehabilitation project").</p>
         <p>I find myself unable to agree with the plurality's analysis of redressability, based as
            it is on its invitation of executive lawlessness, ignorance of principles of collateral
            estoppel, unfounded assumptions about causation, and erroneous conclusions about what
            the record does not say. In my view, respondents have satisfactorily shown a genuine
            issue of fact as to whether their injury would likely be redressed by a decision in
            their favor.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>The Court concludes that any "procedural injury" suffered by respondents is insufficient
            to confer standing. It rejects the view that the "injury-in-fact requirement [is]
            satisfied by congressional conferral upon all persons of an abstract, selfcontained,
            noninstrumental `right' to have the Executive observe the procedures required by law."
            Ante, at 573. Whatever the Court might mean with that very broad language, it cannot be
            saying that "procedural injuries" as a class are necessarily insufficient for purposes
            of Article III standing.</p>
         <p>Most governmental conduct can be classified as "procedural." Many injuries caused by
            governmental conduct, therefore, are categorizable at some level of generality as <span
               class="star-pagination">*602</span> "procedural" injuries. Yet, these injuries are
            not categorically beyond the pale of redress by the federal courts. When the Government,
            for example, "procedurally" issues a pollution permit, those affected by the permittee's
            pollutants are not without standing to sue. Only later cases will tell just what the
            Court means by its intimation that "procedural" injuries are not constitutionally
            cognizable injuries. In the meantime, I have the greatest of sympathy for the courts
            across the country that will struggle to understand the Court's standardless exposition
            of this concept today.</p>
         <p>The Court expresses concern that allowing judicial enforcement of "agencies' observance
            of a particular, statutorily prescribed procedure" would "transfer from the President to
            the courts the Chief Executive's most important constitutional duty, to `take Care that
            the Laws be faithfully executed,' Art. II, § 3." Ante, at 576, 577. In fact, the
            principal effect of foreclosing judicial enforcement of such procedures is to transfer
            power into the hands of the Executive at the expense&#x97;not of the courts&#x97;but of
            Congress, from which that power originates and emanates.</p>
         <p>Under the Court's anachronistically formal view of the separation of powers, Congress
            legislates pure, substantive mandates and has no business structuring the procedural
            manner in which the Executive implements these mandates. To be sure, in the ordinary
            course, Congress does legislate in black-and-white terms of affirmative commands or
            negative prohibitions on the conduct of officers of the Executive Branch. In complex
            regulatory areas, however, Congress often legislates, as it were, in procedural shades
            of gray. That is, itsets forth substantive policy goals and provides for their
            attainment by requiring Executive Branch officials to follow certain procedures, for
            example, in the form of reporting, consultation, and certification requirements.</p>
         <p>The Court recently has considered two such procedurally oriented statutes. In Japan
            Whaling Assn. v. American Cetacean Society, 478 U. S. 221 (1986), the Court examined a
               <span class="star-pagination">*603</span> statute requiring the Secretary of Commerce
            to certify to the President that foreign nations were not conducting fishing operations
            or trading which "diminis[h] the effectiveness" of an international whaling convention.
            Id., at 226. The Court expressly found standing to sue. Id., at 230-231, n. 4. In
            Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U. S. 332, 348 (1989), this Court
            considered injury from violation of the "action-forcing" procedures of the National
            Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), in particular the requirements for issuance of
            environmental impact statements.</p>
         <p>The consultation requirement of § 7 of the Endangered Species Act is a similar,
            action-forcing statute. Consultation is designed as an integral check on federal agency
            action, ensuring that such action does not go forward without full consideration of its
            effects on listed species. Once consultation is initiated, the Secretary is under a duty
            to provide to the action agency "a written statement setting forth the Secretary's
            opinion, and a summary of the information on which the opinion is based, detailing how
            the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat." 16 U. S. C. §
            1536(b)(3)(A). The Secretary is also obligated to suggest "reasonable and prudent
            alternatives" to prevent jeopardy to listed species. Ibid. The action agency must
            undertake as well its own "biological assessment for the purpose of identifying any
            endangered species or threatened species" likely to be affected by agency action. §
            1536(c)(1). After the initiation of consultation, the action agency "shall not make any
            irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources" which would foreclose the
            "formulation or implementation of any reasonable and prudent alternative measures" to
            avoid jeopardizing listed species. § 1536(d). These action-forcing procedures are
            "designed to protect some threatened concrete interest," ante, at 573, n. 8, of persons
            who observe and work with endangered or threatened species. That is why I am mystified
            by the Court's unsupported conclusion that "[t]his is not a case where plaintiffs <span
               class="star-pagination">*604</span> are seeking to enforce a procedural requirement
            the disregard of which could impair a separate concrete interest of theirs." Ante, at
            572.</p>
         <p>Congress legislates in procedural shades of gray not to aggrandize its own power but to
            allow maximum Executive discretion in the attainment of Congress' legislative goals.
            Congress could simply impose a substantive prohibition on Executive conduct; it could
            say that no agency action shall result in the loss of more than 5% of any listed
            species. Instead, Congress sets forth substantive guidelines and allows the Executive,
            within certain procedural constraints, to decide how best to effectuate the ultimate
            goal. See American Power &amp;amp; Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U. S. 90, 105 (1946). The Court
            never has questioned Congress' authority to impose such procedural constraints on
            Executive power. Just as Congress does not violate separation of powers by structuring
            the procedural manner in which the Executive shall carry out the laws, surely the
            federal courts do not violate separation of powers when, at the very instruction and
            command of Congress, they enforce these procedures.</p>
         <p>To prevent Congress from conferring standing for "procedural injuries" is another way of
            saying that Congress may not delegate to the courts authority deemed "executive" in
            nature. Ante, at 577 (Congress may not "transfer from the President to the courts the
            Chief Executive's most important constitutional duty, to `take Care that the Laws be
            faithfully executed,' Art. II, § 3"). Here Congress seeks not to delegate "executive"
            power but only to strengthen the procedures it has legislatively mandated. "We have long
            recognized that the nondelegation doctrine does not prevent Congress from seeking
            assistance, within proper limits, from its coordinate Branches." Touby v. United States,
            500 U. S. 160, 165 (1991). "Congress does not violate the Constitution merely because it
            legislates in broad terms, leaving a certain degree of discretion to executive or
            judicial actors. " Ibid. (emphasis added).</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*605</span> Ironically, this Court has previously
            justified a relaxed review of congressional delegation to the Executive on grounds that
            Congress, in turn, has subjected the exercise of that power to judicial review. INS v.
            Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 953-954, n. 16 (1983); American Power &amp;amp; Light Co. v. SEC,
            329 U. S., at 105-106. The Court's intimation today that procedural injuries are not
            constitutionally cognizable threatens this understanding upon which Congress has
            undoubtedly relied. In no sense is the Court's suggestion compelled by our "common
            understanding of what activities are appropriate to legislatures, to executives, and to
            courts." Ante, at 560. In my view, it reflects an unseemly solicitude for an expansion
            of power of the Executive Branch.</p>
         <p>It is to be hoped that over time the Court will acknowledge that some classes of
            procedural duties are so enmeshed with the prevention of a substantive, concrete harm
            that an individual plaintiff may be able to demonstrate a sufficient likelihood of
            injury just through the breach of that procedural duty. For example, in the context of
            the NEPA requirement of environmental-impact statements, this Court has acknowledged "it
            is now well settled that NEPA itself does not mandate particular results [and] simply
            prescribes the necessary process," but "these procedures are almost certain to affect
            the agency's substantive decision. " Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.
            S., at 350 (emphasis added). See also Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U. S. 347, 350-351
            (1979) ("If environmental concerns are not interwoven into the fabric of agency
            planning, the `actionforcing' characteristics of [the environmental-impact statement
            requirement] would be lost"). This acknowledgment of an inextricable link between
            procedural and substantive harm does not reflect improper appellate factfinding. It
            reflects nothing more than the proper deference owed to the judgment of a coordinate
            branch&#x97;Congress&#x97;that certain procedures are directly tied to protection
            against a substantive harm.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*606</span> In short, determining "injury" for Article III
            standing purposes is a fact-specific inquiry. "Typically . . . the standing inquiry
            requires careful judicial examination of a complaint's allegations to ascertain whether
            the particular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the particular claims
            asserted." Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S., at 752. There may be factual circumstances in
            which a congressionally imposed procedural requirement is so insubstantially connected
            to the prevention of a substantive harm that it cannot be said to work any conceivable
            injury to an individual litigant. But, as a general matter, the courts owe substantial
            deference to Congress' substantive purpose in imposing a certain procedural requirement.
            In all events, "[o]ur separation-ofpowers analysis does not turn on the labeling of an
            activity as `substantive' as opposed to `procedural.' " Mistretta v. United States, 488
            U. S. 361, 393 (1989). There is no room for a per se rule or presumption excluding
            injuries labeled "procedural" in nature.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>In conclusion, I cannot join the Court on what amounts to a slash-and-burn expedition
            through the law of environmental standing. In my view, "[t]he very essence of civil
            liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of
            the laws, whenever he receives an injury." Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 163

         <p>[1] By particularized, we mean that the injury must affect the plaintiff in a personal
            and individual way.</p>
         <p>[2] The dissent acknowledges the settled requirement that the injury complained of be,
            if not actual, then at least imminent, but it contends that respondents could get past
            summary judgment because "a reasonable finder of fact could conclude . . . that . . .
            Kelly or Skilbred will soon return to the project sites." Post, at 591. This analysis
            suffers either from a factual or from a legal defect, depending on what the "soon" is
            supposed to mean. If "soon" refers to the standard mandated by our precedents&#x97; that
            the injury be "imminent," Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 155 (1990)&#x97;we are at
            a loss to see how, as a factual matter, the standard can be met by respondents' mere
            profession of an intent, some day, to return. But if, as we suspect, "soon" means
            nothing more than "in this lifetime," then the dissent has undertaken quite a departure
            from our precedents. Although "imminence" is concededly a somewhat elastic concept, it
            cannot be stretched beyond its purpose, which is to ensure that the alleged injury is
            not too speculative for Article III purposes&#x97;that the injury is "` "certainly
            impending,"` " id. , at 158 (emphasis added). It has been stretched beyond the breaking
            point when, as here, the plaintiff alleges only an injury at some indefinite future
            time, and the acts necessary to make the injury happen are at least partly within the
            plaintiff's own control. In such circumstances we have insisted that the injury proceed
            with a high degree of immediacy, so as to reduce the possibility of deciding a case in
            which no injury would have occurred at all. See, e. g., id., at 156-160; Los Angeles v.
            Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 102-106 (1983). </p>
         <p>There is no substance to the dissent's suggestion that imminence is demanded only when
            the alleged harm depends upon "the affirmative actions of third parties beyond a
            plaintiff's control," post, at 592. Our cases mention third-party-caused contingency,
            naturally enough; but they also mention the plaintiff's failure to show that he will
            soon expose himself to the injury, see, e. g., Lyons, supra, at 105-106; O'Shea v.
            Littleton, 414 U. S. 488, 497 (1974); Ashcroft v. Mattis, 431 U. S. 171, 172-173, n. 2
            (1977) (per curiam). And there is certainly no reason in principle to demand evidence
            that third persons will take the action exposing the plaintiff to harm, while presuming
            that the plaintiff himself will do so.</p>
         <p>Our insistence upon these established requirements of standing does not mean that we
            would, as the dissent contends, "demand . . . detailed descriptions" of damages, such as
            a "nightly schedule of attempted activities" from plaintiffs alleging loss of
            consortium. Post, at 593. That case and the others posited by the dissent all involve
            actual harm; the existence of standing is clear, though the precise extent of harm
            remains to be determined at trial. Where there is no actual harm, however, its imminence
            (though not its precise extent) must be established.</p>
         <p>[3] The dissent embraces each of respondents' "nexus" theories, rejecting this portion
            of our analysis because it is "unable to see how the distant location of the destruction
            necessarily (for purposes of ruling at summary judgment) mitigates the harm" to the
            plaintiff. Post, at 594-595. But summary judgment must be entered "against a party who
            fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to
            that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial."
            Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U. S. 317, 322 (1986). Respondents had to adduce facts,
            therefore, on the basis of which it could reasonably be found that concrete injury to
            their members was, as our cases require, "certainly impending." The dissent may be
            correct that the geographic remoteness of those members (here in the United States) from
            Sri Lanka and Aswan does not "necessarily " prevent such a finding&#x97;but it assuredly
            does so when no further facts have been brought forward (and respondents have produced
            none) showing that the impact upon animals in those distant places will in some fashion
            be reflected here. The dissent's position to the contrary reduces to the notion that
            distance never prevents harm, a proposition we categorically reject. It cannot be that a
            person with an interest in an animal automatically has standing to enjoin federal
            threats to that species of animal, anywhere in the world. Were that the case, the
            plaintiff in Sierra Club, for example, could have avoided the necessity of establishing
            anyone's use of Mineral King by merely identifying one of its members interested in an
            endangered species of flora or fauna at that location. Justice Blackmun's accusation
            that a special rule is being crafted for "environmental claims," post, at 595, is
            correct, but he is the craftsman. </p>
         <p>Justice Stevens, by contrast, would allow standing on an apparent "animal nexus" theory
            to all plaintiffs whose interest in the animals is "genuine." Such plaintiffs, we are
            told, do not have to visit the animals because the animals are analogous to family
            members. Post, at 583-584, and n. 2. We decline to join Justice Stevens in this Linnaean
            leap. It is unclear to us what constitutes a "genuine" interest; how it differs from a
            "nongenuine" interest (which nonetheless prompted a plaintiff to file suit); and why
            such an interest in animals should be different from such an interest in anything else
            that is the subject of a lawsuit.</p>
         <p>[4] We need not linger over the dissent's facially impracticable suggestion, post, at
            595-596, that one agency of the Government can acquire the power to direct other
            agencies by simply claiming that power in its own regulations and in litigation to which
            the other agencies are not parties. As for the contention that the other agencies will
            be "collaterally estopped" to challenge our judgment that they are bound by the
            Secretary of the Interior's views, because of their participation in this suit, post, at
            596-597: Whether or not that is true now, it was assuredly not true when this suit was
            filed, naming the Secretary alone. "The existence of federal jurisdiction ordinarily
            depends on the facts as they exist when the complaint is filed. " Newman-Green, Inc. v.
            Alfonzo-Larrain, 490 U. S. 826, 830 (1989) (emphasis added). It cannot be that, by later
            participating in the suit, the State Department and AID retroactively created a
            redressability (and hence a jurisdiction) that did not exist at the outset. </p>
         <p>The dissent's rejoinder that redressability was clear at the outset because the
            Secretary thought the regulation binding on the agencies, post, at 598-599, n. 4,
            continues to miss the point: The agencies did not agree with the Secretary, nor would
            they be bound by a district court holding (as to this issue) in the Secretary's favor.
            There is no support for the dissent's novel contention, ibid., that Rule 19 of the
            Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, governing joinder of indispensable parties, somehow
            alters our longstanding rule that jurisdiction is to be assessed under the facts
            existing when the complaint is filed. The redressability element of the Article III
            standing requirement and the "complete relief" referred to by Rule 19 are not identical.
            Finally, we reach the dissent's contention, post, at 599, n. 4, that by refusing to
            waive our settled rule for purposes of this case we have made "federal subject-matter
            jurisdiction . . . a one-way street running the Executive Branch's way." That is so, we
            are told, because the Executive can dispel jurisdiction where it previously existed (by
            either conceding the merits or by pointing out that nonparty agencies would not be bound
            by a ruling), whereas a plaintiff cannot retroactively create jurisdiction based on post
            complaint litigation conduct. But any defendant, not just the Government, can dispel
            jurisdiction by conceding the merits (and presumably thereby suffering a judgment) or by
            demonstrating standing defects. And permitting a defendant to point out a preexisting
            standing defect late in the day is not remotely comparable to permitting a plaintiff to
            establish standing on the basis of the defendant's litigation conduct occurring after
            standing is erroneously determined.</p>
         <p>[5] Seizing on the fortuity that the case has made its way to this Court, Justice
            Stevens protests that no agency would ignore "an authoritative construction of the [ESA]
            by this Court." Post, at 585. In that he is probably correct; in concluding from it that
            plaintiffs have demonstrated redressability, he is not. Since, as we have pointed out
            above, standing is to be determined as of the commencement of suit; since at that point
            it could certainly not be known that the suit would reach this Court; and since it is
            not likely that an agency would feel compelled to accede to the legal view of a district
            court expressed in a case to which it was not a party; redressability clearly did not
            exist.</p>
         <p>[6] The dissent criticizes us for "overlook[ing]" memoranda indicating that the Sri
            Lankan Government solicited and required AID's assistance to mitigate the effects of the
            Mahaweli project on endangered species, and that the Bureau of Reclamation was advising
            the Aswan project. Post, at 600-601. The memoranda, however, contain no indication
            whatever that the projects will cease or be less harmful to listed species in the
            absence of AID funding. In fact, the Sri Lanka memorandum suggests just the opposite: It
            states that AID's role will be to mitigate the "`negative impacts to the wildlife,' "
            post, at 600, which means that the termination of AID funding would exacerbate
            respondents' claimed injury.</p>
         <p>[7] There is this much truth to the assertion that "procedural rights" are special: The
            person who has been accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests can
            assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and
            immediacy. Thus, under our case law, one living adjacent to the site for proposed
            construction of a federally licensed dam has standing to challenge the licensing
            agency's failure to prepare an environmental impact statement, even though he cannot
            establish with any certainty that the statement will cause the license to be withheld or
            altered, and even though the dam will not be completed for many years. (That is why we
            do not rely, in the present case, upon the Government's argument that, even if the other
            agencies were obliged to consult with the Secretary, they might not have followed his
            advice.) What respondents' "procedural rights" argument seeks, however, is quite
            different from this: standing for persons who have no concrete interests
            affected&#x97;persons who live (and propose to live) at the other end of the country
            from the dam.</p>
         <p>[8] The dissent's discussion of this aspect of the case, post, at 601-606, distorts our
            opinion. We do not hold that an individual cannot enforce procedural rights; he
            assuredly can, so long as the procedures in question are designed to protect some
            threatened concrete interest of his that is the ultimate basis of his standing. The
            dissent, however, asserts that there exist "classes of procedural duties . . . so
            enmeshed with the prevention of a substantive, concrete harm that an individual
            plaintiff may be able to demonstrate a sufficient likelihood of injury just through the
            breach of that procedural duty." Post, at 605. If we understand this correctly, it means
            that the Government's violation of a certain (undescribed) class of procedural duty
            satisfies the concrete-injury requirement by itself, without any showing that the
            procedural violation endangers a concrete interest of the plaintiff (apart from his
            interest in having the procedure observed). We cannot agree. The dissent is unable to
            cite a single case in which we actually found standing solely on the basis of a
            "procedural right" unconnected to the plaintiff's own concrete harm. Its suggestion that
            we did so in Japan Whaling Assn. v. American Cetacean Soc., 478 U. S. 221 (1986), and
            Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U. S. 332 (1989), post, at 602-603,
            605, is not supported by the facts. In the former case, we found that the environmental
            organizations had standing because the "whale watching and studying of their members
            w[ould] be adversely affected by continued whale harvesting," see 478 U. S., at 230-231,
            n. 4; and in the latter we did not so much as mention standing, for the very good reason
            that the plaintiff was a citizens' council for the area in which the challenged
            construction was to occur, so that its members would obviously be concretely affected,
            see Methow Valley Citizens Council v. Regional Forester, 833 F. 2d 810, 812-813 (CA9
            1987).</p>
         <p>[1] See, e. g., Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 734 (1972); United States v.
            Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP), 412 U. S. 669, 686-687
            (1973); Japan Whaling Assn. v. American Cetacean Society, 478 U. S. 221, 230-231, n. 4
            (1986).</p>
         <p>[2] As we recognized in Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S., at 735, the impact of changes
            in the esthetics or ecology of a particular area does "not fall indiscriminately upon
            every citizen. The alleged injury will be felt directly only by those who use [the
            area,] and for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened .
            . . ." Thus, respondents would not be injured by the challenged projects if they had not
            visited the sites or studied the threatened species and habitat. But, as discussed
            above, respondents did visit the sites; moreover, they have expressed an intent to do so
            again. This intent to revisit the area is significant evidence tending to confirm the
            genuine character of respondents' interest, but I am not at all sure that an intent to
            revisit would be indispensable in every case. The interest that confers standing in a
            case of this kind is comparable, though by no means equivalent, to the interest in a
            relationship among family members that can be immediately harmed by the death of an
            absent member, regardless of when, if ever, a family reunion is planned to occur. Thus,
            if the facts of this case had shown repeated and regular visits by the respondents, cf.
            ante, at 579 (opinion of Kennedy, J.), proof of an intent to revisit might well be
            superfluous.</p>
         <p>[3] The ESA defines "Secretary" to mean "the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary
            of Commerce as program responsibilities are vested pursuant to the provisions of
            Reorganization Plan Numbered 4 of 1970." 16 U. S. C. § 1532(15). As a general matter,
            "marine species are under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Commerce and all other
            species are under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior." 51 Fed. Reg. 19926
            (1986) (preamble to final regulations governing interagency consultation promulgated by
            the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service on behalf of the
            Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce).</p>
         <p>[4] Respondents point out that the duties in § 7(a)(2) are phrased in broad, inclusive
            language: "Each Federal agency" shall consult with the Secretary and ensure that "any
            action" does not jeopardize "any endangered or threatened species" or destroy or
            adversely modify the "habitat of such species." See Brief for Respondents 36; 16 U. S.
            C. § 1536(a)(2). The Court of Appeals correctly recognized, however, that such inclusive
            language, by itself, is not sufficient to overcome the presumption against the
            extraterritorial application of statutes. 911 F. 2d 117, 122 (CA8 1990); see also Foley
            Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 282, 287-288 (1949) (statute requiring an 8-hour
            day provision in "`[e]very contract made to which the United States . . . is a party' "
            is inapplicable to contracts for work performed in foreign countries).</p>
         <p>[5] Section 7(a)(2) has two clauses which require federal agencies to consult with the
            Secretary to ensure that their actions (1) do not jeopardize threatened or endangered
            species (the "endangered species clause"), and (2) are not likely to destroy or
            adversely affect the habitat of such species (the "critical habitat clause").</p>
         <p>[6] Instead, the Court of Appeals concluded that the endangered species clause and the
            critical habitat clause are "severable," at least with respect to their "geographical
            scope," so that the former clause applies extraterritorially even if the latter does
            not. 911 F. 2d, at 125. Under this interpretation, federal agencies must consult with
            the Secretary to ensure that their actions in foreign countries are not likely to
            threaten any endangered species, but they need not consult to ensure that their actions
            are not likely to destroy the critical habitats of these species. I cannot subscribe to
            the Court of Appeals' strained interpretation, for there is no indication that Congress
            intended to give such vastly different scope to the two clauses in § 7(a)(2).</p>
         <p>[7] Of course, Congress also found that "the United States has pledged itself as a
            sovereign state in the international community to conserve to the extent practicable the
            various species of fish or wildlife and plants facing extinction, pursuant to [several
            international agreements]," and that "encouraging the States . . . to develop and
            maintain conservation programs which meet national and international standards is a key
            to meeting the Nation's international commitments . . . ." 16 U. S. C. §§ 1531(4), (5).
            The Court of Appeals read these findings as indicative of a congressional intent to make
            § 7(a)(2)'s consultation requirement applicable to agency action abroad. See 911 F. 2d,
            at 122-123. I am not persuaded, however, that such a broad congressional intent can be
            gleaned from these findings. Instead, I think the findings indicate a more narrow
            congressional intent that the United States abide by its international commitments.</p>
         <p>[1] The record is replete with genuine issues of fact about the harm to endangered
            species from the Aswan and Mahaweli projects. For example, according to an internal
            memorandum of the Fish and Wildlife Service, no fewer than eight listed species are
            found in the Mahaweli project area (Indian elephant, leopard, purple-faced langur, toque
            macaque, red face malkoha, Bengal monitor, mugger crocodile, and python). App. 78. The
            memorandum recounts that the Sri Lankan Government has specifically requested assistance
            from the Agency for International Development (AID) in "mitigating the negative impacts
            to the wildlife involved." Ibid. In addition, a letter from the Director of the Fish and
            Wildlife Service to AID warns: "The magnitude of the Accelerated Mahaweli Development
            Program could have massive environmental impacts on such an insular ecosystem as the
            Mahaweli River system." Id., at 215. It adds: "The Sri Lankan government lacks the
            necessary finances to undertake any long-term management programs to avoid the negative
            impacts to the wildlife." Id., at 216. Finally, in an affidavit submitted by petitioner
            for purposes of this litigation, an AID official states that an AID environmental
            assessment "showed that the [Mahaweli] project could affect several endangered species."
            Id., at 159.</p>
         <p>[2] This section provides in part: </p>
         <p>"(a) Requirement for formal consultation. Each Federal agency shall review its actions
            at the earliest possible time to determine whether any action may affect listed species
            or critical habitat. If such a determination is made, formal consultation is required .
            . . ." The Secretary's intent to make the regulations binding upon other agencies is
            even clearer from the discussion accompanying promulgation of the consultation rules.
            See 51 Fed. Reg. 19928 (1986) ("Several commenters stated that Congress did not intend
            that the Service interpret or implement section 7, and believed that the Service should
            recast the regulations as `nonbinding guidelines' that would govern only the Service's
            role in consultation . . . . The Service is satisfied that it has ample authority and
            legislative mandate to issue this rule, and believes that uniform consultation standards
            and procedures are necessary to meet its obligations under section 7").</p>
         <p>[3] For example, petitioner's motion before the District Court to dismiss the complaint
            identified four attorneys from the Department of State and AID (an agency of the
            Department of State) as "counsel" to the attorneys from the Justice Department in this
            action. One AID lawyer actually entered a formal appearance before the District Court on
            behalf of AID. On at least one occasion petitioner requested an extension of time to
            file a brief, representing that "`[a]n extension is necessary for the Department of
            Justice to consult with . . .the Department of State [on] the brief.' " See Brief for
            Respondents 31, n. 8. In addition, AID officials have offered testimony in this
            action.</p>
         <p>[4] The plurality now suggests that collateral-estoppel principles can have no
            application here, because the participation of other agencies in this litigation arose
            after its inception. Borrowing a principle from this Court's statutory diversity
            jurisdiction cases and transferring it to the constitutional standing context, the Court
            observes: "`The existence of federal jurisdiction ordinarily depends on the facts as
            they exist when the complaint is filed .' " Ante, at 569, n. 4 (quoting Newman-Green,
            Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, 490 U. S. 826, 830 (1989)). See also Mollan v. Torrance, <span
               class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/roY/mollan-v-torrance/">
                  <span class="volume">9</span>
                  <span class="reporter">Wheat.</span>
                  <span class="page">537</span>
               </a>
            </span>, 539 (1824) (Marshall, C. J.). The plurality proclaims that "[i]t cannot be"
            that later participation of other agencies in this suit retroactively created a
            jurisdictional issue that did not exist at the outset. Ante, at 570, n. 4. </p>
         <p>The plurality, however, overlooks at least three difficulties with this explanation. In
            the first place, assuming that the plurality were correct that events as of the
            initiation of the lawsuit are the only proper jurisdictional reference point, were the
            Court to follow this rule in this case there would be no question as to the compliance
            of other agencies, because, as stated at an earlier point in the opinion: "When the
            Secretary promulgated the regulation at issue here, he thought it was binding on the
            agencies." Ante, at 569. This suit was commenced in October 1986, just three months
            after the regulation took effect. App. 21; 51 Fed. Reg. 19926 (1986). As the plurality
            further admits, questions about compliance of other agencies with the Secretary's
            regulation arose only by later participation of the Solicitor General and other agencies
            in the suit. Ante, at 569. Thus, it was, to borrow the plurality's own words, "assuredly
            not true when this suit was filed, naming the Secretary alone," ante, at 569, n. 4, that
            there was any question before the District Court about other agencies being bound.</p>
         <p>Second, were the plurality correct that, for purposes of determining redressability, a
            court may look only to facts as they exist when the complaint is filed, then the Court
            by implication would render a nullity part of Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil
            Procedure. Rule 19 provides in part for the joinder of persons if "in the person's
            absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties." This
            presupposes nonredressability at the outset of the litigation. Under the plurality's
            rationale, a district court would have no authority to join indispensable parties,
            because it would, as an initial matter, have no jurisdiction for lack of the power to
            provide redress at the outset of the litigation.</p>
         <p>Third, the rule articulated in Newman-Green is that the existence of federal
            jurisdiction "ordinarily " depends on the facts at the initiation of the lawsuit. This
            is no ironclad per se rule without exceptions. Had the Solicitor General, for example,
            taken a position during this appeal that the § 7 consultation requirement does in fact
            apply extraterritorially, the controversy would be moot, and this Court would be without
            jurisdiction.</p>
         <p>In the plurality's view, federal subject-matter jurisdiction appears to be a one-way
            street running the Executive Branch's way. When the Executive Branch wants to dispel
            jurisdiction over an action against an agency, it is free to raise at any point in the
            litigation that other nonparty agencies might not be bound by any determinations of the
            one agency defendant. When a plaintiff, however, seeks to preserve jurisdiction in the
            face of a claim of nonredressability, the plaintiff is not free to point to the
            involvement of nonparty agencies in subsequent parts of the litigation. The plurality
            does not explain why the street runs only one way&#x97;why some actions of the Executive
            Branch subsequent to initiation of a lawsuit are cognizable for jurisdictional purposes
            but others simply are not.</p>
         <p>More troubling still is the distance this one-way street carries the plurality from the
            underlying purpose of the standing doctrine. The purpose of the standing doctrine is to
            ensure that courts do not render advisory opinions rather than resolve genuine
            controversies between adverse parties. Under the plurality's analysis, the federal
            courts are to ignore their present ability to resolve a concrete controversy if at some
            distant point in the past it could be said that redress could not have been provided.
            The plurality perverts the standing inquiry.</p>
