         <p>Joseph H. Rodriguez and Michael L. Perlin filed a brief for the New Jersey Department of
            the Public Advocate as amicus curiae urging affirmance.</p>
         <p>JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
         <p>A municipal ordinance of the city of Camden, New Jersey, requires that at least 40% of
            the employees of contractors and subcontractors working on city construction projects be
            Camden residents. Appellant, the United Building and Construction Trades Council of
            Camden County and Vicinity (Council), challenges that ordinance as a violation of the
            Privileges and Immunities Clause, Art. IV, ยง 2, cl. 1, of the United States
               Constitution.<span class="sup">[1]</span> The Supreme Court of New Jersey rejected
            appellant's privileges and immunities attack on the ground that the ordinance
            discriminates on the basis of municipal, not state, residency. The court "decline[d] to
            apply the Privileges and Immunities Clause in the context of a municipal ordinance that
            has identical effects upon out-of-state citizens and New Jersey citizens not residing in
            the locality." 88 N. J. 317, 342, 443 A. 2d 148, 160 (1982). We conclude that the
            challenged ordinance is properly subject to the strictures of the Clause. We therefore
            reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey and remand the case for a
            determination of the validity of the ordinance under the appropriate constitutional
            standard.</p>
         <p>On August 28, 1980, the Camden City Council, acting pursuant to a statewide
            affirmative-action program,<span class="sup">[2]</span> adopted an <span
               class="star-pagination">*211</span> ordinance setting minority hiring "goals" on all
            public works contracts. Ordinance MC 1650, App. to Juris. Statement A36. The ordinance
            also created a hiring preference for Camden residents, with a separate 1-year residency
            requirement triggering eligibility for that preference. Ordinance MC 1650 ยง I(5), App.
            to Juris. Statement A38. As subsequently amended, the ordinance requires that on all
            construction projects funded by the city:<span class="sup">[3]</span>
         </p> "The developer/contractor, in hiring for jobs, shall make every effort to employ
         persons residing within the City of Camden but, in no event, shall less than forty percent
         (40%) of the entire labor force be residents of the City of Camden." Ordinance MC 1653 ยง
         C(IV)(b), App. to Juris. Statement A56. <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*212</span> The contractor is also obliged to ensure that
            any subcontractors working on such projects adhere to the same requirement. Ordinance MC
            1650 ยง VIII, App. to Juris. Statement A46.</p>
         <p>The amended ordinance was submitted for approval to the Chief Affirmative Action Officer
            of the New Jersey Treasury Department in November 1980. Following brief administrative
            proceedings, the ordinance was designated as a state-approved affirmative-action
            construction program. Appellant, an association of labor organizations representing
            private employees in the building and construction trades in various New Jersey
               counties,<span class="sup">[4]</span> filed a notice of appeal with the Appellate
            Division of the New Jersey Superior Court challenging the final determination of the
            Treasury Department in approving the Camden plan. The New Jersey Supreme Court certified
            the appeal directly to that court to decide all the issues in the case.</p>
         <p>Appellant challenged state approval of the resident-hiring quota as ultra vires, and as
            unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause of
            Art. IV of the United States Constitution and under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal
            Protection Clause.<span class="sup">[5]</span> The New Jersey court sustained the
            Treasurer's action as consistent both with state law and the Federal Constitution.
            Citing Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429 (1980), and Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap
            Corp., 426 U. S. 794 (1976), the court held that the resident quota was not subject to
            challenge under the Commerce Clause because the State was acting as a market participant
            rather than as a market regulator. 88 <span class="star-pagination">*213</span> N. J.,
            at 338-341, 443 A. 2d, at 158-160. The court also held that the quota did not violate
            the Privileges and Immunities Clause because it was not aimed primarily at out-of-state
            residents. "It almost certainly affects more New Jersey residents not living in Camden
            than it does out-of-state residents. Because the Camden ordinance does not affect `the
            States['] . . . treatment of each other's residents,' . . . it does not violate any
            privilege of state citizenship." Id., at 341-342, 443 A. 2d, at 160. Finally, the New
            Jersey Supreme Court held that the 1-year residency requirement did not violate the
            right to travel protected by the Equal Protection Clause, concluding that only a
            rational basis is required to uphold a residency requirement for city employment. Id.,
            at 342-343, 443 A. 2d, at 160-161.</p>
         <p>Appellant then filed this appeal raising the same three constitutional challenges to the
            resident-hiring quota. We noted probable jurisdiction. 460 U. S. 1021 (1983). Since the
            Council filed its appeal, however, there have been two significant changes in the
            posture of the case. First, the Court decided White v. Massachusetts Council of
            Construction Employers, Inc., 460 U. S. 204 (1983), which held that an executive order
            of the Mayor of Boston, requiring that at least 50% of all jobs on construction projects
            funded in whole or in part by city funds be filled by bona fide city residents, was
            immune from scrutiny under the Commerce Clause because Boston was acting as a market
            participant rather than as a market regular. In light of the decision in White,
            appellant has abandoned its Commerce Clause challenge to the Camden ordinance.</p>
         <p>Second, in July 1983 Camden amended its affirmative-action plan. The 1-year residency
            requirement was deleted, thereby mooting appellant's equal protection challenge based on
            that durational requirement. Now, a resident of the city of Camden is defined simply as
            "any person who resides in the City of Camden." App. to Brief for Appellees Mayor and
            Council of the City of Camden A-5. Also, the scope of <span class="star-pagination"
               >*214</span> the ordinance was clarified.<span class="sup">[6]</span> It now applies
            to any construction project "which is funded in whole or in part with City funds or
            funds which the City expends or administers in accordance with the terms of a grant."
            Id., at A-4. Finally, the 40% resident-hiring requirement was changed from a strict
            "quota" to a "goal" with which developers and contractors must make "every good faith
            effort" to comply. Id., at A-13.</p>
         <p>Because of these changes, the only question left for our consideration is whether the
            Camden ordinance, as now written, violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause.<span
               class="sup">[7]</span> We first address the argument, accepted by the Supreme Court
            of New Jersey, that the Clause does not even apply to a municipal ordinance such as
            this. Two separate contentions are advanced in support of this position: first, that the
            Clause only applies to laws passed by a State and, second, that the Clause only applies
            to laws that discriminate on the basis of state citizenship.</p>
         <p>The first argument can be quickly rejected. The fact that the ordinance in question is a
            municipal, rather than a state, law does not somehow place it outside the scope of the
            Privileges and Immunities Clause. First of all, one cannot easily distinguish municipal
            from state action in this case: the municipal ordinance would not have gone into effect
            without express approval by the State Treasurer. As the New Jersey Supreme Court noted
            in discussing the constitutionality of the minority hiring goals:</p> "By approving the
         Camden plan, the State Treasurer has established a minority hiring goal for the City of
         Camden that operates no differently than every other minority hiring goal established by
         the State Treasurer. <span class="star-pagination">*215</span>. . . The Council's
         constitutional challenge to the Camden minority hiring goal must therefore be interpreted
         as a challenge to the State Treasurer's general power to issue affirmative action hiring
         goals." 88 N. J., at 330, 443 A. 2d, at 154. <p>The constitutional challenge to the
            resident hiring preference, therefore, must also "be interpreted as a challenge to the
            State Treasurer's general power" to adopt such a preference.<span class="sup">[8]</span>
            The New Jersey court specifically found that the State Treasurer's approval of the
            resident-hiring preference was "not ultra vires or an abuse of discretion." Id., at 329,
            443 A. 2d, at 154.</p>
         <p>More fundamentally, a municipality is merely a political subdivision of the State from
            which its authority derives. Trenton v. New Jersey, 262 U. S. 182, 187 (1923). It is as
            true of the Privileges and Immunities Clause as of the Equal Protection Clause that what
            would be unconstitutional if done directly by the State can no more readily be
            accomplished by a city deriving its authority from the State. Memorial Hospital v.
            Maricopa County, 415 U. S. 250, 256 (1974); Avery v. Midland County, 390 U. S. 474,
            480-481 (1968). Thus, even if the ordinance had been adopted solely by Camden, and not
            pursuant to a state program or with state approval, the hiring preference would still
            have to comport with the Privileges and Immunities Clause.</p>
         <p>The second argument merits more consideration. The New Jersey Supreme Court concluded
            that the Privileges and Immunities Clause does not apply to an ordinance that
            discriminates solely on the basis of municipal residency. The Clause is phrased in terms
            of state citizenship and was designed "to place the citizens of each State upon the same
            footing with citizens of other States, so far as the advantages <span
               class="star-pagination">*216</span> resulting from citizenship in those States are
            concerned." Paul v. Virginia, <span class="citation">

            </span>, 180 (1869). See also Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437 U. S. 518, 523-524 (1978); Ward v.
            Maryland, <span class="citation">

               </a>
            </span>, 430 (1871).</p> "The primary purpose of this clause, like the clauses between
         which it is located &#x97; those relating to full faith and credit and to interstate
         extradition of fugitives from justice &#x97; was to help fuse into one Nation a collection
         of independent, sovereign States. It was designed to insure to a citizen of State A who
         ventures into State B the same privileges which the citizens of State B enjoy. For
         protection of such equality the citizen of State A was not to be restricted to the
         uncertain remedies afforded by diplomatic processes and official retaliation." Toomer v.
         Witsell, 334 U. S. 385, 395 (1948) (footnote omitted). <p>Municipal residency
            classifications, it is argued, simply do not give rise to the same concerns.</p>
         <p>We cannot accept this argument. We have never read the Clause so literally as to apply
            it only to distinctions based on state citizenship. For example, in Mullaney v.
            Anderson, 342 U. S. 415, 419-420 (1952), the Court held that the Alaska Territory had no
            more freedom to discriminate against those not residing in the Territory than did any
            State to favor its own citizens. And despite some initial uncertainty, compare Travis v.
            Yale &amp;amp; Towne Mfg. Co., 252 U. S. 60, 78-79 (1920), and Blake v. McClung, 172 U.
            S. 239, 246-247 (1898), with Douglas v. New York, N. H. &amp;amp; H. R. Co., 279 U. S.
            377, 386-387 (1929), and La Tourette v. McMaster, 248 U. S. 465, 469-470 (1919), it is
            now established that the terms "citizen" and "resident" are "essentially
            interchangeable," Austin v. New Hampshire, 420 U. S. 656, 662, n. 8 (1975), for purposes
            of analysis of most cases under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. See Hicklin v.
            Orbeck, supra, at 524, n. 8; Toomer v. Witsell, supra, at 397. A person who is not
            residing in a given State is ipso facto not residing in a city within that <span
               class="star-pagination">*217</span> State. Thus, whether the exercise of a privilege
            is conditioned on state residency or on municipal residency he will just as surely be
            excluded.</p>
         <p>Given the Camden ordinance, an out-of-state citizen who ventures into New Jersey will
            not enjoy the same privileges as the New Jersey citizen residing in Camden. It is true
            that New Jersey citizens not residing in Camden will be affected by the ordinance as
            well as out-of-state citizens. And it is true that the disadvantaged New Jersey
            residents have no claim under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Slaughter-House
            Cases, <span class="citation no-link">

               <span class="page">36</span>
            </span>, 77 (1873). But New Jersey residents at least have a chance to remedy at the
            polls any discrimination against them. Out-of-state citizens have no similar
            opportunity, Austin v. New Hampshire, supra, at 662, and they must not "be restricted to
            the uncertain remedies afforded by diplomatic processes and official retaliation."
            Toomer v. Witsell, supra, at 395.<span class="sup">[9]</span> We conclude that Camden's
               <span class="star-pagination">*218</span> ordinance is not immune from constitutional
            review at the behest of out-of-state residents merely because some in-state residents
            are similarly disadvantaged. Cf. Zobel v. Williams, 457 U. S. 55, 75 (1982) (O'CONNOR,
            J., concurring in judgment).</p>
         <p>Application of the Privileges and Immunities Clause to a particular instance of
            discrimination against out-of-state residents entails a two-step inquiry. As an initial
            matter, the Court must decide whether the ordinance burdens one of those privileges and
            immunities protected by the Clause. Baldwin v. Montana Fish and Game Comm'n, 436 U. S.
            371, 383 (1978). Not all forms of discrimination against citizens of other States are
            constitutionally suspect.</p> "Some distinctions between residents and nonresidents
         merely reflect the fact that this is a Nation composed of individual States, and are
         permitted; other distinctions are prohibited because they hinder the formation, the
         purpose, or the development of a single Union of those States. Only with respect to those
         `privileges' and `immunities' bearing upon the vitality of the Nation as a single entity
         must the State treat all citizens, resident and nonresident, equally." Ibid. <p>As a
            threshold matter, then, we must determine whether an out-of-state resident's interest in
            employment on public works contracts in another State is sufficiently "fundamental" to
            the promotion of interstate harmony so as to "fall within the purview of the Privileges

         <p>Certainly, the pursuit of a common calling is one of the most fundamental of those
            privileges protected by the Clause. Baldwin v. Montana Fish and Game Comm'n, supra, at
            387. Many, if not most, of our cases expounding the Privileges and Immunities Clause
            have dealt with this basic and essential activity. See, e. g., Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437 U.
            S. 518 (1978); Austin v. New Hampshire, 420 U. S. 656 (1975); Mullaney v. Anderson, 342

            </span> (1871). Public employment, however, is qualitatively different from employment
            in the private sector; it is a subspecies of the broader opportunity to pursue a common
            calling. We have held that there is no fundamental right to government employment for
            purposes of the Equal Protection Clause. Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427
            U. S. 307, 313 (1976) (per curiam). Cf. McCarthy v. Philadelphia Civil Service Comm'n,
            424 U. S. 645 (1976) (per curiam) (rejecting equal protection challenge to municipal
            residency requirement for municipal workers). And in White, 460 U. S., at 211, n. 7, we
            held that for purposes of the Commerce Clause everyone employed on a city public works
            project is, "in a substantial if informal sense, `working for the city.' "</p>
         <p>It can certainly be argued that for purposes of the Privileges and Immunities Clause
            everyone affected by the Camden ordinance is also "working for the city" and, therefore,
            has no grounds for complaint when the city favors its own residents. But we decline to
            transfer mechanically into this context an analysis fashioned to fit the Commerce
            Clause. Our decision in White turned on a distinction between the city acting as a
            market participant and the city acting as a market regulator. The question whether
            employees of contractors and subcontractors on public works projects were or were not,
            in some sense, working for the city was crucial to that analysis. The question had to be
            answered in order to chart the boundaries of the distinction. But the distinction
            between <span class="star-pagination">*220</span> market participant and market
            regulator relied upon in White to dispose of the Commerce Clause challenge is not
            dispositive in this context. The two Clauses have different aims and set different
            standards for state conduct.</p>
         <p>The Commerce Clause acts as an implied restraint upon state regulatory powers. Such
            powers must give way before the superior authority of Congress to legislate on (or leave
            unregulated) matters involving interstate commerce. When the State acts solely as a
            market participant, no conflict between state regulation and federal regulatory
            authority can arise. White, supra, at 206-208; Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S., at
            436-437; Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S., at 810. The Privileges and
            Immunities Clause, on the other hand, imposes a direct restraint on state action in the
            interests of interstate harmony. Hicklin v. Orbeck, supra, at 523-524; Ward v. Maryland,
            supra, at 430; Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall., at 180. This concern with comity cuts across
            the market regulator-market participant distinction that is crucial under the Commerce
            Clause. It is discrimination against out-of-state residents on matters of fundamental
            concern which triggers the Clause, not regulation affecting inter-state commerce. Thus,
            the fact that Camden is merely setting conditions on its expenditures for goods and
            services in the marketplace does not preclude the possibility that those conditions
            violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause.</p>
         <p>In Hicklin v. Orbeck, supra, we struck down as a violation of the Privileges and
            Immunities Clause an "Alaska Hire" statute containing a resident-hiring preference for
            all employment related to the development of the State's oil and gas resources.<span
               class="sup">[10]</span> Alaska argued in that case that "because the oil and gas that
            are the subject of Alaska Hire are owned <span class="star-pagination">*221</span> by
            the State, this ownership, of itself, is sufficient justification for the Act's
            discrimination against nonresidents, and takes the Act totally without the scope of the
            Privileges and Immunities Clause." Id., at 528 (footnote omitted). We concluded,
            however, that the State's interest in controlling those things it claims to own is not
            absolute. "Rather than placing a statute completely beyond the Clause, a State's
            ownership of the property with which the statute is concerned is a factor &#x97;
            although often the crucial factor &#x97; to be considered in evaluating whether the
            statute's discrimination against noncitizens violates the Clause." Id., at 529. See also
            Baldwin v. Montana Fish and Game Comm'n, 436 U. S., at 385. Much the same analysis, we
            think, is appropriate to a city's efforts to bias private employment decisions in favor
            of its residents on construction projects funded with public moneys. The fact that
            Camden is expending its own funds or funds it administers in accordance with the terms
            of a grant is certainly a factor &#x97; perhaps the crucial factor &#x97; to be
            considered in evaluating whether the statute's discrimination violates the Privileges
            and Immunities Clause. But it does not remove the Camden ordinance completely from the
            purview of the Clause.</p>
         <p>In sum, Camden may, without fear of violating the Commerce Clause, pressure private
            employers engaged in public works projects funded in whole or in part by the city to
            hire city residents. But that same exercise of power to bias the employment decisions of
            private contractors and sub-contractors against out-of-state residents may be called to
            account under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. A determination of whether a
            privilege is "fundamental" for purposes of that Clause does not depend on whether the
            employees of private contractors and subcontractors engaged in public works projects can
            or cannot be said to be "working for the city." The opportunity to seek employment with
            such private employers is "sufficiently basic to the livelihood of the Nation," Baldwin
            v. Montana Fish and Game Comm'n, supra, at 388, as to fall within the purview of the
            Privileges <span class="star-pagination">*222</span> and Immunities Clause even though
            the contractors and sub-contractors are themselves engaged in projects funded in whole
            or part by the city.</p>
         <p>The conclusion that Camden's ordinance discriminates against a protected privilege does
            not, of course, end the inquiry. We have stressed in prior cases that "[l]ike many other
            constitutional provisions, the privileges and immunities clause is not an absolute."
            Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S., at 396. It does not preclude discrimination against
            citizens of other States where there is a "substantial reason" for the difference in
            treatment. "[T]he inquiry in each case must be concerned with whether such reasons do
            exist and whether the degree of discrimination bears a close relation to them." Ibid. As
            part of any justification offered for the discriminatory law, nonresidents must somehow
            be shown to "constitute a peculiar source of the evil at which the statute is aimed."
            Id., at 398.</p>
         <p>The city of Camden contends that its ordinance is necessary to counteract grave economic
            and social ills. Spiralling unemployment, a sharp decline in population, and a dramatic
            reduction in the number of businesses located in the city have eroded property values
            and depleted the city's tax base. The resident-hiring preference is designed, the city
            contends, to increase the number of employed persons living in Camden and to arrest the
            "middle-class flight" currently plaguing the city. The city also argues that all
            non-Camden residents employed on city public works projects, whether they reside in New
            Jersey or Pennsylvania, constitute a "source of the evil at which the statute is aimed."
            That is, they "live off" Camden without "living in" Camden. Camden contends that the
            scope of the discrimination practiced in the ordinance, with its municipal residency
            requirement, is carefully tailored to alleviate this evil without unreasonably harming
            nonresidents, who still have access to 60% of the available positions.</p>
         <p>Every inquiry under the Privileges and Immunities Clause "must . . . be conducted with
            due regard for the principle that <span class="star-pagination">*223</span> the States
            should have considerable leeway in analyzing local evils and in prescribing appropriate
            cures." Toomer v. Witsell, supra, at 396. This caution is particularly appropriate when
            a government body is merely setting conditions on the expenditure of funds it controls.
            See supra, at 221. The Alaska Hire statute at issue in Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437 U. S. 518
            (1978), swept within its strictures not only contractors and subcontractors dealing
            directly with the State's oil and gas; it also covered suppliers who provided goods and
            services to those contractors and subcontractors. We invalidated the Act as "an attempt
            to force virtually all businesses that benefit in some way from the economic ripple
            effect of Alaska's decision to develop its oil and gas resources to bias their
            employment practices in favor of the State's residents." Id., at 531. No similar "ripple
            effect" appears to infect the Camden ordinance. It is limited in scope to employees
            working directly on city public works projects.</p>
         <p>Nonetheless, we find it impossible to evaluate Camden's justification on the record as
            it now stands. No trial has ever been held in the case. No findings of fact have been
            made. The Supreme Court of New Jersey certified the case for direct appeal after the
            brief administrative proceedings that led to approval of the ordinance by the State
            Treasurer. It would not be appropriate for this Court either to make factual
            determinations as an initial matter or to take judicial notice of Camden's decay. We,
            therefore, deem it wise to remand the case to the New Jersey Supreme Court. That court
            may decide, consistent with state procedures, on the best method for making the
            necessary findings.</p>
         <p>The judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey is reversed, and the case is remanded
            for proceedings not in-consistent with this opinion.</p>
         <p>It is so ordered.</p></div>

         <p>Today, however, the Court casually extends the scope of the Clause by holding that it
            applies to laws that discriminate among state residents on the basis of municipal
            residence, simply because discrimination on the basis of municipal residence
            disadvantages citizens of other States "ipso facto." Ante, at 216-217. This novel
            interpretation arrives accompanied by little practical justification and no historical
            or textual support whatsoever. Because I believe that the Privileges and Immunities
            Clause was not intended to apply to the kind of municipal discrimination presented by
            this case, I would affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey.<span

         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>The historical underpinnings of the Privileges and Immunities Clause are not in serious
            dispute. The Clause was derived from the fourth Article of Confederation<span
               class="sup">[4]</span> and was <span class="star-pagination">*225</span> designed to
            carry forward that provision's prescription of interstate comity. Austin v. New
            Hampshire, 420 U. S. 656, 660-661 (1975); United States v. Wheeler, 254 U. S. 281, 294
            (1920); Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall., at 75. Both the text of the Clause and the
            historical record confirm that the Framers meant to foreclose any one State from denying
            citizens of other States the same "privileges and immunities" accorded its own citizens.
            See Austin v. New Hampshire, 420 U. S., at 660-661. James Madison complained during the
            Constitutional Convention of "Acts of Virga. &amp;amp; Maryland which give a preference
            to their own citizens in cases where the Citizens [of other States] are entitled to
            equality of privileges by the Articles of Confederation."<span class="sup">[5]</span>
            Alexander Hamilton, who deemed the Privileges and Immunities Clause "the basis of the
            Union," The Federalist No. 80, p. 502 (B. Wright ed. 1961), expressly linked the Clause
            with the concern over state parochialism that gave rise to the federal courts' diversity
            jurisdiction under Article III:</p> "[I]n order to [ensure] the inviolable maintenance
         of that equality of privileges and immunities to which the citizens of the Union will be
         entitled, the national judiciary ought to preside in all cases in which one State or its
         citizens are opposed to another State or its citizens. To secure the full effect of so
         fundamental a provision against all evasion and subterfuge, it is necessary that its
         construction should be committed to that tribunal which, having no local attachments, will
         be likely to be impartial <span class="star-pagination">*226</span> between the different
         States and their citizens . . . ." Ibid. <p>While the Framers thus conceived of the
            Privileges and Immunities Clause as an instrument for frustrating discrimination based
            on state citizenship, there is no evidence of any sort that they were concerned by
            intrastate discrimination based on municipal residence. The most obvious reason for this
            is also the most simple one: by the time the Constitution was enacted, such
            discrimination was rarely practiced and even more rarely successful.<span class="sup"
               >[6]</span> Even had attempts to practice the kind of economic localism at issue here
            been more widespread, moreover, there is little reason to believe that the Framers would
            have devoted their limited institutional resources to bringing such conduct within the
            ambit of the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Whatever the weaknesses of the new state
            governments in suppressing sectional conflicts that gave rise to outright physical
            violence, like Shays' Rebellion in 1786-1787, the States had more than adequate powers
            to prevent localities from disrupting the States' internal economic affairs through
            discriminatory ordinances and regulations. By the time the Constitution was adopted,
            most state legislatures had assumed the power to grant and alter municipal charters and
            the power to legislate with respect to municipal affairs.<span class="sup">[7]</span>
            Even before the Revolution, the colonial legislatures had shown themselves willing and
            able to exercise this authority to override local protectionist ordinances. In 1746, for
            example, the New York Assembly dismantled a cartel of New York City lawyers by requiring
            the city to open its Mayor's Court to qualified lawyers from <span
               class="star-pagination">*227</span> throughout the colony.<span class="sup"
               >[8]</span> As a result, the Framers had every reason to believe that intrastate
            discrimination based on municipal residence could and would be dealt with by the States
            themselves in those instances where it persisted.<span class="sup">[9]</span>
         </p>
         <p>In light of the historical context in which the Privileges and Immunities Clause was
            adopted, it hardly is surprising that none of this Court's intervening decisions has
            suggested that the Clause applies to discrimination on the basis of municipal residence.
            To the contrary, while the Court never has addressed the question directly,<span
               class="sup">[10]</span> it repeatedly has proceeded on the assumption that the
            "Privileges and Immunities of Citizens" to which the Clause refers are entitlements held
            equally by all citizens of a State. Thus, in Paul v. Virginia, <span
               class="star-pagination">*228</span> supra, the Court stated that the Clause
            safeguards the enjoyment of "those privileges and immunities which are common to the
            citizens [in a State] under their constitution and laws by virtue of their being
            citizens." 8 Wall., at 180. In Blake v. McClung, 172 U. S. 239 (1898), the Court
            condemned a Tennessee statute that granted a priority to resident creditors over
            nonresident creditors on the assumption that the State's rules governing debtor-creditor
            relations "will be applied by its courts in all appropriate cases between citizens of
            that State, without making any distinction between them." Id., at 254 (emphasis in
            original). In Travellers' Insurance Co. v. Connecticut, 185 U. S. 364 (1902), the Court
            rejected a Privileges and Immunities Clause challenge to a Connecticut statute that
            taxed nonresident stockholders at a nominally higher rate than resident stockholders, on
            the ground that the direct differential was roughly offset by municipal taxes paid only
            by residents. The Court recognized that the burden borne by nonresidents might exceed
            that borne by residents in a particular year, but pointed out that "a like inequality
            will exist between residents of different localities in the State by reason of the
            different rates of taxation in those localities"; the disparate burden was permissible
            under these circumstances because "[y]ou cannot put one resident against one
            non-resident stockholder and by a comparison of their different burdens determine the
            validity of the legislation any more than you can place a stockholder resident in one
            municipality over against a stockholder resident in another municipality, and by
            comparison of their different burdens determine the validity of the tax law in respect
            to resident stockholders." Id., at 369 (emphasis added). In each case, the underlying
            assumption has been that the constitutionality vel non of a particular statute under the
            Privileges and Immunities Clause turns on whether the statute deprives nonresidents of
            benefits enjoyed in common by state residents by virtue of their residence
            simpliciter.</p>
         <p>Indeed, I had understood the Court to have reaffirmed this principle only two Terms ago
            in Zobel v. Williams, 457 U. S. <span class="star-pagination">*229</span> 55 (1982). In
            Zobel, the Court held that an Alaska statute which allocated state treasury refunds to
            state residents on the basis of the length of their residence violated the Equal
            Protection Clause. The Court declined, however, to hold that the statute violated the
            Privileges and Immunities Clause. It observed that the statute "does not simply make
            distinctions between native-born Alaskans and those who migrate to Alaska from other
            states;" instead, it "also discriminates among long-time residents and even native-born
            residents." 457 U. S., at 59, n. 5. As a result:</p> "The statute does not involve the
         kind of discrimination which the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. IV was designed
         to prevent. That Clause `was designed to insure to a citizen of State A who ventures into
         State B the same privileges which the citizens of State B enjoy.' Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U.
         S. 385, 395 (1948). The Clause is thus not applicable to this case." Id., at 60, n. 5. <p>I
            am somewhat at a loss to understand how the Court's decision today can be reconciled
            with its reasoning in Zobel.<span class="sup">[11]</span> The Alaska statute at issue in
            Zobel fell outside the scope of <span class="star-pagination">*230</span> the Privileges
            and Immunities Clause for the elementary reason that it did not discriminate between
            state residents and nonresidents on the basis of state residence; rather, it
            discriminated among state residents in a way that disadvantaged nonresidents as well but
            did not thereby implicate the underlying concerns of the Privileges and Immunities
            Clause. The Camden ordinance presently before the Court occupies precisely the same
            position.</p>
         <p>The Court's decision clashes with other Privileges and Immunities Clause precedents as
            well. The Court recognizes, as it must, that the Privileges and Immunities Clause does
            not afford state residents any protection against their own State's laws. See, e. g.,
            Bradwell v. Illinois, <span class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">16</span>
               <span class="reporter">Wall.</span>

            </span>, 138 (1873); Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall., at 77. When this settled rule is
            combined with the Court's newly fashioned rule concerning municipal discrimination,
            however, it has the perverse effect of vesting non-New Jersey residents with
            constitutional privileges that are not enjoyed by most New Jersey residents themselves.
            This result is directly contrary to the Court's longstanding position that the
            Privileges and Immunities Clause does not give nonresidents "higher and greater
            privileges than are enjoyed by the citizens of the state itself." Bank of Augusta v.

            Osborne, 135 U. S. 492, 498 (1890). When judicial alchemy transmutes gold into lead in
            this fashion, it is time for the Court to reexamine its reasoning.</p>
         <p>Finally, the Court fails to attend to the functional considerations that underlie the
            Privileges and Immunities Clause. The Clause has been a necessary limitation on state
            autonomy not simply because of the self-interest of individual States, but because state
            parochialism is likely to go un-checked by state political processes when those who are
            disadvantaged are by definition disenfranchised as well. The Clause remedies this
            breakdown in the representative process by requiring state residents to bear the same
            burdens that they choose to place on nonresidents; "by constitutionally <span
               class="star-pagination">*231</span> tying the fate of outsiders to the fate of those
            possessing political power, the framers insured that their interests would be well
            looked after." J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust 83 (1980). As a practical matter,
            therefore, the scope of the Clause may be measured by asking whether failure to link the
            interests of those who are disadvantaged with the interests of those who are preferred
            will consign the former group to "the uncertain remedies afforded by diplomatic
            processes and official retaliation." Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S., at 395; see Austin v.
            New Hampshire, 420 U. S., at 662.</p>
         <p>Contrary to the Court's tacit assumption, discrimination on the basis of municipal
            residence is substantially different in this regard from discrimination on the basis of
            state citizenship. The distinction is simple but fundamental: discrimination on the
            basis of municipal residence penalizes persons within the State's political community as
            well as those without. The Court itself points out that while New Jersey citizens who
            reside outside Camden are not protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause, they
            may resort to the State's political processes to protect themselves. Ante, at 217. What
            the Court fails to appreciate is that this avenue of relief for New Jersey residents
            works to protect residents of other States as well; disadvantaged state residents who
            turn to the state legislature to displace ordinances like Camden's further the interests
            of nonresidents as well as their own.<span class="sup">[12]</span>
            <span class="star-pagination">*232</span> Nor is this mechanism for relief merely a
            theoretical one; in the past decade several States, including California and Georgia,
            have repealed or forbidden protectionist ordinances like the one at issue here.<span
               class="sup">[13]</span> In short, discrimination on the basis of municipal residence
            simply does not consign residents of other States, in the words of Toomer, supra, to
            "the uncertain remedies afforded by diplomatic processes and official retaliation." The
            Court thus has applied the Privileges and Immunities Clause without regard for the
            political ills that it was designed to cure.<span class="sup">[14]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*233</span> It still might be possible to redeem the
            Court's decision if it were compelled by the language of the Privileges and Immunities
            Clause. The Court itself, however, concedes that its interpretation of the Clause does
            not attach readily to a constitutional provision phrased solely in terms of state
            citizenship. Ante, at 216. The Court seeks to defend its excursion beyond the frontiers
            of the constitutional language on the ground that it never has read the Privileges and
            Immunities Clause literally to apply only to classifications based on state citizenship.
            Ibid. The examples it cites, however, are hardly compelling support. Mullaney v.
            Anderson, 342 U. S. 415 (1952), held not that the Privileges and Immunities Clause
            applies ex proprio vigore to discrimination by a territorial legislature based on
            territorial residence, but rather that Congress had made the Privileges and Immunities
            Clause applicable to the Territory of Alaska by statute. See 342 U. S., at 419-420.<span
               class="sup">[15]</span> See also Haavik v. Alaska Packers <span
               class="star-pagination">*234</span> Assn., 263 U. S. 510, 515 (1924). Even if
            Mullaney v. Anderson set forth the proposition for which it is cited, moreover, the
            practical similarity between discrimination based on territorial residence and
            discrimination based on state residence has no parallel here. Similarly, while the Court
            unquestionably has come to treat the terms "citizen" and "resident" in this area as
            "essentially interchangeable," Austin v. New Hampshire, 420 U. S., at 662, n. 8, it has
            done so not out of a general disregard for the Constitution's language, but rather
            because the practical relationship between residence and citizenship is close enough
            that discrimination on the basis of the one criterion effectively amounts to
            discrimination based on the other. Cf. Travis v. Yale &amp;amp; Towne Mfg. Co., 252 U.
            S. 60, 79 (1920); Currie &amp;amp; Schreter, Unconstitutional Discrimination in the
            Conflict of Laws: Privileges and Immunities, 69 Yale L. J. 1323, 1344 (1960). These
            decisions are not, therefore, license for the Court to set aside the language of the
            Privileges and Immunities Clause as an inconvenient obstacle to a preferred result.
            Whenever this Court has departed from the literal language of the Clause in the past, it
            has remained faithful to the underlying purposes of the Clause. For the reasons already
            set forth, I believe that the Court's decision today does not satisfy that
            requirement.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>Needless to say, my view of the constitutional question in this case does not depend on
            my personal opinion about the desirability of the course on which Camden has embarked. I
            do not find "beggar thy neighbor" economic policies any more <span
               class="star-pagination">*235</span> attractive when practiced by municipalities than
            when practiced by States or nations. The unedifying sight of localities fighting for
            parochial gain at one another's expense gives new urgency to Benjamin Franklin's reputed
            warning that "we must . . . all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang
            separately." R. Clark, Benjamin Franklin 286 (1983). At the risk of restating the
            obvious, however, the issue before us is not the desirability of the ordinance but its
            constitutionality &#x97; more particularly, its constitutionality under the Privileges
            and Immunities Clause.<span class="sup">[16]</span> Because I believe that the Clause
            does not apply to discrimination based on municipal residence, I dissent.</p>

         <p>[1] "The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of
            Citizens in the several States."</p>
         <p>[2] The New Jersey Law Against Discrimination establishes a comprehensive
            affirmative-action program in the awarding of public works contracts. N. J. Stat. Ann.
            ยงยง 10:5-31 to 10:5-38 (West 1976). Any contractor, subcontractor, or firm seeking such
            contracts must guarantee compliance with an affirmative-action program approved by the
            State Treasurer. The Treasurer is empowered to promulgate specific affirmative-action
            requirements based on "the percentage of population of minority groups in the State or
            areas thereof." ยง 10:5-36(a). Alternatively, the law permits municipal and state
            agencies to adopt and administer their own affirmative-action plans. ยง 10:5-36(c). Such
            plans must be submitted to the State Treasurer to ensure that each plan conforms to the
            statutory and administrative requirements, and "establishes an employment goal which is
            not lower than the applicable goal established by" the Treasurer. N. J. Admin. Code
            17:27-6.5 (1982).</p>
         <p>[3] The specific scope of the ordinance was stated as follows: </p>
         <p>"Wherever the City of Camden spends funds derived from any public source for
            construction contracts or where the City of Camden confers a direct financial benefit
            upon a party, but excluding the grant of a property tax abatement, the fair market value
            of which exceeds $50,000.00, the provisions of this ordinance shall apply . . . . The
            provisions of this ordinance shall also apply to the development and construction of all
            residential housing of four (4) units or less." Ordinance MC 1650 ยง II, App. to Juris.
            Statement A38-A39.</p>
         <p>Appellant argued initially that the final sentence of this section extended the reach of
            the city's ordinance to purely private construction in which municipal funds were not
            involved. Appellees claimed that the ordinance was never so interpreted and has only
            been applied to projects funded in whole or in part by city funds or funds administered
            by the city. In light of subsequent amendments, see infra, at 213-214, the scope of the
            ordinance is no longer in issue.</p>
         <p>[4] The Council has at least some members who reside outside New Jersey.</p>
         <p>[5] The Council also challenged approval of the minority hiring goals as ultra vires the
            State Treasurer's authority and as a violation of equal protection. The New Jersey court
            rejected both arguments, finding approval of the goal within the clear scope of the
            State Treasurer's delegated authority and the goal itself constitutional under Fullilove
            v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448 (1980). 88 N. J., 317, 326-328, 330-337, 443 A. 2d 148,
            152-153, 154-158 (1982). The Council has not appealed from that ruling.</p>
         <p>[6] See n. 3, supra.</p>
         <p>[7] In White v. Massachusetts Council of Construction Employers, Inc., 460 U. S. 204,
            214-215, n. 12 (1983), we specifically declined to pass on the merits of a privileges
            and immunities challenge to the Mayor's executive order because the court below did not
            reach the issue.</p>
         <p>[8] As noted by the Supreme Court of New Jersey, this case was brought as a challenge to
            the State's administrative approval of the Camden ordinance, and not as a direct
            challenge to Camden's adoption of it. 88 N. J., at 324, 443 A. 2d, at 151.</p>
         <p>[9] The dissent suggests that New Jersey citizens not residing in Camden will adequately
            protect the interests of out-of-state residents and that the scope of the Privileges and
            Immunities Clause should be measured in light of this political reality. See, post, at
            231-232; post, at 227 ("the Framers had every reason to believe that intrastate
            discrimination based on municipal residence could and would be dealt with by the States
            themselves in those instances where it persisted"). What the dissent fails to appreciate
            is that the Camden ordinance at issue in this case was adopted pursuant to a
            comprehensive, statewide program applicable in all New Jersey cities. See n. 2, supra.
            The Camden resident-preference ordinance has already received state sanction and
            approval, see supra, at 212, and every New Jersey city is free to adopt a similar
            protectionist measure. Some have already done so. See Reply Brief for Appellant 41-42,
            n. 30, and App. A. Thus, it is hard to see how New Jersey residents living outside
            Camden will protect the interests of out-of-state citizens. </p>
         <p>More fundamentally, the dissent's proposed blanket exemption for all classifications
            that are less than statewide would provide States with a simple means for evading the
            strictures of the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Suppose, for example, that
            California wanted to guarantee that all employees of contractors and subcontractors
            working on construction projects funded in whole or in part by state funds are state
            residents. Under the dissent's analysis, the California Legislature need merely divide
            the State in half, providing one resident-hiring preference for northern Californians on
            all such projects taking place in northern California, and one for southern Californians
            on all projects taking place in southern California. State residents generally would
            benefit from the law at the expense of out-of-state residents; yet, the law would be
            immune from scrutiny under the Clause simply because it was not phrased in terms of
            state citizenship or residency. Such a formalistic construction would effectively write
            the Clause out of the Constitution.</p>
         <p>[10] Under the dissent's formalistic approach, see n. 9, supra, the "Alaska Hire"
            statute in Hicklin would have been exempt from any challenge under the Privileges and
            Immunities Clause if the Alaska Legislature had simply excluded from the hiring
            preference the residents of one remote county. Yet the discriminatory effect on
            out-of-state residents, with which, after all, the Clause is concerned, would have been
            the same.</p>
         <p>[1] "The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of
            Citizens in the several States." U. S. Const., Art. IV, ยง 2, cl. 1.</p>
         <p>[2] As the Court points out, it has come to treat the terms "citizen" and "resident"
            interchangeably for purposes of Privileges and Immunities Clause analysis. Ante, at 216.
            For the sake of simplicity I shall do the same, except where the context requires a
            distinction to be drawn.</p>
         <p>[3] I agree with the Court that the Camden ordinance is not insulted from scrutiny under
            the Privileges and Immunities Clause merely because it is a municipal ordinance rather
            than a state statute. Ante, at 214-215. See Woodruff v. Parham, <span class="citation">

         <p>[9] The idea that the Framers intended the Privileges and Immunities Clause to reach
            discrimination based on municipal residence appears even more implausible if one assumes
            that the Framers literally meant to confine the Clause's protections to "Privileges and
            Immunities of Citizens." If the purpose of the Clause were simply to relieve citizens of
            other States "from the disabilities of alienage" and guarantee them "the advantages
            resulting from citizenship," Paul v. Virginia, <span class="citation">

            and Immunities of Citizens in the Several States, pt. 2, 1 Mich. L. Rev. 364, 383

         <p>[11] JUSTICE O'CONNOR, who concurred in the judgment in Zobel, wrote separately to
            express the contrary view that the Privileges and Immunities Clause applied to the
            Alaska statute even though the statute arguably "discriminates among classes of
            residents, rather than between residents and nonresidents." 457 U. S., at 75. The
            Court's apparent reliance on JUSTICE O'CONNOR's concurrence, see ante, at 217-218, and
            its failure to note the position of the Court in Zobel are one measure of the
            inconsistency between today's decision and Zobel. Even JUSTICE O'CONNOR's reasoning,
            however, does not support the result the Court reaches today. For JUSTICE O'CONNOR, the
            critical effect of the Alaska statute was that "[e]ach group of citizens who migrated to
            Alaska in the past, or chooses to move there in the future, lives in the State on less
            favorable terms than those who arrived earlier"; a nonresident who moved to Alaska
            "labors under a continuous disability" because of his prior residence in another State.
            457 U. S., at 75. Here, in contrast, the Camden ordinance imposes no "continuous
            disability" on anyone who takes up residence in the city.</p>
         <p>[12] The Court suggests that reliance on the state political process is misplaced
            because the Camden ordinance itself "was adopted pursuant to a comprehensive statewide
            program applicable in all New Jersey cities" and has received "state sanction and
            approval." Ante, at 217, n. 9. The Court misrepresents the nature of both the statewide
            program and the "sanction and approval" given the Camden ordinance. The ordinance was
            enacted pursuant to a state statute designed solely to further equal opportunity and
            affirmative action in New Jersey public works contracting; the New Jersey Supreme Court
            itself accepted appellees' argument that the state statute "does not contemplate any
            residency requirement." 88 N. J. 317, 328, 443 A. 2d 148, 153 (1982). In turn, the
            ordinance was approved by a state agency whose sole mandate was to ensure that the
            ordinance was not inconsistent with the minimum affirmative-action requirements of the
            state statute. Id., at 329, 443 A. 2d, at 154. The municipal residency requirement thus
            has neither been embraced by the state legislature nor approved by any state agency with
            the authority to reject the ordinance on the basis of the residency requirement alone.
            Under these circumstances, the Court's observation reduces to the pedestrian point that
            the Camden ordinance has been adopted by the city and has yet to be displaced by the
            state legislature. That fact says nothing at all about the likelihood that the ordinance
            will be repealed in the future, of course, particularly should it develop on remand that
            interested parties like appellant ultimately must seek political rather than judicial
            vindication.</p>
         <p>[13] See Eisinger, Municipal Residency Requirements and the Local Economy, 64 Soc. Sci.
            Q. 85, 87 (1983); Note, The Constitutionality of Residency Requirements for Municipal
            Employees, 24 Emory L. J. 446, 448, n. 7 (1975); Note, Municipal Employee Residency
            Requirements and Equal Protection, 84 Yale L. J. 1684, n. 3 (1975).</p>
         <p>[14] Rather than respond directly to these considerations, the Court finds it easier to
            take issue with what it characterizes as "the dissent's proposed blanket exemption" from
            the Privileges and Immunities Clause "for all classifications that are less than
            statewide." Ante, at 217, n. 9. The Court's refusal to accept such an exemption is
            understandable; what is curious is why the Court attributes the exemption to this
            dissent. As I indicate below, I am no less prepared than the Court has been in the past
            to apply the Privileges and Immunities Clause when the classification at issue is
            practically equivalent to those explicitly identified by the Clause. If the Alaska
            Legislature were to try to rehabilitate the "Alaska Hire" statute invalidated in Hicklin
            v. Orbeck, 437 U. S. 518 (1978), by excluding "the residents of one remote county" from
            the hiring preference, ante, at 220, n. 10, for example, the classification would come
            within the ambit of the Clause because it would bear the same sort of practical
            relationship to a classification based on state citizenship as do classifications based
            on state residence. The Court fails to explain why a classification that benefits all
            state residents other than the residents of a single locality stands in the same
            position, in terms of the practical considerations underlying the Clause, as a
            classification that benefits only the residents of one locality. </p>
         <p>The Court raises the alternative prospect that a State might evade the Privileges and
            Immunities Clause by dividing itself in half and granting the residents in each half of
            the State employment preferences over residents in the other half of the State. Ante, at
            217-218, n. 9. The Clause exists to protect against those classifications that a State's
            political process cannot be relied on to prevent, however, not those that it can, and
            there is no reason to believe that state residents will be willing to forgo access to
            employment in one half of a State merely to obtain privileged access to jobs in the
            other half. The fact that no State has attempted anything resembling the Court's
            proposed maneuver in the two centuries since the adoption of the Clause, despite the
            fact that none of this Court's precedents has foreclosed the option, strongly suggests
            that state political processes can be trusted to prevent this kind of Balkanization. The
            Court cannot justify deforming the Constitution's response to real problems by invoking
            imaginary and unrealistic ones.</p>
         <p>[15] "Section 3 [of the Organic Act of Alaska] provides `The Constitution of the United
            States . . . shall have the same force and effect within the said Territory as elsewhere
            in the United States.' 37 Stat. 512, 48 U. S. C. ยง 23. And ยง 9 extends the legislative
            power of the Territory to `all rightful subjects of legislation not inconsistent with
            the Constitution and laws of the United States, . . . .' 37 Stat. 512, 514, 48 U. S. C.
            ยง 77. In the light of these sections, we cannot presume that Congress authorized the
            Territorial Legislature to treat citizens of States the way States cannot treat citizens
            of sister States. . . . [T]he Territorial Legislature, particularly in the regulation of
            fisheries, was granted no greater power over citizens of other States than a State
            legislature has." 342 U. S., at 420.</p>
         <p>[16] I argued without success last Term that, absent congressional authorization,
            ordinances like Camden's violate the dormant Commerce Clause. White v. Massachusetts
            Council of Construction Employers, Inc., 460 U. S. 204, 215 (1983) (opinion concurring
            in part and dissenting in part). Although the Privileges and Immunities Clause and the
            Commerce Clause embody closely related principles of interstate relations, I agree with
            the Court that in certain circumstances the two Clauses "set different standards for
            state conduct." Ante, at 220. This is one such circumstance; the Commerce Clause entails
            a substantive policy of unimpeded interstate commerce that is impermissibly undermined
            by local protectionism even when intrastate commerce is penalized as well. See Dean Milk
            Co. v. Madison, 340 U. S. 349, 354, and n. 4 (1951).</p>
