            <span class="star-pagination">*653</span> MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of
            the Court.</p>
         <p>Respondent John Jordan filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the
            Northern District of Illinois, individually and as a representative of a class, seeking
            declaratory and injunctive relief against two former directors of the Illinois
            Department of Public Aid, the director of the Cook County Department of Public Aid, and
            the comptroller of Cook County. Respondent alleged that these state officials were
            administering the federal-state programs of Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled (AABD)
            in a manner inconsistent with various federal regulations and with the Fourteenth
            Amendment to the Constitution.<span class="sup">[1]</span>
         </p>
         <p>AABD is one of the categorical aid programs administered by the Illinois Department of
            Public Aid pursuant to the Illinois Public Aid Code, Ill. Rev. Stat., c. 23, §§ 3-1
            through 3-12 (1973). Under the Social Security Act, the program is funded by the State
            and the Federal Governments. 42 U. S. C. §§ 1381-1385.<span class="sup">[2]</span> The
            Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), <span class="star-pagination"
               >*654</span> which administers these payments for the Federal Government, issued
            regulations prescribing maximum permissible time standards within which States
            participating in the program had to process AABD applications. Those regulations,
            originally issued in 1968, required, at the time of the institution of this suit, that
            eligibility determinations must be made by the States within 30 days of receipt of
            applications for aid to the aged and blind, and within 45 days of receipt of
            applications for aid to the disabled. For those persons found eligible, the assistance
            check was required to be received by them within the applicable time period. 45 CFR §
            206.10 (a) (3).<span class="sup">[3]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*655</span> During the period in which the federal
            regulations went into effect, Illinois public aid officials were administering the
            benefits pursuant to their own regulations as provided in the Categorical Assistance
            Manual of the Illinois Department of Public Aid.<span class="sup">[4]</span>
            Respondent's complaint charged that the Illinois defendants, operating under those
            regulations, were improperly authorizing grants to commence only with the month in which
            an application was approved and not including prior eligibility months for which an
            applicant was entitled to aid under federal law. The complaint also alleged that the
            Illinois defendants were not processing the applications within the applicable time
            requirements of the federal regulations; specifically, respondent alleged that his own
            application <span class="star-pagination">*656</span> for disability benefits was not
            acted on by the Illinois Department of Public Aid for almost four months. Such actions
            of the Illinois officials were alleged to violate federal law and deny the equal
            protection of the laws. Respondent's prayer requested declaratory and injective relief,
            and specifically requested "a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants to award to
            the entire class of plaintiffs all AABD benefits wrongfully withheld."</p>
         <p>In its judgment of March 15, 1972, the District Court declared § 4004 of the Illinois
            Manual to be invalid insofar as it was inconsistent with the federal regulations found
            in 45 CFR § 206.10 (a) (3), and granted a permanent injunction requiring compliance with
            the federal time limits for processing and paying AABD applicants. The District Court,
            in paragraph 5 of its judgment, also ordered the state officials to "release and remit
            AABD benefits wrongfully withheld to all applicants for AABD in the State of Illinois
            who applied between July 1, 1968 [the date of the federal regulations] and April 16,
            197[1] [the date of the preliminary injunction issued by the District Court] and were
            determined eligible . . . ."<span class="sup">[5]</span>

            <span class="star-pagination">*657</span> On appeal to the United States Court of
            Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the Illinois officials contended, inter alia, that the
            Eleventh Amendment barred the award of <span class="star-pagination">*658</span>
            retroactive benefits, that the judgment of inconsistency between the federal regulations
            and the provisions of the Illinois Categorical Assistance Manual could be given
            prospective effect only, and that the federal regulations in question were inconsistent
            with the Social Security Act itself. The Court of Appeals rejected these contentions and
            affirmed the judgment of the District Court. Jordan v. Weaver, 472 F. 2d 985
               (1973).<span class="sup">[6]</span> Because of an apparent conflict on the Eleventh
            Amendment issue with the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in
            Rothstein v. Wyman, 467 F. 2d 226 (1972), cert. denied, 411 U. S. 921 (1973), we granted
            the petition for certiorari filed by petitioner Joel Edelman, who is the present
            Director of the Illinois Department of Public Aid, and successor to the former directors
            sued below. 412 U. S. 937 (1973). The petition for certiorari raised the same
            contentions urged by the petitioner in the Court of Appeals.<span class="sup">[7]</span>
            Because we believe the Court of Appeals <span class="star-pagination">*659</span> erred
            in its disposition of the Eleventh Amendment claim, we reverse that portion of the Court
            of Appeals decision which affirmed the District Court's order that retroactive benefits
            be paid by the Illinois state officials.<span class="sup">[8]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*660</span> The historical basis of the Eleventh Amendment
            has been oft stated, and it represents one of the more dramatic examples of this Court's
            effort to derive meaning from the document given to the Nation by the Framers nearly 200
            years ago. A leading historian of the Court tells us:</p> "The right of the Federal
         Judiciary to summon a State as defendant and to adjudicate its rights and liabilities had
         been the subject of deep apprehension and of active debate at the time of the adoption of
         the Constitution; but the existence of any such right had been disclaimed by many of the
         most eminent advocates of the new Federal Government, and it was largely owing to their
         successful dissipation of the fear of the existence of such Federal power that the
         Constitution was finally adopted." 1 C. Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History
         91 (rev. ed. 1937). <p>Despite such disclaimers,<span class="sup">[9]</span> the very first
            suit entered <span class="star-pagination">*661</span> in this Court at its February
            Term in 1791 was brought against the State of Maryland by a firm of Dutch bankers as
            creditors. Vanstophorst v. Maryland, see 2 Dall. <span class="star-pagination"
               >*662</span> 401 and Warren, supra, at 91 n. 1. The subsequent year brought the
            institution of additional suits against other States, and caused considerable alarm and
            consternation in the country.</p>
         <p>The issue was squarely presented to the Court in a suit brought at the August 1792 Term
            by two citizens of South Carolina, executors of a British creditor, against the State of
            Georgia. After a year's postponement for preparation on the part of the State of
            Georgia, the Court, after argument, rendered in February 1793, its short-lived decision
            in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419. The decision in that case, that a State was liable
            to suit by a citizen of another State or of a foreign country, literally shocked the
            Nation. Sentiment for passage of a constitutional amendment to override the decision
            rapidly gained momentum, and five years after Chisholm the Eleventh Amendment was
            officially announced by President John Adams. Unchanged since then, the Amendment
            provides:</p> "The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend
         to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by
         Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State." <p>While the
            Amendment by its terms does not bar suits against a State by its own citizens, this
            Court has consistently <span class="star-pagination">*663</span> held that an
            unconsenting State is immune from suits brought in federal courts by her own citizens as
            well as by citizens of another State. Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890); Duhne v.
            New Jersey, 251 U. S. 311 (1920); Great Northern Life Insurance Co. v. Read, 322 U. S.
            47 (1944); Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184 (1964); Employees v. Department of
            Public Health and Welfare, 411 U. S. 279 (1973). It is also well established that even
            though a State is not named a party to the action, the suit may nonetheless be barred by
            the Eleventh Amendment. In Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, 323 U. S. 459
            (1945), the Court said:</p> "[W]hen the action is in essence one for the recovery of
         money from the state, the state is the real, substantial party in interest and is entitled
         to invoke its sovereign immunity from suit even though individual officials are nominal
         defendants." Id., at 464. <p>Thus the rule has evolved that a suit by private parties
            seeking to impose a liability which must be paid from public funds in the state treasury
            is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Great Northern Life Insurance Co. v. Read, supra;
            Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Comm'n, 327 U. S. 573 (1946).</p>
         <p>The Court of Appeals in this case, while recognizing that the Hans line of cases
            permitted the State to raise the Eleventh Amendment as a defense to suit by its own
            citizens, nevertheless concluded that the Amendment did not bar the award of retroactive
            payments of the statutory benefits found to have been wrongfully withheld. The Court of
            Appeals held that the above-cited cases, when read in light of this Court's landmark
            decision in Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), do not preclude <span
               class="star-pagination">*664</span> the grant of such a monetary award in the nature
            of equitable restitution.</p>
         <p>Petitioner concedes that Ex parte Young, supra, is no bar to that part of the District
            Court's judgment that prospectively enjoined petitioner's predecessors from failing to
            process applications within the time limits established by the federal regulations.
            Petitioner argues, however, that Ex parte Young does not extend so far as to permit a
            suit which seeks the award of an accrued monetary liability which must be met from the
            general revenues of a State, absent consent or waiver by the State of its Eleventh
            Amendment immunity, and that therefore the award of retroactive benefits by the District
            Court was improper.</p>
         <p>Ex parte Young was a watershed case in which this Court held that the Eleventh Amendment
            did not bar an action in the federal courts seeking to enjoin the Attorney General of
            Minnesota from enforcing a statute claimed to violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the
            United States Constitution. This holding has permitted the Civil War Amendments to the
            Constitution to serve as a sword, rather than merely as a shield, for those whom they
            were designed to protect. But the relief awarded in Ex parte Young was prospective only;
            the Attorney General of Minnesota was enjoined to conform his future conduct of that
            office to the requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment. Such relief is analogous to that
            awarded by the District Court in the prospective portion of its order under review in
            this case.</p>
         <p>But the retroactive portion of the District Court's order here, which requires the
            payment of a very substantial amount of money which that court held should have been
            paid, but was not, stands on quite a different footing. These funds will obviously not
            be paid out of the pocket of petitioner Edelman. Addressing himself to a similar
            situation in Rothstein v. Wyman, 467 F. 2d 226 <span class="star-pagination">*665</span>
            (CA2 1972), cert. denied, 411 U. S. 921 (1973), Judge McGowan<span class="sup"
               >[10]</span> observed for the court:</p> "It is not pretended that these payments are
         to come from the personal resources of these appellants. Appellees expressly contemplate
         that they will, rather, involve substantial expenditures from the public funds of the
         state. . . . "It is one thing to tell the Commissioner of Social Services that he must
         comply with the federal standards for the future if the state is to have the benefit of
         federal funds in the programs he administers. It is quite another thing to order the
         Commissioner to use state funds to make reparation for the past. The latter would appear to
         us to fall afoul of the Eleventh Amendment if that basic constitutional provision is to be
         conceived of as having any present force." 467 F. 2d, at 236-237 (footnotes omitted). <p>We
            agree with Judge McGowan's observations. The funds to satisfy the award in this case
            must inevitably come from the general revenues of the State of Illinois, and thus the
            award resembles far more closely the monetary award against the State itself, Ford Motor
            Co. v. Department of Treasury, supra, than it does the prospective injunctive relief
            awarded in Ex parte Young.</p>
         <p>The Court of Appeals, in upholding the award in this case, held that it was permissible
            because it was in the form of "equitable restitution" instead of damages, and therefore
            capable of being tailored in such a way as to minimize disruptions of the state program
            of categorical assistance. But we must judge the award actually made in this case, and
            not one which might have been differently tailored in a different case, and we must
            judge <span class="star-pagination">*666</span> it in the context of the important
            constitutional principle embodied in the Eleventh Amendment.<span class="sup"
               >[11]</span>
         </p>
         <p>We do not read Ex parte Young or subsequent holdings of this Court to indicate that any
            form of relief may be awarded against a state officer, no matter how closely it may in
            practice resemble a money judgment payable out of the state treasury, so long as the
            relief may be labeled "equitable" in nature. The Court's opinion in Ex parte Young hewed
            to no such line. Its citation of Hagood v. Southern, 117 U. S. 52 (1886), and In re
            Ayers, 123 U. S. 443 (1887), which were both actions <span class="star-pagination"
               >*667</span> against state officers for specific performance of a contract to which
            the State was a party, demonstrate that equitable relief may be barred by the Eleventh
            Amendment.</p>
         <p>As in most areas of the law, the difference between the type of relief barred by the
            Eleventh Amendment and that permitted under Ex parte Young will not in many instances be
            that between day and night. The injunction issued in Ex parte Young was not totally
            without effect on the State's revenues, since the state law which the Attorney General
            was enjoined from enforcing provided substantial monetary penalties against railroads
            which did not conform to its provisions. Later cases from this Court have authorized
            equitable relief which has probably had greater impact on state treasuries than did that
            awarded in Ex parte Young. In Graham v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 365 (1971), Arizona and
            Pennsylvania welfare officials were prohibited from denying welfare benefits to
            otherwise qualified recipients who were aliens. In Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U. S. 254
            (1970), New York City welfare officials were enjoined from following New York State
            procedures which authorized the termination of benefits paid to welfare recipients
            without prior hearing.<span class="sup">[12]</span> But the fiscal consequences to state
               <span class="star-pagination">*668</span> treasuries in these cases were the
            necessary result of compliance with decrees which by their terms were prospective in
            nature. State officials, in order to shape their official conduct to the mandate of the
            Court's decrees, would more likely have to spend money from the state treasury than if
            they had been left free to pursue their previous course of conduct. Such an ancillary
            effect on the state treasury is a permissible and often an inevitable consequence of the
            principle announced in Ex parte Young, supra.</p>
         <p>But that portion of the District Court's decree which petitioner challenges on Eleventh
            Amendment grounds goes much further than any of the cases cited. It requires payment of
            state funds, not as a necessary consequence of compliance in the future with a
            substantive federal-question determination, but as a form of compensation to those whose
            applications were processed on the slower time schedule at a time when petitioner was
            under no court-imposed obligation to conform to a different standard. While the Court of
            Appeals described this retroactive award of monetary relief as a form of "equitable
            restitution," it is in practical effect indistinguishable in many aspects from an award
            of damages against the State. It will to a virtual certainty be paid from state funds,
            and not from the pockets of the individual state officials who were the defendants in
            the action. It is measured in terms of a monetary loss resulting from a past breach of a
            legal duty on the part of the defendant state officials.</p>
         <p>Were we to uphold this portion of the District Court's decree, we would be obligated to
            overrule the Court's holding in Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, supra. There a
            taxpayer, who had, under protest, paid taxes to the State of Indiana, sought a refund of
            those taxes from the Indiana state officials who were charged with their collection. The
            taxpayer claimed that the tax <span class="star-pagination">*669</span> had been imposed
            in violation of the United States Constitution. The term "equitable restitution" would
            seem even more applicable to the relief sought in that case, since the taxpayer had at
            one time had the money, and paid it over to the State pursuant to an allegedly
            unconstitutional tax exaction. Yet this Court had no hesitation in holding that the
            taxpayer's action was a suit against the State, and barred by the Eleventh Amendment. We
            reach a similar conclusion with respect to the retroactive portion of the relief awarded
            by the District Court in this case.</p>
         <p>The Court of Appeals expressed the view that its conclusion on the Eleventh Amendment
            issue was supported by this Court's holding in Department of Employment v. United
            States, 385 U. S. 355 (1966). There the United States was held entitled to sue the
            Colorado Department of Employment in the United States District Court for refund of
            unemployment compensation taxes paid under protest by the American National Red Cross,
            an instrumentality of the United States. The discussion of the State's Eleventh
            Amendment claim is confined to the following sentence in the opinion:</p> "With respect
         to appellants' contention that the State of Colorado has not consented to suit in a federal
         forum even where the plaintiff is the United States, see Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S.
         313 (1934), and Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908)." Id., at 358. <p>Monaco v.
            Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313 (1934), reaffirmed the principle that the Eleventh Amendment
            was no bar to a suit by the United States against a State. Id., at 329. In view of Mr.
            Chief Justice Hughes' vigorous reaffirmation in Monaco of the principles of the Eleventh
            Amendment and sovereign immunity, we think it unlikely that the Court in Department of
            Employment v. United States, in citing Ex parte Young as well as Monaco, <span
               class="star-pagination">*670</span> intended to foreshadow a departure from the rule
            to which we adhere today.</p>
         <p>Three fairly recent District Court judgments requiring state directors of public aid to
            make the type of retroactive payment involved here have been summarily affirmed by this
            Court notwithstanding Eleventh Amendment contentions made by state officers who were
            appealing from the District Court judgment.<span class="sup">[13]</span>Shapiro v.
            Thompson, 394 U. S. 618 (1969), is the only instance in which the Eleventh Amendment
            objection to such retroactive relief was actually presented to this Court in a case
            which was orally argued. The three-judge District Court in that case had ordered the
            retroactive payment of welfare benefits found by that court to have been unlawfully
            withheld because of residence requirements held violative of equal protection. <span
               class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">270</span>
               <span class="reporter">F. Supp.</span>
               <span class="page">331</span>
            </span>, 338 n. 5 (Conn. 1967). This Court, while affirming the judgment, did not in its
            opinion refer to or substantively treat the Eleventh Amendment argument. Nor, of course,
            did the summary dispositions of the three District Court cases contain any substantive
            discussion of this or any other issues raised by the parties.</p>
         <p>This case, therefore, is the first opportunity the Court has taken to fully explore and
            treat the Eleventh Amendment <span class="star-pagination">*671</span> aspects of such
            relief in a written opinion. Shapiro v. Thompson and these three summary affirmances
            obviously are of precedential value in support of the contention that the Eleventh
            Amendment does not bar the relief awarded by the District Court in this case. Equally
            obviously, they are not of the same precedential value as would be an opinion of this
            Court treating the question on the merits. Since we deal with a constitutional question,
            we are less constrained by the principle of stare decisis than we are in other areas of
            the law.<span class="sup">[14]</span> Having now had an opportunity to more fully
            consider the Eleventh Amendment issue after briefing and argument, we disapprove the
            Eleventh Amendment holdings of those cases to the extent that they are inconsistent with
            our holding today.</p>
         <p>The Court of Appeals held in the alternative that even if the Eleventh Amendment be
            deemed a bar to the retroactive relief awarded respondent in this case, the State of
            Illinois had waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity and consented to the bringing of
            such a suit by participating in the federal AABD program. The Court of Appeals relied
            upon our holdings in Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184 (1964), and Petty v.
            Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm'n, 359 U. S. 275 (1959), <span class="star-pagination"
               >*672</span> and on the dissenting opinion of Judge Bright in Employees v. Department
            of Public Health and Welfare, 452 F. 2d 820, 827 (CA8 1971). While the holding in the
            latter case was ultimately affirmed by this Court in 411 U. S. 279 (1973), we do not
            think that the answer to the waiver question turns on the distinction between Parden,
            supra, and Employees, supra. Both Parden and Employees involved a congressional
            enactment which by its terms authorized suit by designated plaintiffs against a general
            class of defendants which literally included States or state instrumentalities.
            Similarly, Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm'n, supra, involved congressional
            approval, pursuant to the Compact Clause, of a compact between Tennessee and Missouri,
            which provided that each compacting State would have the power "to contract, to sue, and
            be sued in its own name." The question of waiver or consent under the Eleventh Amendment
            was found in those cases to turn on whether Congress had intended to abrogate the
            immunity in question, and whether the State by its participation in the program
            authorized by Congress had in effect consented to the abrogation of that immunity.</p>
         <p>But in this case the threshold fact of congressional authorization to sue a class of
            defendants which literally includes States is wholly absent. Thus respondent is not only
            precluded from relying on this Court's holding in Employees, but on this Court's
            holdings in Parden and Petty as well.<span class="sup">[15]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*673</span> The Court of Appeals held that as a matter of
            federal law Illinois had "constructively consented" to this suit by participating in the
            federal AABD program and agreeing to administer federal and state funds in compliance
            with federal law. Constructive consent is not a doctrine commonly associated with the
            surrender of constitutional rights, and we see no place for it here. In deciding whether
            a State has waived its constitutional protection under the Eleventh Amendment, we will
            find waiver only where stated "by the most express language or by such overwhelming
            implications from the text as [will] leave no room for any other reasonable
            construction." Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co., 213 U. S. 151, 171 (1909). We see no
            reason to retreat from the Court's statement in Great Northern Life Insurance Co. v.
            Read, 322 U. S. at 54 (footnote omitted):</p> "[W]hen we are dealing with the sovereign
         exemption from judicial interference in the vital field of financial administration a clear
         declaration of the state's intention to submit its fiscal problems to other courts than
         those of its own creation must be found." <p>The mere fact that a State participates in a
            program through which the Federal Government provides assistance for the operation by
            the State of a system of public aid is not sufficient to establish consent on the part
            of the State to be sued in the federal courts. And while this Court has, in cases such
            as J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 <span class="star-pagination">*674</span> U. S. 426
            (1964), authorized suits by one private party against another in order to effectuate a
            statutory purpose, it has never done so in the context of the Eleventh Amendment and a
            state defendant. Since Employees, supra, where Congress had expressly authorized suits
            against a general class of defendants and the only thing left to implication was whether
            the described class of defendants included States, was decided adversely to the putative
            plaintiffs on the waiver question, surely this respondent must also fail on that issue.
            The only language in the Social Security Act which purported to provide a federal
            sanction against a State which did not comply with federal requirements for the
            distribution of federal monies was found in former 42 U. S. C. § 1384 (now replaced by
            substantially similar provisions in 42 U. S. C. § 804), which provided for termination
            of future allocations of federal funds when a participating State failed to conform with
            federal law.<span class="sup">[16]</span> This provision by its terms did not authorize
            suit against anyone, and standing alone, fell far short of a waiver by a participating
            State of its Eleventh Amendment immunity.</p>
         <p>Our Brother MARSHALL argues in dissent, and the Court of Appeals held, that although the
            Social Security Act itself does not create a private cause of action, the cause of
            action created by 42 U. S. C. § 1983, coupled with the enactment of the AABD program,
            and the issuance by HEW of regulations which require the States to make corrective
            payments after successful "fair hearings" <span class="star-pagination">*675</span> and
            provide for federal matching funds to satisfy federal court orders of retroactive
            payments, indicate that Congress intended a cause of action for public aid recipients
            such as respondent.<span class="sup">[17]</span> It is, of course, true that Rosado v.
            Wyman, 397 U. S. 397 (1970), held that suits in federal court under § 1983 are proper to
            secure compliance with the provisions of the Social Security Act on the part of
            participating States.<span class="sup">[18]</span> But it has not heretofore <span
               class="star-pagination">*676</span> been suggested that § 1983 was intended to create
            a waiver of a State's Eleventh Amendment immunity merely because an action could be
            brought under that <span class="star-pagination">*677</span> section against state
            officers, rather than against the State itself. Though a § 1983 action may be instituted
            by public aid recipients such as respondent, a federal court's remedial power,
            consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, is necessarily limited to prospective injunctive
            relief, Ex parte Young, supra, and may not include a retroactive award which requires
            the payment of funds from the state treasury, Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury,
            supra.</p>
         <p>Respondent urges that since the various Illinois officials sued in the District Court
            failed to raise the Eleventh Amendment as a defense to the relief sought by respondent,
            petitioner is therefore barred<span class="sup">[19]</span> from raising the Eleventh
            Amendment defense in the Court of Appeals or in this Court. The Court of Appeals
            apparently felt the defense was properly presented, and dealt with it on the merits. We
            approve of this resolution, since it has been well settled since the decision <span
               class="star-pagination">*678</span> in Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury,
            supra, that the Eleventh Amendment defense sufficiently partakes of the nature of a
            jurisdictional bar so that it need not be raised in the trial court:</p> "[The Attorney
         General of Indiana] appeared in the federal District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals
         and defended the suit on the merits. The objection to petitioner's suit as a violation of
         the Eleventh Amendment was first made and argued by Indiana in this Court. This was in
         time, however. The Eleventh Amendment declares a policy and sets forth an explicit
         limitation on federal judicial power of such compelling force that this Court will consider
         the issue arising under this Amendment in this case even though urged for the first time in
         this Court." 323 U. S., at 466-467. <p>For the foregoing reasons we decide that the Court
            of Appeals was wrong in holding that the Eleventh Amendment did not constitute a bar to
            that portion of the District Court decree which ordered retroactive payment of benefits
            found to have been wrongfully withheld. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
            therefore reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
            opinion.</p>
         <p>So ordered.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="dissent" judge="douglas"><p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.</p>
         <p>Congress provided in 42 U. S. C. § 1983 that:</p> "Every person who, under color of any
         statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or
         causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the
         jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by
         the Constitution <span class="star-pagination">*679</span> and laws, shall be liable to the
         party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress."
            <p>In this class action respondent sought to enforce against state aid officials of
            Illinois provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U. S. C. §§ 1381-1385, known as the
            Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled (AABD) program.<span class="sup">[1]</span> The
            complaint alleges violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
            and also violations of the Social Security Act. Hence § 1983 is satisfied in haec verba,
            for a deprivation of "rights" which are "secured by the Constitution and laws" is
            alleged. The Court of Appeals, though ruling that the alleged constitutional violations
            had not occurred, sustained federal jurisdiction because federal "rights" were violated.
            The main issue tendered us is whether that ruling of the Court of Appeals is consistent
            with the Eleventh Amendment.<span class="sup">[2]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*680</span> Once the federal court had jurisdiction over
            the case, the fact that it ruled adversely to the claimant on the constitutional claim
            did not deprive it of its pendent jurisdiction over the statutory claim. United States
            v. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 371 U. S. 285, 287-288.</p>
         <p>In Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, a suit by stockholders of a railroad was brought in a
            federal court against state officials to enjoin the imposition of confiscatory rates on
            the railroad in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Eleventh Amendment was
            interposed as a defense. The Court rejected the defense, saying that state officials
            with authority to enforce state laws "who threaten and are about to commence
            proceedings, either of a civil or criminal nature, to enforce against parties affected
            an unconstitutional act, violating the Federal Constitution, may be enjoined by a
            Federal court of equity from such action." Id., at 156. The Court went on to say that a
            state official seeking to enforce in the name of a State an unconstitutional act "comes
            into conflict with the superior authority of that Constitution, and he is in that case
            stripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to
            the consequence of his individual conduct. The State has no power to impart to him any
            immunity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the United States." Id., at
            159-160.</p>
         <p>As the complaint in the instant case alleges violations by officials of Illinois of the
            Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, it seems that the case is governed
            by Ex parte Young so far as injective relief is concerned. The main thrust of the
            argument is that the instant case asks for relief which if granted would affect the
            treasury of the State.</p>
         <p>Most welfare decisions by federal courts have a financial <span class="star-pagination"
               >*681</span> impact on the States. Under the existing federal-state cooperative
            system, a state desiring to participate, submits a "state plan" to HEW for approval;
            once HEW approves the plan the State is locked into the cooperative scheme until it
               withdraws,<span class="sup">[3]</span> all as described in King v. Smith, 392 U. S.
            309, 316 et seq. The welfare cases coming here have involved ultimately the financial
            responsibility of the State to beneficiaries claiming they were deprived of federal
            rights. King v. Smith required payment to children even though their mother was
            co-habitating with a man who could not pass muster as a <span class="star-pagination"
               >*682</span> "parent." Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U. S. 397, held that under this
            state-federal cooperative program a State could not reduce its standard of need in
            conflict with the federal standard. It is true that Rosado did not involve retroactive
            payments as are involved here. But the distinction is not relevant or material because
            the result in every welfare case coming here is to increase or reduce the financial
            responsibility of the participating State. In no case when the responsibility of the
            State is increased to meet the lawful demand of the beneficiary, is there any levy on
            state funds. Whether the decree is prospective only or requires payments for the weeks
            or months wrongfully skipped over by the state officials, the nature of the impact on
            the state treasury is precisely the same.</p>
         <p>We have granted relief in other welfare cases which included retroactive assistance
            benefits or payments. In State Dept. of Health and Rehabilitative Services v. Zarate,
            407 U. S. 918, the sole issue presented to us<span class="sup">[4]</span> was whether
            the Eleventh Amendment barred a judgment against state officers for retroactive welfare
            assistance benefits or payments. That had been ordered by the lower court and we
            summarily affirmed, only MR. JUSTICE WHITE voting to note probable jurisdiction. We also
            summarily affirmed the judgment in Sterrett v. Mothers' &amp;amp; Children's Rights
            Organization, 409 U. S. 809, where one of the two questions<span class="sup">[5]</span>
            was whether retroactive payments of benefits violated the Eleventh Amendment. In Wyman
            v. Bowens, 397 U. S. 49, we affirmed a judgment <span class="star-pagination"
               >*683</span> where payments were awarded in spite of the argument that the order was
            an incursion on the Eleventh Amendment.<span class="sup">[6]</span> In Shapiro v.
            Thompson, 394 U. S. 618, we affirmed a judgment which ordered payment of benefits
            wrongfully withheld;<span class="sup">[7]</span> and while we did not specifically refer
            to the point, the lower court had expressly rejected the Eleventh Amendment
               argument.<span class="sup">[8]</span>
         </p>
         <p>In Gaither v. Sterrett, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/innd/aCB3/gaither-v-sterrett/">

            </span>, 1099, whose judgment we affirmed,<span class="sup">[9]</span> 409 U. S. 1070,
            the court said:</p> "[T]his court would note that if defendants' position regarding the
         jurisdictional bar of the Eleventh Amendment is correct, a great number of federal district
         court judgments are void, and the Supreme Court has affirmed many of these void judgments."
            <p>The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is in line with that view; the opposed
            view of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Rothstein v. Wyman, 467 F. 2d
            226, is out of harmony with the established law.</p>
         <p>What is asked by the instant case is minor compared to the relief granted in Griffin v.
            School Board, 377 U. S. 218. In that case we authorized entry of an order putting an end
            to a segregated school system. We held, inter alia, that "the District Court may, if
            necessary to prevent further racial discrimination, require the Supervisors to <span
               class="star-pagination">*684</span> exercise the power that is theirs to levy taxes
            to raise funds adequate to reopen, operate, and maintain without racial discrimination a
            public school system in Prince Edward County like that operated in other counties in
            Virginia." Id., at 233. We so held against vigorous contentions of the state officials
            that the Eleventh Amendment protected the State; and in reply we cited Lincoln County v.
            Luning, 133 U. S. 529, and Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Comm'n, 327 U. S. 573,
            579, to support the proposition that "actions against a county can be maintained in
            United States courts in order to vindicate federally guaranteed rights." 377 U. S., at
            233.</p>
         <p>Griffin is sought to be distinguished on the ground that a "county" is not the "state"
            for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment. But constitutionally the county in Griffin was
            exercising state policy as are the counties here, because otherwise the claim of denial
            of equal protection would be of no avail.</p>
         <p>Counties are citizens of their State for purposes of diversity of citizenship. Bullard
            v. City of Cisco, 290 U. S. 179; Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693, 718-719. And
            they are not States for purposes of 28 U. S. C. § 1251 (a) which gives this Court
            original and exclusive jurisdiction of: "(1) All controversies between two or more
            states. . . ." Illinois v. City of Milwaukee, 406 U. S. 91, 98. But, being citizens of
            their State, suits against them by another State are in our original but not exclusive
            jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. § 1251 (b) (3). Ibid. Yet, as agencies of the State
            whether in carrying out educational policies or otherwise, they are the State, as
            Griffin held, for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. And Griffin, like the present
            case, dealt only with liability to citizens for state policy and state action.</p>
         <p>Yet petitioner asserts that money damages may not be awarded against state offenses, as
            such a judgment <span class="star-pagination">*685</span> will expend itself on the
            state treasury. But we are unable to say that Illinois on entering the federal-state
            welfare program waived its immunity to suit for injunctions but did not waive its
            immunity for compensatory awards which remedy its willful defaults of obligations
            undertaken when it joined the cooperative venture.<span class="sup">[10]</span>
         </p>
         <p>It is said however, that the Eleventh Amendment is concerned, not with immunity of
            States from suit, but with the jurisdiction of the federal courts to entertain the suit.
            The Eleventh Amendment does not speak of "jurisdiction"; it withholds the "judicial
            power" of federal courts "to any suit in law or equity . . . against one of the United
            States . . . ." If that "judicial power," or "jurisdiction" if one prefers that concept,
            may not be exercised even in "any suit in . . . equity" then Ex parte Young should be
            overruled. But there is none eager to take the step. Where a State has consented to join
            a federal-state cooperative project, it is realistic to conclude that the State has
            agreed to assume its obligations under that legislation. There is nothing in the
            Eleventh Amendment to suggest a difference between suits at law and suits in equity, for
            it treats the two without distinction. If common sense has any role to play in
            constitutional adjudication, once there is a waiver of immunity it must be true that it
            is complete so far as effective operation of the state-federal joint welfare program is
            concerned.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*686</span> We have not always been unanimous in
            concluding when a State has waived its immunity. In Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S.
            184, where Alabama was sued by some of its citizens for injuries suffered in the
            interstate operation of an Alabama railroad, the State defended on the grounds of the
            Eleventh Amendment. The Court held that Alabama was liable as a carrier under the
            Federal Employers' Liability Act, saying:</p> "Our conclusion is simply that Alabama,
         when it began operation of an interstate railroad approximately 20 years after enactment of
         the FELA, necessarily consented to such suit as was authorized by that Act," id., at 192.
            <p>The Court added:</p> "Our conclusion that this suit may be maintained is in accord
         with the common sense of this Nation's federalism. A State's immunity from suit by an
         individual without its consent has been fully recognized by the Eleventh Amendment and by
         subsequent decisions of this Court. But when a State leaves the sphere that is exclusively
         its own and enters into activities subject to congressional regulation, it subjects itself
         to that regulation as fully as if it were a private person or corporation." Id., at 196.
            <p>As the Court of Appeals in the instant case concluded, Illinois by entering into the
            joint federal-state welfare plan just as surely "[left] the sphere that is exclusively
            its own." Ibid.</p>
         <p>It is argued that participation in the program of federal financial assistance is not
            sufficient to establish consent on the part of the State to be sued in federal courts.
            But it is not merely participation which supports a finding of Eleventh Amendment
            waiver, but <span class="star-pagination">*687</span> participation in light of the
            existing state of the law as exhibited in such decisions as Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.
            S. 618, which affirmed judgments ordering retroactive payment of benefits. Today's
            holding that the Eleventh Amendment forbids court-ordered retroactive payments, as the
            Court recognizes, necessitates an express overruling of several of our recent decisions.
            But it was against the background of those decisions that Illinois continued its
            participation in the federal program, and it can hardly be claimed that such
            participation was in ignorance of the possibility of court-ordered retroactive payments.
            The decision to participate against that background of precedent can only be viewed as a
            waiver of immunity from such judgments.</p>
         <p>I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="dissent" judge="brennan">
         <p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, dissenting.</p>
         <p>This suit is brought by Illinois citizens against Illinois officials. In that
            circumstance, Illinois may not invoke the Eleventh Amendment, since that Amendment bars
            only federal court suits against States by citizens of other States. Rather, the
            question is whether Illinois may avail itself of the nonconstitutional but ancient
            doctrine of sovereign immunity as a bar to respondent's claim for retroactive AABD
            payments. In my view Illinois may not assert sovereign immunity for the reason I
            expressed in dissent in Employees v. Department of Public Health and Welfare, 411 U. S.
            279, 298 (1973): the States surrendered that immunity in Hamilton's words, "in the plan
            of the Convention," that formed the Union, at least insofar as the States granted
            Congress specifically enumerated powers. See id., at 319 n. 7; Parden v. Terminal R.
            Co., 377 U. S. 184 (1964). Congressional authority to enact the Social Security Act, of
            which AABD is a part, former 42 U. S. C. §§ 1381-1385 <span class="star-pagination"
               >*688</span> (now replaced by similar provisions in 42 U. S. C. § 801-804 (1970 ed.,
            Supp. II)), is to be found in Art. I, § 8, cl. 1, one of the enumerated powers granted
            Congress by the States in the Constitution. I remain of the opinion that "because of its
            surrender, no immunity exists that can be the subject of a congressional declaration or
            a voluntary waiver," 411 U. S., at 300, and thus have no occasion to inquire whether or
            not Congress authorized an action for AABD retroactive benefits, or whether or not
            Illinois voluntarily waived the immunity by its continued participation in the program
            against the background of precedents which sustained judgments ordering retroactive
            payments.</p>
         <p>I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="dissent" judge="marshall2"><p>MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins,
            dissenting.</p>
         <p>The Social Security Act's categorical assistance programs, including the Aid to the
            Aged, Blind, or Disabled (AABD) program involved here, are fundamentally different from
            most federal legislation. Unlike the Fair Labor Standards Act involved in last Term's
            decision in Employees v. Department of Public Health and Welfare, 411 U. S. 279 (1973),
            or the Federal Employers' Liability Act at issue in Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S.
            184 (1964), the Social Security Act does not impose federal standards and liability upon
            all who engage in certain regulated activities, including often-unwilling state
            agencies. Instead, the Act seeks to induce state participation in the federal welfare
            programs by offering federal matching funds in exchange for the State's voluntary
            assumption of the Act's requirements. I find this basic distinction crucial: it leads me
            to conclude that by participation in the programs, the States waive whatever immunity
            they might otherwise have from federal court <span class="star-pagination">*689</span>
            orders requiring retroactive payment of welfare benefits.<span class="sup">[1]</span>
         </p>
         <p>In its contacts with the Social Security Act's assistance programs in recent years, the
            Court has frequently described the Act as a "scheme of cooperative federalism." See, e.
            g., King v. Smith, 392 U. S. 309, 316 (1968); Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U. S. 535, 542
            (1972). While this phrase captures a number of the unique characteristics of these
            programs, for present purposes it serves to emphasize that the States' decision to
            participate in the programs is a voluntary one. In deciding to participate, however, the
            States necessarily give up their freedom to operate assistance programs for the needy as
            they see fit, and bind themselves to conform their programs to the requirements of the
            federal statute and regulations. As the Court explained in King v. Smith, supra, at
            316-317 (citations omitted):</p> "States are not required to participate in the program,
         but those which desire to take advantage of the substantial federal funds available for
         distribution to needy children [or needy aged, blind or disabled] are required to submit an
         AFDC [or AABD] plan for the approval of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare
         (HEW). The plan must conform with several requirements of the Social Security Act and with
         rules and regulations promulgated by HEW." <p>So here, Illinois elected to participate in
            the AABD program, and received and expended substantial federal funds in the years at
            issue. It thereby obligated itself to comply with federal law, including the requirement
               <span class="star-pagination">*690</span> of former 42 U. S. C. § 1382 (a) (8) that
            "such aid or assistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible
            individuals." In Townsend v. Swank, 404 U. S. 282, 286 (1971), we held that
            participating States must strictly comply with the requirement that aid be furnished "to
            all eligible individuals," and that the States have no power to impose additional
            eligibility requirements which exclude persons eligible for assistance under federal
            standards. Today's decision, ante, at 659-660, n. 8. properly emphasizes that
            participating States must also comply strictly with the "reasonable promptness"
            requirement and the more detailed regulations adding content to it.</p>
         <p>In agreeing to comply with the requirements of the Social Security Act and HEW
            regulations, I believe that Illinois has also agreed to subject itself to suit in the
            federal courts to enforce these obligations. I recognize, of course, that the Social
            Security Act does not itself provide for a cause of action to enforce its obligations.
            As the Court points out, the only sanction expressly provided in the Act for a
            participating State's failure to comply with federal requirements is the cutoff of
            federal funding by the Secretary of HEW. Former 42 U. S. C. § 1384 (now 42 U. S. C. §
            804 (1970 ed., Supp. II)).</p>
         <p>But a cause of action is clearly provided by 42 U. S. C. § 1983, which in terms
            authorizes suits to redress deprivations of rights secured by the "laws" of the United
            States. And we have already rejected the argument that Congress intended the funding
            cutoff to be the sole remedy for noncompliance with federal requirements. In Rosado v.
            Wyman, 397 U. S. 397, 420-423 (1970), we held that suits in federal court under § 1983
            were proper to enforce the provisions of the Social Security Act against participating
            States. Mr. Justice Harlan, writing for the Court, examined <span
               class="star-pagination">*691</span> the legislative history and found "not the
            slightest indication" that Congress intended to prohibit suits in federal court to
            enforce compliance with federal standards. Id., at 422.</p>
         <p>I believe that Congress also intended the full panoply of traditional judicial remedies
            to be available to the federal courts in these § 1983 suits. There is surely no
            indication of any congressional intent to restrict the courts' equitable jurisdiction.
            Yet the Court has held that "[u]nless a statute in so many words, or by a necessary and
            inescapable inference, restricts the court's jurisdiction in equity, the full scope of
            that jurisdiction is to be recognized and applied." Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.
            S. 395, 398 (1946). "When Congress entrusts to an equity court the enforcement of
            prohibitions contained in a regulatory enactment, it must be taken to have acted
            cognizant of the historic power of equity to provide complete relief in light of the
            statutory purposes." Mitchell v. DeMario Jewelry, 361 U. S. 288, 291-292 (1960).</p>
         <p>In particular, I am firmly convinced that Congress intended the restitution of
            wrongfully withheld assistance payments to be a remedy available to the federal courts
            in these suits. Benefits under the categorical assistance programs "are a matter of
            statutory entitlement for persons qualified to receive them." Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.
            S. 254, 262 (1970). Retroactive payment of benefits secures for recipients this
            entitlement which was withheld in violation of federal law. Equally important, the
            courts' power to order retroactive payments is an essential remedy to insure future
            state compliance with federal requirements. See Porter v. Warner Holding Co., supra, at
            400. No other remedy can effectively deter States from the strong temptation to cut
               <span class="star-pagination">*692</span> welfare budgets by circumventing the
            stringent requirements of federal law. The funding cutoff is a drastic sanction, one
            which HEW has proved unwilling or unable to employ to compel strict compliance with the
            Act and regulations. See Rosado v. Wyman, supra, at 426 (DOUGLAS, J., concurring).
            Moreover, the cutoff operates only prospectively; it in no way deters the States from
            even a flagrant violation of the Act's requirements for as long as HEW does not discover
            the violation and threaten to take such action.</p>
         <p>Absent any remedy which may act with retroactive effect, state welfare officials have
            everything to gain and nothing to lose by failing to comply with the congressional
            mandate that assistance be paid with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.
            This is not idle speculation without basis in practical experience. In this very case,
            for example, Illinois officials have knowingly violated since 1968 federal regulations
            on the strength of an argument as to its invalidity which even the majority deems
            unworthy of discussion. Ante, at 659-660, n. 8. Without a retroactive-payment remedy, we
            are indeed faced with "the specter of a state, perhaps calculatingly, defying federal
            law and thereby depriving welfare recipients of the financial assistance Congress
            thought it was giving them." Jordan v. Weaver, 472 F. 2d 985, 995 (CA7 1972). Like the
            Court of Appeals, I cannot believe that Congress could possibly have intended any such
            result.</p>
         <p>Such indicia of congressional intent as can be gleaned from the statute confirm that
            Congress intended to authorize retroactive payment of assistance benefits unlawfully
            withheld. Availability of such payments is implicit in the "fair hearing" requirement,
            former 42 U. S. C. § 1382 (a) (4), which permitted welfare recipients to challenge the
            denial of assistance. The regulations <span class="star-pagination">*693</span> which
            require States to make corrective payments retro-actively in the event of a successful
            fair hearing challenge, 45 CFR § 205.10 (a) (18), merely confirm the obvious statutory
            intent. HEW regulations also authorize federal matching funds for retroactive assistance
            payments made pursuant to court order, 45 CFR §§ 205.10 (b) (2), (b) (3). We should not
            lightly disregard this explicit recognition by the agency charged with administration of
            the statute that such a remedy was authorized by Congress. See Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,
            401 U. S. 424, 433-434 (1971).</p>
         <p>Illinois chose to participate in the AABD program with its eyes wide open. Drawn by the
            lure of federal funds, it voluntarily obligated itself to comply with the Social
            Security Act and HEW regulations, with full knowledge that Congress had authorized
            assistance recipients to go into federal court to enforce these obligations and to
            recover benefits wrongfully denied. Any doubts on this score must surely have been
            removed by our decisions in Rosado v. Wyman, supra, and Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S.
            618 (1969), where we affirmed a district court retroactive payment order. I cannot avoid
            the conclusion that, by virtue of its knowing and voluntary decision to nevertheless
            participate in the program, the State necessarily consented to subject itself to these
            suits. I have no quarrel with the Court's view that waiver of constitutional rights
            should not lightly be inferred. But I simply cannot believe that the State could have
            entered into this essentially contractual agreement with the Federal Government without
            recognizing that it was subjecting itself to the full scope of the § 1983 remedy
            provided by Congress to enforce the terms of the agreement.</p>
         <p>Of course, § 1983 suits are nominally brought against state officers, rather than the
            State itself, and do not <span class="star-pagination">*694</span> ordinarily raise
            Eleventh Amendment problems in view of this Court's decision in Ex parte Young, 209 U.
            S. 123 (1908). But to the extent that the relief authorized by Congress in an action
            under § 1983 may be open to Eleventh Amendment objections,<span class="sup">[2]</span>
            these objections are waived when the State agrees to comply with federal requirements
            enforceable in such an action. I do not find persuasive the Court's reliance in this
            case on the fact that "congressional authorization to sue a class of defendants which
            literally includes States" is absent. Ante, at 672. While true, this fact is irrelevant
            here, for this is simply not a case "literally" against the State. While the Court
            successfully knocks down the strawman it has thus set up, it never comes to grips with
            the undeniable fact that Congress has "literally" authorized this suit within the terms
            of § 1983. Since there is every reason to believe that Congress intended the full
            panoply of judicial remedies to be available in § 1983 equitable actions to enforce the
            Social Security Act, I think the conclusion is inescapable that Congress authorized and
            the State consented to § 1983 actions in which the relief might otherwise be questioned
            on Eleventh Amendment grounds.</p>
         <p>My conclusion that the State has waived its Eleventh Amendment objections to
            court-ordered retroactive assistance payments is fully consistent with last Term's <span
               class="star-pagination">*695</span> decision in Employees v. Department of Public
            Health and Welfare, 411 U. S. 279 (1973). As I emphasized in my concurring opinion,
            there was no voluntary action by the State in Employees which could reasonably be
            construed as evidencing its consent to suit in a federal forum.</p> "[T]he State was
         fully engaged in the operation of the affected hospitals and schools at the time of the
         1966 amendments. To suggest that the State had the choice of either ceasing operation of
         these vital public services or `consenting' to federal suit suffices, I believe, to
         demonstrate that the State had no true choice at all and thereby that the State did not
         voluntarily consent to the exercise of federal jurisdiction. . . ." Id., at 296. <p>A
            finding of waiver here is also consistent with the reasoning of the majority in
            Employees, which relied on a distinction between "governmental" and "proprietary"
            functions of state government. Id., at 284-285. This distinction apparently recognizes
            that if sovereign immunity is to be at all meaningful, the Court must be reluctant to
            hold a State to have waived its immunity simply by acting in its sovereign
            capacity&#x97;i. e., by merely performing its "governmental" functions. On the other
            hand, in launching a profitmaking enterprise, "a State leaves the sphere that is
            exclusively its own," Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S., at 196, and a voluntary
            waiver of sovereign immunity can more easily be found. While conducting an assistance
            program for the needy is surely a "governmental" function, the State here has done far
            more than operate its own program in its sovereign capacity. It has voluntarily
            subordinated its sovereignty in this matter to that of the Federal Government, and
            agreed to comply with the conditions imposed <span class="star-pagination">*696</span>
            by Congress upon the expenditure of federal funds. In entering this federal-state
            cooperative program, the State again "leaves the sphere that is exclusively its own,"
            and similarly may more readily be found to have voluntarily waived its immunity.</p>
         <p>Indeed, this is the lesson to be drawn from this Court's decision in Petty v.
            Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm'n, 359 U. S. 275 (1959), where the Court found that the
            States had waived the sovereign immunity of the Commission by joining in an interstate
            compact subject to the approval of Congress. The Court in Petty emphasized that it was
            "called on to interpret not unilateral state action but the terms of a consensual
            agreement" between the States and Congress, id., at 279, and held that the States who
            join such a consensual agreement, "by accepting it and acting under it assume the
            conditions that Congress under the Constitution attached." Id., at 281-282. Although the
            congressional intent regarding the sue-and-be-sued clause was by no means certain, the
            Court held that the surrounding conditions made it clear that the States accepting it
            waived their sovereign immunity, id., at 280, especially since this interpretation was
            necessary to keep the compact "a living interstate agreement which performs high
            functions in our federalism." Id., at 279.</p>
         <p>I find the approach in Petty controlling here. As even the dissent in that case
            recognized, id., at 285 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting), Congress undoubtedly has the
            power to insist upon a waiver of sovereign immunity as a condition of its consent to
            such a federal-state agreement. Since I am satisfied that Congress has in fact done so
            here, at least to the extent that the federal courts may do "complete rather than
            truncated justice," Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U. S., at 398, in § 1983 actions
            authorized by Congress against state welfare authorities, I respectfully dissent.</p>

            the equal protection claim cannot be said to be "wholly insubstantial," and that

            and employees, and all persons in active concert and participation with them, are hereby
            enjoined to release and remit AABD benefits wrongfully withheld to all applicants for
            AABD in the State of Illinois who applied between July 1, 1968 and April 16, 1972 [sic]
            [should read "1971"], and were determined eligible, as follows:</p>
         <p>"(a) For those aged and blind applicants whose first full AABD check was not mailed
            within thirty days from the date of application, AABD assistance for the period
            beginning with the thirtieth day from the date of application to the date the
            applicant's entitlement to AABD became effective;</p>
         <p>"(b) (i) For those disabled applicants who applied between July 1, 1968 and December 31,
            1970, whose first full AABD check was not mailed within forty-five days from the date of
            application, AABD assistance for the period beginning with the forty-fifth day from the
            date of application to the date the applicant's entitlement became effective;</p>
         <p>"(ii) For those disabled applicants who applied between January 1, 1971 and April 16,
            1971, whose first full AABD check was not mailed within sixty days from the date of
            application, AABD assistance for the period beginning with the sixtieth day from the
            date of application to the date the applicant's entitlement became effective.</p>
         <p>"These AABD benefits shall be mailed to those persons currently receiving AABD within
            eight months with an explanatory letter, said letter having been first approved by
            plaintiffs' attorney. Any AABD benefits received pursuant to this paragraph shall not be
            deemed income or resources under Article III of the Illinois Public Aid Code.</p>
         <p>"For those persons not presently receiving AABD:</p>
         <p>"(a) A certified letter (return receipt requested), said letter having been first
            approved by plaintiffs' attorney, shall be sent to the last known address of the person,
            informing him in concise and easily understandable terms that he is entitled to a
            specified amount of AABD benefits wrongfully withheld, and that he may claim such amount
            by contacting the County Department of Public Aid at a specified address, within 45 days
            from the receipt of said letter.</p>
         <p>"(b) If the County Department of Public Aid does not receive a claim for the AABD
            benefits within 45 days from the date of actual notice to the person, the right to said
            AABD benefits shall be forfeited and the file shall be closed. Persons who do not
            receive actual notice do not forfeit their rights to AABD benefits wrongfully withheld
            under this provision."</p>
         <p>Paragraph 6 of the District Court's judgment provided:</p>
         <p>"Within 15 days from the date of this decree, defendant EDWARD T. WEAVER, Director,
            Illinois Department of Public Aid, shall submit to the court and the plaintiffs'
            attorney a detailed statement as to the method for effectuating the relief required by
            paragraph 5, supra, of this Decree. Any disputes between the parties as to whether the
            procedures and steps outlined by the defendant WEAVER will fulfill the requirements of
            this Decree will be resolved by the Court."</p>
         <p>On July 19, 1973, the author of this opinion stayed until further order of this Court
            these two paragraphs of the District Court's judgment. 414 U. S. 1301.</p>
         <p>[6] Respondent appealed from the District Court's judgment insofar as it held him not
            entitled to receive benefits from the date of his applications (as opposed to the date
            of authorization of benefits as provided by the federal regulations) and insofar as it
            failed to award punitive damages. The Court of Appeals upheld the District Court's
            decision against respondent on those points and they are not at issue here. 472 F. 2d
            985, 997-999.</p>
         <p>[7] Citing Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97 (1971), petitioner also contends in
            this Court that the Court of Appeals erred in refusing to give the District Court's
            judgment prospective effect only. Brief for Petitioner 37, incorporating arguments made
            in Pet. for Cert. 18-22. The Court of Appeals concluded that this ground was "not
            presented to the district judge before the entry of judgment, so that it comes too
            late." 472 F. 2d, at 995. The Court of Appeals went on, however, to conclude that
            "[e]ven if the ground had been timely presented, defendants' contention would be
            meritless." Ibid. Nothing that one of three tests established by our decision in Huson
            for determining the retroactivity of court decisions was that "the decision to be
            applied nonretroactively must establish a new principle of law, either by overruling
            clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied . . . or [have decided] an issue
            of first impression whose resolution was not clearly fore-shadowed. . . ," Chevron Oil
            Co. v. Huson, supra, at 106, the Court of Appeals found that the petitioner had not
            satisfied this test, since the "federal time requirements for processing applications
            and paying eligible AABD applicants were made effective July 1, 1968, and defendants
            were well aware of these mandatory maximum permissible time standards." 472 F. 2d, at
            996. </p>
         <p>In light of our disposition of this case on the Eleventh Amendment issue we see no
            reason to address this contention.</p>
         <p>[8] Former Title 42 U. S. C. § 1382 (a) (8) provided in pertinent part: </p>
         <p>"(a) Contents.</p>
         <p>"A State plan for aid to the aged, blind, or disabled, or for aid to the aged, blind, or
            disabled and medical assistance for the aged, must&#x97;</p>
         <p>.....</p>
         <p>"(8) provide that all individuals wishing to make application for aid or assistance
            under the plan shall have opportunity to do so, and that such aid or assistance shall be
            furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals."</p>
         <p>HEW, pursuant to authority granted to it by 42 U. S. C. § 1302, has promulgated
            regulations, see n. 3, supra, which require that decisions be made promptly on
            applications within 45 days for the aged and blind and within 60 days for the disabled,
            and that initiation of payments to the eligible be made within the same periods.
            Petitioner renews in this Court the contention made in the Court of Appeals that these
            time limitations in the regulations are inconsistent with the statute and therefore an
            unlawful abuse of the rule-making authority. Brief for Petitioner 37, incorporating
            arguments made in Pet. for Cert. 22-28. Specifically, petitioner argues that the
            "establishment of arbitrary [forty-five] and sixty day maximums in the HEW regulations
            for determination of eligibility and initiation of payments without taking into
            consideration the efficient administration of the Act by the State agencies is
            inconsistent with the `reasonable promptness' requirement and must therefore be declared
            unlawful . . . ." Pet. for Cert. 23. The Court of Appeals rejected this contention,
            holding that "these time requirements, binding on state welfare officials, are an
            appropriate interpretation of the Congressional mandate of `reasonable promptness.' "
            472 F. 2d, at 996. We agree with the Court of Appeals.</p>
         <p>[9] While the debates of the Constitutional Convention themselves do not disclose a
            discussion of the question, the prevailing view at the time of the ratification of the
            Constitution was stated by various of the Framers in the writings and debates of the
            period. Examples of these views have been assembled by Mr. Chief Justice Hughes: </p>
         <p>". . . Madison, in the Virginia Convention, answering objections to the ratification of
            the Constitution, clearly stated his view as to the purpose and effect of the provision
            conferring jurisdiction over controversies between States of the Union and foreign
            States. That purpose was suitably to provide for adjudication in such cases if consent
            should be given but not otherwise. Madison said: `The next case provides for disputes
            between a foreign state and one of our states, should such a case ever arise; and
            between a citizen and a foreign citizen or subject. I do not conceive that any
            controversy can ever be decided, in these courts, between an American state and a
            foreign state, without the consent of the parties. If they consent, provision is here
            made.' 3 Elliot's Debates, 533.</p>
         <p>"Marshall, in the same Convention, expressed a similar view. Replying to an objection as
            to the admissibility of a suit by a foreign state, Marshall said: `He objects, in the
            next place, to its jurisdiction in controversies between a state and a foreign state.
            Suppose, says he, in such a suit, a foreign state is cast; will she be bound by the
            decision? If a foreign state brought a suit against the commonwealth of Virginia, would
            she not be barred from the claim if the federal judiciary thought it unjust? The
            previous consent of the parties is necessary; and, as the federal judiciary will decide,
            each party will acquiesce.' 3 Elliot's Debates, 557.</p>
         <p>"Hamilton, in The Federalist, No. 81, made the following emphatic statement of the
            general principle of immunity: `It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be
            amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent. This is the general sense and
            the general practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of the attributes of
            sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every State in the Union. Unless,
            therefore, there is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it will
            remain with the States, and the danger intimated must be merely ideal. The circumstances
            which are necessary to produce an alienation of State sovereignty were discussed in
            considering the article of taxation and need not be repeated here. A recurrence to the
            principles there established will satisfy us that there is no color to pretend that the
            State governments would by the adoption of that plan be divested of the privilege of
            paying their own debts in their own way, free from every constraint but that which flows
            from the obligations of good faith. The contracts between a nation and individuals are
            only binding on the conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretensions to a compulsive
            force. They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign will. To what purpose
            would it be to authorize suits against States for the debts they owe? How could
            recoveries be enforced? It is evident it could not be done without waging war against
            the contracting State; and to ascribe to the federal courts by mere implication, and in
            destruction of a preexisting right of the State governments, a power which would involve
            such a consequence would be altogether forced and unwarrantable.' " Monaco v.
            Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 323-325 (1934) (footnotes omitted).</p>
         <p>[10] Of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, sitting by
            designation on the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</p>
         <p>[11] It may be true, as stated by our Brother DOUGLAS in dissent, that "[m]ost welfare
            decisions by federal courts have a financial impact on the States." Post, at 680-681.
            But we cannot agree that such a financial impact is the same where a federal court
            applies Ex parte Young to grant prospective declaratory and injunctive relief, as
            opposed to an order of retroactive payments as was made in the instant case. It is not
            necessarily true that "[w]hether the decree is prospective only or requires payments for
            the weeks or months wrongfully skipped over by the state officials, the nature of the
            impact on the state treasury is precisely the same." Post, at 682. This argument
            neglects the fact that where the State has a definable allocation to be used in the
            payment of public aid benefits, and pursues a certain course of action such as the
            processing of applications within certain time periods as did Illinois here, the
            subsequent ordering by a federal court of retroactive payments to correct delays in such
            processing will invariably mean there is less money available for payments for the
            continuing obligations of the public aid system. </p>
         <p>As stated by Judge McGowan in Rothstein v. Wyman, 467 F. 2d 226, 235 (CA2 1972):</p>
         <p>"The second federal policy which might arguably be furthered by retroactive payments is
            the fundamental goal of congressional welfare legislation&#x97;the satisfaction of the
            ascertained needs of impoverished persons. Federal standards are designed to ensure that
            those needs are equitably met; and there may perhaps be cases in which the prompt
            payment of funds wrongfully withheld will serve that end. As time goes by, however,
            retroactive payments become compensatory rather than remedial; the coincidence between
            previously ascertained and existing needs becomes less clear."</p>
         <p>[12] The Court of Appeals considered the Court's decision in Griffin v. School Board,
            377 U. S. 218 (1964), to be of like import. But as may be seen from Griffin's citation
            of Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U. S. 529 (1890), a county does not occupy the same
            position as a State for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment. See also Moor v. County of
            Alameda, 411 U. S. 693 (1973). The fact that the county policies executed by the county
            officials in Griffin were subject to the commands of the Fourteenth Amendment, but the
            county was not able to invoke the protection of the Eleventh Amendment, is no more than
            a recognition of the long-established rule that while county action is generally state
            action for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, a county defendant is not necessarily a
            state defendant for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment.</p>

         <p>[14] In the words of Mr. Justice Brandeis: "Stare decisis is usually the wise policy,
            because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled
            than that it be settled right. . . . This is commonly true even where the error is a
            matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation. But in cases
            involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is
            practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions. The Court
            bows to the lessons of experience and the force of better reasoning, recognizing that
            the process of trial and error, so fruitful in the physical sciences, is appropriate
            also in the judicial function." Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp;amp; Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393,
            406-408 (1932) (dissenting opinion) (footnotes omitted).</p>
         <p>[15] Respondent urges that the traditionally broad power of a federal court sitting as a
            court of equity to fashion appropriate remedies as are necessary to effect congressional
            purposes requires that the District Court's award of retroactive benefits be upheld.
            Respondent places principal reliance on our prior decisions in Porter v. Warner Holding
            Co., 328 U. S. 395 (1946), and Mitchell v. DeMario Jewelry, 361 U. S. 288 (1960). Both
            cases dealt with the power of a federal court to grant equitable relief for violations
            of federal law; the decision in Mitchell indicated that a federal court could provide
            equitable relief "complete . . . in light of the statutory purposes." Id., at 292. Since
            neither of these cases involved a suit against a State or a state official, it did not
            purport to decide the availability of equitable relief consistent with the Eleventh
            Amendment.</p>
         <p>[16] HEW sought passage of a bill in the 91st Congress. H. R. 16311, § 407 (a), which
            would have given it authority to require retroactive payments to eligible persons denied
            such benefits. The bill failed to pass the House of Representatives. See H. R. 16311,
            The Family Assistance Act of 1970, Senate Committee on Finance, 91st Cong., 2d Sess.,
            C169-170 (Comm. Print Nov. 5, 1970).</p>
         <p>[17] Title 45 CFR §§ 205.10 (b) (2) and (3) provide: </p>
         <p>"(b) Federal financial participation. Federal financial participation is available for
            the following items:</p>
         <p>.....</p>
         <p>"(2) Payments of assistance made to carry out hearing decisions, or to take corrective
            action after an appeal but prior to hearing, or to extend the benefit of a hearing
            decision or court order to others in the same situation as those directly affected by
            the decision or order. Such payments may be retroactive in accordance with applicable
            Federal policies on corrective payments.</p>
         <p>"(3) Payments of assistance within the scope of Federally aided public assistance
            programs made in accordance with a court order."</p>
         <p>The Court of Appeals felt that § 1983, the enactment of the AABD program, and the
            issuance by HEW of the above regulation, indicated that Congress intended to include
            within the Social Security Act the remedy of "effective judicial review" and "the remedy
            of restoration of benefits withheld in violation of federal law." 472 F. 2d, at 994-995
            and n. 15. But the adoption of regulations by HEW to permit the use of federal funds in
            the satisfaction of judicial awards is not determinative of the constitutional issues
            here presented.</p>
         <p>[18] MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and both the Court of Appeals and the respondent herein,
            refer to language in Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U. S., at 420, to the effect that Congress in
            legislating the Social Security Act has not "closed the avenue of effective judicial
            review to those individuals most directly affected by the administration of its
            program." The Court in Rosado was concerned with the compatibility of a provision of New
            York law which decreased benefits to some eligible public aid recipients and amendments
            to the federal act which required cost-of-living increases. The case did not purport to
            decide the Eleventh Amendment issue we resolve today. In finding the New York law
            inconsistent with the federal law, Mr. Justice Harlan stated: </p>
         <p>"New York is, of course, in no way prohibited from using only state funds according to
            whatever plan it chooses, providing it violates no provision of the Constitution. It
            follows, however, from our conclusion that New York's program is incompatible with § 402
            (a) (23), that petitioners are entitled to declaratory relief and an appropriate
            injunction by the District Court against the payment of federal monies according to the
            new schedules, should the State not develop a conforming plan within a reasonable period
            of time.</p>
         <p>"We have considered and rejected the argument that a federal court is without power to
            review state welfare provisions or prohibit the use of federal funds by the States in
            view of the fact that Congress has lodged in the Department of HEW the power to cut off
            federal funds for noncompliance with statutory requirements. We are most reluctant to
            assume Congress has closed the avenue of effective judicial review to those individuals
            most directly affected by the administration of its program. . . . We adhere to King v.
            Smith, 392 U. S. 309 (1968), which implicitly rejected the argument that the statutory
            provisions for HEW review of plans should be read to curtail judicial relief and held
            Alabama's `substitute father' regulation to be inconsistent with the federal statute.
            While King did not advert specifically to the remedial problem, the unarticulated
            premise was that the State had alternative choices of assuming the additional cost of
            paying benefits to families with substitute fathers or not using federal funds to pay
            welfare benefits according to a plan that was inconsistent with federal requirements."
            Id., at 420-421.</p>
         <p>Respondent urges that this language is "tantamount to a finding that Congress
            conditioned the participation of a state in the categorical assistance program on the
            forfeiture of immunity from suit in a federal forum . . . irrespective of the relief
            sought, [since] the intent of Congress remains constant." Brief for Respondent 42-43.
            Petitioner contends that this language, coupled with the fact that the Court in Rosado
            remanded the case to the District Court to "afford New York an opportunity to revise its
            program . . . or, should New York choose [not to revise its program], issue its order
            restraining the further use of federal monies pursuant to the present statute," 397 U.
            S., at 421-422, indicates that the Court felt that retroactive relief was not a
            permissible remedy. Brief for Petitioner 17-20. We do not regard Rosado as controlling
            either way since the Court was not faced with a district court judgment ordering
            retroactive payments or with a challenge based on the Eleventh Amendment.</p>
         <p>[19] Respondent urges that the State of Illinois has abolished its common-law sovereign
            immunity in its state courts, and appears to argue that suit in a federal court against
            the State may thus be maintained. Brief for Respondent 23. Petitioner contends that
            sovereign immunity has not been abolished in Illinois as to this type of case. Brief for
            Petitioner 31-36. Whether Illinois permits such a suit to be brought against the State
            in its own courts is not determinative of whether Illinois has relinquished its Eleventh
            Amendment immunity from suit in the federal courts. Chandler v. Dix, 194 U. S. 590,
            591-592 (1904).</p>
         <p>[1] Effective January 1, 1974, this AABD program was replaced by a similar program. See
            42 U. S. C. §§ 801-805 (1970 ed., Supp. II). The program in Illinois is administered by
            the Department of Public Aid. Ill. Rev. Stat., c. 23, §§ 3-1 to 3-12 (1973). The former
            program was funded in part by the State and in part by the Federal Government. 42 U. S.
            C. §§ 303, 304, 306, 1201-1204, 1206, 1351-1355, 1381-1385.</p>
         <p>[2] The Eleventh Amendment provides: "The Judicial power of the United States shall not
            be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one
            of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any
            Foreign State." </p>
         <p>As the Court, speaking through MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, said in Parden v. Terminal R. Co.,
            377 U. S. 184, 186: "Although the Eleventh Amendment is not in terms applicable here,
            since petitioners are citizens of Alabama, this Court has recognized that an
            unconsenting State is immune from federal-court suits brought by its own citizens as
            well as by citizens of another State. Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1; Duhne v. New
            Jersey, 251 U. S. 311; Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51; Fitts v.
            McGhee, 172 U. S. 516, 524. See also Monaco v. Mississippi. 292 U. S. 313."</p>
         <p>[3] The Social Security Act states what a "state plan" must provide. At the time this
            suit was brought, 42 U. S. C. § 1382 (a) provided: </p>
         <p>"A State plan for aid to the aged, blind, or disabled, or for aid to the aged, blind, or
            disabled and medical assistance for the aged, must . . . .</p>
         <p>.....</p>
         <p>"(5) provide (A) such methods of administration . . . as are found by the Secretary to
            be necessary for the proper and efficient operation of the plan . . . ;</p>
         <p>.....</p>
         <p>"(8) provide that all individuals wishing to make application for aid or assistance
            under the plan shall have opportunity to do so, and that such aid or assistance shall be
            furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals;</p>
         <p>.....</p>
         <p>"(13) include reasonable standards, consistent with the objectives of this subchapter,
            for determining eligibility for and the extent of aid or assistance under the plan."</p>
         <p>Nearly identical provisions are now found in 42 U. S. C. § 802 (a) (1970 ed., Supp.
            II).</p>
         <p>The Secretary of HEW issued mandatory federal time standard regulations. Handbook,
            Public Assistance Administration, pt. IV, §§ 2200 (b) (3), 2300 (b) (5); 45 CFR § 206.10
            (a) (3). Illinois adopted a 30-day standard for aged and blind applicants (Ill. Categ.
            Assistance Manual § 4004.1) as contrasted to HEW's 60-day period, § 2200, supra. It is
            that conflict which exposes the merits of the controversy.</p>

         <p>[5] The jurisdictional statement had as its second question the following: </p>
         <p>"Whether a federal court is precluded by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States
            Constitution from ordering a state agency to pay money from the state treasury and from
            further ordering the state agency to perform certain specified acts which would
            otherwise be in the discretion of the agency."</p>

         <p>[8] Id., at 338 n. 5. The award of money damages was alleged to be a violation of the
            Eleventh Amendment in Part V of the jurisdictional statement.</p>
         <p>[9] The jurisdictional statement in the Sterrett case explicitly urged that the decree
            below violated the Eleventh Amendment since it would expend itself on the public
            treasury&#x97;the second question in the jurisdictional statement.</p>
         <p>[10] We settled in Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U. S. 397, the question whether the grant of
            authority under the Social Security Act to HEW to cut off federal funds for
            noncompliance with statutory requirements provides the exclusive procedure and remedy
            for violations of the Act. We said: "We are most reluctant to assume Congress has closed
            the avenue of effective judicial review to those individuals most directly affected by
            the administration of its program." Id., at 420.</p>
         <p>[1] In view of my conclusion on this issue, I find it unnecessary to consider whether
            the Court correctly treats this suit as one against the State, rather than as a suit
            against a state officer permissible under the rationale of Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123
            (1908).</p>
         <p>[2] It should be noted that there has been no determination in this case that state
            action is unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, the Court necessarily
            does not decide whether the States' Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity may have been
            limited by the later enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment to the extent that such a
            limitation is necessary to effectuate the purposes of that Amendment, an argument
            advanced by an amicus in this case. In view of my conclusion that any sovereign immunity
            which may exist has been waived, I also need not reach this issue.</p>
