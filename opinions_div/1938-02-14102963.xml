         </span> (1938) SOUTH CAROLINA STATE HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT ET AL. v. BARNWELL BROTHERS, INC.,
         ET AL. No. 161. <p>Supreme Court of United States.</p> Argued January 4, 1938. Decided
         February 14, 1938. APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE EASTERN
         DISTRICT OF SOUTH CAROLINA. <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*180</span> Messrs. Steve C. Griffith and Thomas W. Davis
            with whom Messrs. John M. Daniel, Attorney General, J. Ivey Humphrey and M.J. Hough,
            Assistant Attorneys General, of South Carolina, Eugene S. Blease, Douglas McKay, M.G.
            McDonald, and J.B.S. Lyles were on the briefs, for appellants.</p>
         <p>Messrs. S. King Funkhouser and Frank Coleman, with whom Mr. J. Ninian Beall was on the
            brief, for appellees.</p>
         <p>MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
         <p>Act No. 259 of the General Assembly of South Carolina, of April 28, 1933, 38 Stat. 340,
            prohibits use on the state highways of motor trucks and "semi-trailer motor trucks"
            whose width exceeds 90 inches, and whose weight including load exceeds 20,000 pounds.
            For purposes of the weight limitation § 2 of the statute provides that a semi-trailer
            motor truck, which is a motor propelled truck with a trailer whose front end is designed
            to be attached to and supported by the truck, shall be considered a single unit. The
            principal question for decision is whether these prohibitions impose an unconstitutional
            burden upon interstate commerce.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*181</span> Appellees include the original plaintiffs
            below, who are truckers and interstate shippers; the Interstate Commerce Commission; and
            certain others who were permitted to intervene as parties plaintiff. The suit was
            brought in the district court for eastern South Carolina against various state
            officials, to enjoin them from enforcing §§ 4 and 6 of the Act among others,<span
               class="sup">[1]</span> on the ground that they have been superseded by the Federal
            Motor Carrier Act of 1935, c. 498, 49 Stat. 546; that they infringe the due process
            clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and that they impose an unconstitutional burden on
            interstate commerce. Certain railroads interested in restricting the competition of
            interstate motor carriers were permitted to intervene as parties defendant.</p>
         <p>The district court of three judges, after hearing evidence, ruled that the challenged
            provisions of the statute have not been superseded by the Federal Motor Carrier Act, and
            adopted as its own the ruling of the state Supreme Court in State ex rel. Daniel v. John
            P. Nutt Co., 180 S.C. 19; <span class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">185</span>
               <span class="reporter">S.E.</span>
               <span class="page">25</span>
            </span>, that the challenged provisions, being an exercise of the state's power to
            regulate the use of its highways so as to protect them from injury and to insure their
            safe and economical use, do not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. But it held that the
            weight and width prohibitions place an unlawful burden on interstate motor traffic
            passing over specified highways of the state, which for the most part are of concrete or
            a concrete base surfaced with asphalt. It accordingly enjoined the enforcement of the
            weight provision against interstate motor carriers on the specified highways, and also
               <span class="star-pagination">*182</span> the width limitation of 90 inches, except
            in the case of vehicles exceeding 96 inches in width. It exempted from the operation of
            the decree, bridges on those highways "not constructed with sufficient strength to
            support the heavy trucks of modern traffic or too narrow to accommodate such traffic
            safely," provided the state highway department should place at each end of the bridge
            proper notices warning that the use of the bridge is forbidden by trucks exceeding the
            weight or width limits and provided the proper authorities take the necessary steps to
            enforce the law against such use of the bridges. The case comes here on appeal under §
            266 of the Judicial Code.</p>
         <p>The trial court rested its decision that the statute unreasonably burdens interstate
            commerce, upon findings, not assailed here, that there is a large amount of motor truck
            traffic passing interstate in the southeastern part of the United States, which would
            normally pass over the highways of South Carolina, but which will be barred from the
            state by the challenged restrictions if enforced, and upon its conclusion that, when
            viewed in the light of their effect upon interstate commerce, these restrictions are
            unreasonable.</p>
         <p>To reach this conclusion the court weighed conflicting evidence and made its own
            determinations as to the weight and width of motor trucks commonly used in interstate
            traffic and the capacity of the specified highways of the state to accommodate such
            traffic without injury to them or danger to their users. It found that interstate
            carriage by motor trucks has become a national industry; that from 85 to 90% of the
            motor trucks used in interstate transportation are 96 inches wide and of a gross weight,
            when loaded, of more than ten tons; that only four other states prescribe a gross load
            weight as low as 20,000 pounds; and that the American Association of State Highway
            Officials and the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety in the Department of
               <span class="star-pagination">*183</span> Commerce have recommended for adoption
            weight and width limitations in which weight is limited to axle loads of 16,000 to
            18,000 pounds and width is limited to 96 inches.</p>
         <p>It found in detail that compliance with the weight and width limitations demanded by the
            South Carolina Act would seriously impede motor truck traffic passing to and through the
            state and increase its cost; that 2,417 miles of state highways, including most of those
            affected by the injunction, are of the standard construction of concrete or concrete
            base with asphalt surface, 7 1/2 or 8 inches thick at the edges and 6 or 6 1/2 inches
            thick at the center; that they are capable of sustaining without injury a wheel load of
            8,000 to 9,000 pounds or an axle load of double those amounts, depending on whether the
            wheels are equipped with high pressure or low pressure pneumatic tires; that all but 100
            miles of the specified highways are from 18 to 20 feet in width; that they constitute a
            connected system of highways which have been improved with the aid of federal money
            grants, as a part of a national system of highways; and that they constitute one of the
            best highways systems in the southeastern part of the United States.</p>
         <p>It also found that the gross weight of vehicles is not a factor to be considered in the
            preservation of concrete highways, but that the appropriate factor to be considered is
            wheel or axle weight; the vehicles engaged in interstate commerce are so designed and
            the pressure of their weight is so distributed by their wheels and axles that gross
            loads of more than 20,000 pounds can be carried over concrete roads without damage to
            the surface; that a gross weight limitation of that amount, especially as applied to
            semi-trailer motor trucks, is unreasonable as a means of preserving the highways; that
            it has no reasonable relation to safety of the public using the highways; and that the
            width limitation of 90 inches is unreasonable <span class="star-pagination">*184</span>
            when applied to standard concrete highways of the state, in view of the fact that all
            other states permit a width of 96 inches, which is the standard width of trucks engaged
            in interstate commerce.</p>
         <p>In reaching these conclusions, and at the same time holding that the weight and width
            limitations do not infringe the Fourteenth Amendment, the court proceeded upon the
            assumption that the commerce clause imposes upon state regulations to secure the safe
            and economical use of highways a standard of reasonableness which is more exacting when
            applied to the interstate traffic than that required by the Fourteenth Amendment as to
            all traffic; that a standard of weight and width of motor vehicles which is an
            appropriate state regulation when applied to intrastate traffic may be prohibited
            because of its effect on interstate commerce, although the conditions attending the two
            classes of traffic with respect to safety and protection of the highways are the
            same.</p>
         <p>South Carolina has built its highways and owns and maintains them. It has received from
            the federal government, in aid of its highway improvements, money grants which have been
            expended upon the highways to which the injunction applies. But appellees do not
            challenge here the ruling of the district court that Congress has not undertaken to
            regulate the weight and size of motor vehicles in interstate motor traffic, and has left
            undisturbed whatever authority in that regard the states have retained under the
            Constitution.</p>
         <p>While the constitutional grant to Congress of power to regulate interstate commerce has
            been held to operate of its own force to curtail state power in some measure,<span
               class="sup">[2]</span>
            <span class="star-pagination">*185</span> it did not forestall all state action
            affecting interstate commerce. Ever since Willson v. Black Bird Creek Marsh Co., <span

               <span class="page">299</span>
            </span>, it has been recognized that there are matters of local concern, the regulation
            of which unavoidably involves some regulation of interstate commerce but which, because
            of their local character and their number and diversity, may never be fully dealt with
            by Congress. Notwithstanding the commerce clause, such regulation in the absence of
            Congressional action has for the most part been left to the states by the decisions of
            this Court, subject to the other applicable constitutional restraints.</p>
         <p>The commerce clause, by its own force, prohibits discrimination against interstate
            commerce, whatever its form or method, and the decisions of this Court have recognized
            that there is scope for its like operation when state legislation nominally of local
            concern is in point of <span class="star-pagination">*186</span> fact aimed at
            interstate commerce, or by its necessary operation is a means of gaining a local benefit

            upon state control of interstate rail carriers so as to preclude the subordination of
            the efficiency and convenience of interstate traffic to local service requirements.<span

            <span class="star-pagination">*187</span> But the present case affords no occasion for
            saying that the bare possession of power by Congress to regulate the interstate traffic
            forces the states to conform to standards which Congress might, but has not adopted, or
            curtails their power to take measures to insure the safety and conservation of their
            highways which may be applied to like traffic moving intrastate. Few subjects of state
            regulation are so peculiarly of local concern as is the use of state highways. There are
            few, local regulation of which is so inseparable from a substantial effect on interstate
            commerce. Unlike the railroads, local highways are built, owned and maintained by the
            state or its municipal subdivisions. The state has a primary and immediate concern in
            their safe and economical administration. The present regulations, or any others of like
            purpose, if they are to accomplish their end, must be applied alike to interstate and
            intrastate traffic both moving in large volume over the highways. The fact that they
            affect alike shippers in interstate and intrastate commerce in large number within as
            well as without the state is a safeguard against their abuse.</p>
         <p>From the beginning it has been recognized that a state can, if it sees fit, build and
            maintain its own highways, canals and railroads and that in the absence of Congressional
            action their regulation is peculiarly within its competence, even though interstate
            commerce is materially affected. Minnesota Rate Cases, <span class="citation">

            upheld regardless of its effect upon interstate commerce. Id. With respect to the extent
            and nature of the local interests to be protected and the unavoidable effect upon
            interstate and intrastate commerce alike, regulations of the use of the highways are
            akin to <span class="star-pagination">*188</span> local regulation of rivers, harbors,
            piers and docks, quarantine regulations, and game laws, which, Congress not acting, have

            <span class="star-pagination">*189</span> The nature of the authority of the state over
            its own highways has often been pointed out by this Court. It may not, under the guise
            of regulation, discriminate against interstate commerce. But "In the absence of national
            legislation especially covering the subject of interstate commerce, the State may
            rightly prescribe uniform regulations adapted to promote safety upon its highways and
            the conservation of their use, applicable alike to vehicles moving in interstate
            commerce and those of its own citizens." Morris v. Duby, <span class="citation">

         <p>In each of these cases regulation involves a burden on interstate commerce. But so long
            as the state action does not discriminate, the burden is one which the Constitution
            permits because it is an inseparable incident of the exercise of a legislative
            authority, which, under the Constitution, has been left to the states.</p>
         <p>Congress, in the exercise of its plenary power to regulate interstate commerce, may
            determine whether the <span class="star-pagination">*190</span> burdens imposed on it by
            state regulation, otherwise permissible, are too great, and may, by legislation designed
            to secure uniformity or in other respects to protect the national interest in the
            commerce, curtail to some extent the state's regulatory power. But that is a
            legislative, not a judicial function, to be performed in the light of the Congressional
            judgment of what is appropriate regulation of interstate commerce, and the extent to
            which, in that field, state power and local interests should be required to yield to the
            national authority and interest. In the absence of such legislation the judicial
            function, under the commerce clause as well as the Fourteenth Amendment, stops with the
            inquiry whether the state legislature in adopting regulations such as the present has
            acted within its province, and whether the means of regulation chosen are reasonably
            adapted to the end sought. Sproles v. Binford, supra; Stephenson v. Binford, <span

         <p>Here the first inquiry has already been resolved by our decisions that a state may
            impose non-discriminatory restrictions with respect to the character of motor vehicles
            moving in interstate commerce as a safety measure and as a means of securing the
            economical use of its highways. In resolving the second, courts do not sit as
            legislatures, either state or national. They cannot act as Congress does when, after
            weighing all the conflicting interests, state and national, it determines when and how
            much the state regulatory power shall yield to the larger interests of a national
            commerce. And in reviewing a state highway regulation where Congress has not acted, a
            court is not called upon, as are state legislatures, to determine what, in its judgment,
            is the most suitable restriction to be applied of those that are possible, or to choose
            that one which in its opinion is best adapted to all the diverse interests affected.

         <p>Since the adoption of one weight or width regulation, rather than another, is a

            affirmatively that there is adequate support for the legislative judgment.</p>
         <p>At the outset it should be noted that underlying much of the controversy is the relative
            merit of a gross weight limitation as against an axle or wheel weight limitation. While
            there is evidence that weight stresses on concrete roads are determined by wheel rather
            than gross load weights, other elements enter into choice of the type of weight
            limitation. There is testimony to show that the axle or wheel weight limitation is the
            more easily enforced through resort to weighing devices adapted to ascertaining readily
            the axle or wheel weight. But it appears that in practice the weight of truck loads is
            not evenly distributed over axles and wheels; that commonly the larger part of the load
            &#x97; sometimes as much as 70 to 80% &#x97; rests on the rear axle and that it is much
            easier for those who load trucks to make certain that they have complied with a gross
            load weight limitation than with an axle or wheel weight limitation. While the report of
            the National Conference on State and Highway Safety, on which the court below relied,
            suggested a wheel weight limitation of 8,000 or 9,000 pounds, it also suggested that a
            gross weight limitation might be adopted and should be subject to the recommended wheel
            limitation. But the conference declined to fix the amount of gross weight limitation,
            saying: "In view of the varying conditions of traffic, and lack of uniformity in highway
            construction in the several States, no uniform gross-weight limitations are here
            recommended for general adoption throughout the country." The choice of a weight
            limitation based on convenience of application and consequent lack of <span
               class="star-pagination">*193</span> need for rigid supervisory enforcement is for the
            legislature, and we cannot say that its preference for the one over the other is in any
            sense arbitrary or unreasonable. The choice is not to be condemned because the
            legislature prefers a workable standard, less likely to be violated than another under
            which the violations will probably be increased but more easily detected. It is for the
            legislature to say whether the one test or the other will in practical operation better
            protect the highways from the risk of excessive loads.</p>
         <p>If gross load weight is adopted as the test it is obvious that the permissible load must
            be somewhat lighter than if the axle or wheel weight test were applied. With the latter
            the gross weight of a loaded motor truck can never exceed twice the axle and four times
            the wheel limit. But the fact that the rear axle may and often does support as much as
            70 or 80% of the gross load, with wheel weight in like proportion, requires that a gross
            load limit be fixed at considerably less than four times the permissible wheel
            limit.</p>
         <p>There was testimony before the court to support its conclusion that the highways in
            question are capable of sustaining without injury a wheel load of 8,000 or 9,000 pounds,
            the difference depending upon the character of the tire in use, as against a wheel load
            of as much as 8,000 pounds, which would be possible under the statutory load limit of
            20,000 pounds as applied to motor trucks, and approximates the axle limit in addition to
            the gross load limit recommended by the National Conference on Street and Highway
            Safety. Much of this testimony appears to have been based on theoretical strength of
            concrete highways laid under ideal conditions, and none of it was based on an actual
            study of the highways of South Carolina or of the subgrade and other road building
            conditions which prevail there and which have a material bearing on the strength and
            durability of such highways. There is <span class="star-pagination">*194</span>
            uncontradicted testimony that approximately 60% of the South Carolina standard paved
            highways in question were built without a longitudinal center joint which has since
            become standard practice, the portion of the concrete surface adjacent to the joint
            being strengthened by reinforcement or by increasing its thickness; and that owing to
            the distribution of the stresses on concrete roads when in use, those without a center
            joint have a tendency to develop irregular longitudinal cracks. As the concrete in the
            center of such roads is thinner than that at the edges, the result is that the highway
            is split into two irregular segments, each with a weak inner edge which, according to
            the expert testimony, is not capable of supporting indefinitely wheel loads in excess of
            4,200 pounds.</p>
         <p>There is little in the record to mark any controlling distinction between the
            application of the gross load weight limitation to the motor truck and to the
            semi-trailer motor truck. There is testimony which is applicable to both types of
            vehicle, that in case of accident the danger from the momentum of a colliding vehicle
            increases with gross load weight. The record is without convincing evidence of the
            actual distribution, in practice, of the gross load weight over the wheels and axles of
            the permissible types of semi-trailer motor trucks, but this does not enable us to say
            that the legislature was without substantial ground for concluding that the relative
            advantages of a gross load over a wheel weight limitation are substantially the same for
            the two types, or that it could not have concluded that they were so nearly alike for
            regulatory purposes as to justify the adoption of a single standard for both, as a
            matter of practical convenience. Even if the legislature were to accept appellees'
            assumption that net load weights are, in practice, evenly distributed over the wheels
            supporting the load of a permissible semi-trailer so that with the statutory gross <span
               class="star-pagination">*195</span> load limit the load on the rear axle would be
            about 8,000 pounds it might, as we have seen, also conclude that the danger point would
            then have been reached in the case of some 1,200 miles of concrete state roads
            constructed without a center joint.</p>
         <p>These considerations, with the presumption of constitutionality, afford adequate support
            for the weight limitation without reference to other items of the testimony tending to
            support it. Furthermore, South Carolina's own experience is not to be ignored. Before
            adoption of the limitation South Carolina had had experience with higher weight limits.
            In 1924 it had adopted a combined gross weight limit of 20,000 pounds for vehicles of
            four wheels or less, and an axle weight limit of 15,000 pounds. In 1930 it had adopted a
            combined gross weight limit of 12 1/2 tons with a five ton axle weight limit for
            vehicles having more than two axles. Act No. 721, 33 Stat. 1182; Act No. 685, 36 Stat.
            1192, 1193. In 1931 it appointed a commission to investigate motor transportation in the
            state, to recommend legislation, and to report in 1932. The present weight limitation
            was recommended by the commission after a full consideration of relevant data, including
            a report by the state engineer who had constructed the concrete highways of the state
            and who advised a somewhat lower limitation as necessary for their preservation. The
            fact that many states have adopted a different standard is not persuasive. The
            conditions under which highways must be built in the several states, their construction
            and the demands made upon them, are not uniform. The road building art as the record
            shows, is far from having attained a scientific certainty and precision. and scientific
            precision is not the criterion for the exercise of the constitutional regulatory power
            of the states. Sproles v. Binford, supra, 388. The legislature, being free to exercise
            its own judgment, is not bound by that of other legislatures. It would hardly be
            contended <span class="star-pagination">*196</span> that if all the states had adopted a
            single standard none, in the light of its own experience and in the exercise of its
            judgment upon all the complex elements which enter into the problem, could change
            it.</p>
         <p>Only a word need be said as to the width limitation. While a large part of the highways
            in question are from 18 to 20 feet in width, approximately 100 miles are only 16 feet
            wide. On all the use of a 96 inch truck leaves but a narrow margin for passing. On the
            road 16 feet wide it leaves none. The 90 inch limitation has been in force in South
            Carolina since 1920 and the concrete highways which it has built appear to be adapted to
            vehicles of that width. The record shows without contradiction that the use of heavy
            loaded trucks on the highways tends to force other traffic off the concrete surface onto
            the shoulders of the road adjoining its edges and to increase repair costs materially.
            It appears also that as the width of trucks is increased it obstructs the view of the
            highway, causing much inconvenience and increased hazard in its use. It plainly cannot
            be said that the width of trucks used on the highways in South Carolina is unrelated to
            their safety and cost of maintenance, or that a 90 inch width limitation adopted to
            safeguard the highways of the State, is not within the range of the permissible
            legislative choice.</p>
         <p>The regulatory measures taken by South Carolina are within its legislative power. They
            do not infringe the Fourteenth Amendment, and the resulting burden on interstate
            commerce is not forbidden.</p>

         <p>Underlying the stated rule has been the thought, often expressed in judicial opinion,
            that when the regulation is of such a character that its burden falls principally upon
            those without the state, legislative action is not likely to be subjected to those
            political restraints which are normally exerted on legislation where it affects
            adversely some interests within the state. See Cooley v. Board of Port Wardens, <span
