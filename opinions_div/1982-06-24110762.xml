         <p>JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
         <p>The plaintiff in this lawsuit seeks relief in civil damages from a former President of
            the United States. The claim rests on actions allegedly taken in the former President's
            official capacity during his tenure in office. The issue before us is the scope of the
            immunity possessed by the President of the United States.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>In January 1970 the respondent A. Ernest Fitzgerald lost his job as a management analyst
            with the Department of the Air Force. Fitzgerald's dismissal occurred in the context of
            a departmental reorganization and reduction in force, in <span class="star-pagination"
               >*734</span> which his job was eliminated. In announcing the reorganization, the Air
            Force characterized the action as taken to promote economy and efficiency in the Armed
            Forces.</p>
         <p>Respondent's discharge attracted unusual attention in Congress and in the press.
            Fitzgerald had attained national prominence approximately one year earlier, during the
            waning months of the Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson. On November 13, 1968, Fitzgerald
            appeared before the Subcommittee on Economy in Government of the Joint Economic
            Committee of the United States Congress. To the evident embarrassment of his superiors
            in the Department of Defense, Fitzgerald testified that cost-overruns on the C-5A
            transport plane could approximate $2 billion.<span class="sup">[1]</span> He also
            revealed that unexpected technical difficulties had arisen during the development of the
            aircraft.</p>
         <p>Concerned that Fitzgerald might have suffered retaliation for his congressional
            testimony, the Subcommittee on Economy in Government convened public hearings on
            Fitzgerald's dismissal.<span class="sup">[2]</span> The press reported those hearings
            prominently, <span class="star-pagination">*735</span> as it had the earlier
            announcement that his job was being eliminated by the Department of Defense. At a news
            conference on December 8, 1969, President Richard Nixon was queried about Fitzgerald's
            impending separation from Government service.<span class="sup">[3]</span> The President
            responded by promising to look into the matter.<span class="sup">[4]</span> Shortly
            after the news conference the petitioner asked White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman
            to arrange for Fitzgerald's assignment to another job within the administration.<span
               class="sup">[5]</span> It also appears that the President suggested to Budget
            Director Robert Mayo that Fitzgerald might be offered a position in the Bureau of the
               Budget.<span class="sup">[6]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Fitzgerald's proposed reassignment encountered resistance within the
               administration.<span class="sup">[7]</span> In an internal memorandum of January 20,
            1970, White House aide Alexander Butterfield reported to Haldeman that " `Fitzgerald is
            no doubt a top-notch cost expert, but he must be given very low <span
               class="star-pagination">*736</span> marks in loyalty; and after all, loyalty is the
            name of the game.' "<span class="sup">[8]</span> Butterfield therefore recommended that
            " `[w]e should let him bleed, for a while at least.' "<span class="sup">[9]</span> There
            is no evidence of White House efforts to reemploy Fitzgerald subsequent to the
            Butterfield memorandum.</p>
         <p>Absent any offer of alternative federal employment, Fitzgerald complained to the Civil
            Service Commission. In a letter of January 20, 1970, he alleged that his separation
            represented unlawful retaliation for his truthful testimony before a congressional
               Committee.<span class="sup">[10]</span> The Commission convened a closed hearing on
            Fitzgerald's allegations on May 4, 1971. Fitzgerald, however, preferred to present his
            grievances in public. After he had brought suit and won an injunction, Fitzgerald v.
            Hampton, 152 U. S. App. D. C. 1, 467 F. 2d 755 (1972), public hearings commenced on
            January 26, 1973. The hearings again generated publicity, much of it devoted to the
            testimony of Air Force Secretary Robert Seamans. Although he denied that Fitzgerald had
            lost his position in retaliation for congressional testimony, Seamans testified that he
            had received "some advice" from the White House before <span class="star-pagination"
               >*737</span> Fitzgerald's job was abolished.<span class="sup">[11]</span> But the
            Secretary declined to be more specific. He responded to several questions by invoking
            "executive privilege."<span class="sup">[12]</span>
         </p>
         <p>At a news conference on January 31, 1973, the President was asked about Mr. Seamans'
            testimony. Mr. Nixon took the opportunity to assume personal responsibility for
            Fitzgerald's dismissal:</p> "I was totally aware that Mr. Fitzgerald would be fired or
         discharged or asked to resign. I approved it and Mr. Seamans must have been talking to
         someone who had discussed the matter with me. No, this was not a case of some person down
         the line deciding he should go. It was a decision that was submitted to me. I made it and I
         stick by it."<span class="sup">[13]</span>
         <p>A day later, however, the White House press office issued a retraction of the
            President's statement. According to a press spokesman, the President had confused
            Fitzgerald with another former executive employee. On behalf of the President, the
            spokesman asserted that Mr. Nixon had not had "put before him the decision regarding Mr.
               Fitzgerald."<span class="sup">[14]</span>
         </p>
         <p>After hearing over 4,000 pages of testimony, the Chief Examiner for the Civil Service
            Commission issued his decision <span class="star-pagination">*738</span> in the
            Fitzgerald case on September 18, 1973. Decision on the Appeal of A. Ernest Fitzgerald,
            as reprinted in App. 60a. The Examiner held that Fitzgerald's dismissal had offended
            applicable civil service regulations. Id., at 86a-87a.<span class="sup">[15]</span> The
            Examiner based this conclusion on a finding that the departmental reorganization in
            which Fitzgerald lost his job, though purportedly implemented as an economy measure, was
            in fact motivated by "reasons purely personal to" respondent. Id., at 86a. As this was
            an impermissible basis for a reduction in force,<span class="sup">[16]</span> the
            Examiner recommended Fitzgerald's reappointment to his old position or to a job of
            comparable authority.<span class="sup">[17]</span>
            <span class="star-pagination">*739</span> The Examiner, however, explicitly
            distinguished this narrow conclusion from a suggested finding that Fitzgerald had
            suffered retaliation for his testimony to Congress. As found by the Commission, "the
            evidence of record does not support [Fitzgerald's] allegation that his position was
            abolished and that he was separated . . . in retaliation for his having revealed the
            C-5A cost overrun in testimony before the Proxmire Committee on November 13, 1968." Id.,
            at 81a.</p>
         <p>Following the Commission's decision, Fitzgerald filed a suit for damages in the United
            States District Court. In it he raised essentially the same claims presented to the
            Civil Service Commission.<span class="sup">[18]</span> As defendants he named eight
            officials of the Defense Department, White House aide Alexander Butterfield, and "one or
            More" unnamed "White House Aides" styled only as "John Does."</p>
         <p>The District Court dismissed the action under the District of Columbia's 3-year statute
            of limitations, Fitzgerald v. Seamans, <span class="citation">

            </span> (DC 1974), and the Court of Appeals affirmed as to all but one defendant, White
            House aide Alexander Butterfield, Fitzgerald v. Seamans, 180 U. S. App. D. C. 75, 553 F.
            2d 220 (1977). The Court of Appeals reasoned that Fitzgerald had no reason to suspect
            White House involvement in his dismissal at least until 1973. In that year, reasonable
            grounds for suspicion had arisen, most notably through publication of the internal White
            House memorandum in which Butterfield had recommended that Fitzgerald at least should be
            made to "bleed for a while" before being offered another job in the administration. Id.,
            at 80, 84, 553 F. 2d, at 225, 229. Holding that concealment of illegal activity <span
               class="star-pagination">*740</span> would toll the statute of limitations, the Court
            of Appeals remanded the action against Butterfield for further proceedings in the
            District Court.</p>
         <p>Following the remand and extensive discovery thereafter, Fitzgerald filed a second
            amended complaint in the District Court on July 5, 1978. It was in this amended
            complaint &#x97; more than eight years after he had complained of his discharge to the
            Civil Service Commission &#x97; that Fitzgerald first named the petitioner Nixon as a
            party defendant.<span class="sup">[19]</span> Also included as defendants were White
            House aide Bryce Harlow and other officials of the Nixon administration. Additional
            discovery ensued. By March 1980, only three defendants remained: the petitioner Richard
            Nixon and White House aides Harlow and Butterfield. Denying a motion for summary
            judgment, the District Court ruled that the action must proceed to trial. Its order of
            March 26 held that Fitzgerald had stated triable causes of action under two federal
            statutes and the First Amendment to the Constitution.<span class="sup">[20]</span> The
            court also <span class="star-pagination">*741</span> ruled that petitioner was not
            entitled to claim absolute Presidential immunity.</p>
         <p>Petitioner took a collateral appeal of the immunity decision to the Court of Appeals for
            the District of Columbia Circuit. The Court of Appeals dismissed summarily. It
            apparently did so on the ground that its recent decision in Halperin v. Kissinger, 196
            U. S. App. D. C. 285, 606 F. 2d 1192 (1979), aff'd in pertinent part by an equally
            divided Court, 452 U. S. 713 (1981), had rejected this claimed immunity defense.</p>
         <p>As this Court has not ruled on the scope of immunity available to a President of the
            United States, we granted certiorari to decide this important issue. 452 U. S. 959
            (1981).</p>

         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>Before addressing the merits of this case, we must consider two challenges to our
            jurisdiction. In his opposition to the petition for certiorari, respondent argued that
            this Court is without jurisdiction to review the nonfinal order in which the District
            Court rejected petitioner's claim to absolute immunity.<span class="sup">[21]</span> We
            also must consider an argument that an agreement between the parties has mooted the
            controversy.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>Petitioner invokes the jurisdiction of this Court under 28 U. S. C. § 1254, a statute
            that invests us with authority to review "[c]ases in" the courts of appeals.<span
               class="sup">[22]</span> When the petitioner <span class="star-pagination">*742</span>
            in this case sought review of an interlocutory order denying his claim to absolute
            immunity, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
            Emphasizing the "jurisdictional" basis for the Court of Appeals' decision, respondent
            argued that the District Court's order was not an appealable "case" properly "in" the
            Court of Appeals within the meaning of § 1254. We do not agree.</p>
         <p>Under the "collateral order" doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337
            U. S. 541 (1949), a small class of interlocutory orders are immediately appealable to
            the courts of appeals. As defined by Cohen, this class embraces orders that
            "conclusively determine the disputed question, resolve an important issue completely
            separate from the merits of the action, and [are] effectively unreviewable on appeal
            from a final judgment." Coopers &amp;amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 468 (1978);
            see Cohen, supra, at 546-547. As an additional requirement, Cohen established that a
            collateral appeal of an interlocutory order must "presen[t] a serious and unsettled
            question." 337 U. S., at 547. At least twice before this Court has held that orders
            denying claims of absolute immunity are appealable under the Cohen criteria. See
            Helstoski v. Meanor, 442 U. S. 500 (1979) (claim of immunity under the Speech and Debate
            Clause); Abney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651 (1977) (claim of immunity under Double
            Jeopardy Clause). In previous cases the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
            Circuit also has treated orders denying absolute immunity as appealable under Cohen. See
            Briggs v. Goodwin, 186 U. S. App. D. C. 179, 227-229, 569 F. 2d 10, 58-60 (1977)
            (Wilkey, J., dissenting on the appealability issue); McSurely v. McClellan, 172 U. S.
            App. D. C. 364, 372, 521 F. 2d 1024, 1032 (1975), aff'd in pertinent part en banc, 180
            U. S. App. D. C. 101, 107-108, n. 18, 553 F. 2d 1277, 1283-1284, n. 18 (1976), cert.
            dism'd sub nom. McAdams v. McSurely, 438 U. S. 189 (1978).</p>
         <p>In "dismissing" the appeal in this case, the Court of Appeals appears to have reasoned
            that petitioner's appeal lay <span class="star-pagination">*743</span> outside the Cohen
            doctrine because it raised no "serious and unsettled question" of law. This argument was
            pressed by the respondent, who asked the Court of Appeals to dismiss on the basis of
            that court's "controlling" decision in Halperin v. Kissinger, supra.</p>
         <p>Under the circumstances of this case, we cannot agree that petitioner's interlocutory
            appeal failed to raise a "serious and unsettled" question. Although the Court of Appeals
            had ruled in Halperin v. Kissinger that the President was not entitled to absolute
            immunity, this Court never had so held. And a petition for certiorari in Halperin was
            pending in this Court at the time petitioner's appeal was dismissed. In light of the
            special solicitude due to claims alleging a threatened breach of essential Presidential
            prerogatives under the separation of powers, see United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683,
            691-692 (1974), we conclude that petitioner did present a "serious and unsettled" and
            therefore appealable question to the Court of Appeals. It follows that the case was "in"
            the Court of Appeals under § 1254 and properly within our certiorari jurisdiction.<span
               class="sup">[23]</span>
         </p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B</h2>
         <p>Shortly after petitioner had filed his petition for certiorari in this Court and
            respondent had entered his opposition, the parties reached an agreement to liquidate
               damages.<span class="sup">[24]</span> Under <span class="star-pagination">*744</span>
            its terms the petitioner Nixon paid the respondent Fitzgerald a sum of $142,000. In
            consideration, Fitzgerald agreed to accept liquidated damages of $28,000 in the event of
            a ruling by this Court that petitioner was not entitled to absolute immunity. In case of
            a decision upholding petitioner's immunity claim, no further payments would be made.</p>
         <p>The limited agreement between the parties left both petitioner and respondent with a
            considerable financial stake in the resolution of the question presented in this Court.
            As we recently concluded in a case involving a similar contract: "Given respondents'
            continued active pursuit of monetary relief, this case remains `definite and concrete,
            touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests.' " Havens Realty
            Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U. S. 363, 371 (1982), quoting Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300
            U. S. 227, 240-241 (1937).</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>This Court consistently has recognized that government officials are entitled to some
            form of immunity from suits for civil damages. In Spalding v. Vilas, 161 U. S. 483
            (1896), the Court considered the immunity available to the Postmaster General in a suit
            for damages based upon his official acts. Drawing upon principles of immunity developed
            in English cases at common law, the Court concluded that "[t]he interests of the people"
            required a grant of absolute immunity to public officers. Id., at 498. In the absence of
            immunity, the Court reasoned, executive officials would hesitate to exercise <span
               class="star-pagination">*745</span> their discretion in a way "injuriously
            affect[ing] the claims of particular individuals," id., at 499, even when the public
            interest required bold and unhesitating action. Considerations of "public policy and
            convenience" therefore compelled a judicial recognition of immunity from suits arising
            from official acts.</p> "In exercising the functions of his office, the head of an
         Executive Department, keeping within the limits of his authority, should not be under an
         apprehension that the motives that control his official conduct may, at any time, become
         the subject of inquiry in a civil suit for damages. It would seriously cripple the proper
         and effective administration of public affairs as entrusted to the executive branch of the
         government, if he were subjected to any such restraint." Id., at 498. <p>Decisions
            subsequent to Spalding have extended the defense of immunity to actions besides those at
            common law. In Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U. S. 367 (1951), the Court considered whether
            the passage of 42 U. S. C. § 1983, which made no express provision for immunity for any
            official, had abrogated the privilege accorded to state legislators at common law.
            Tenney held that it had not. Examining § 1983 in light of the "presuppositions of our
            political history" and our heritage of legislative freedom, the Court found it
            incredible "that Congress . . . would impinge on a tradition so well grounded in history
            and reason" without some indication of intent more explicit than the general language of
            the statute. Id., at 376. Similarly, the decision in Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547
            (1967), involving a § 1983 suit against a state judge, recognized the continued validity
            of the absolute immunity of judges for acts within the judicial role. This was a
            doctrine " `not for the protection or benefit of a malicious or corrupt judge, but for
            the benefit of the public, whose interest it is that the judges should be at liberty to
            exercise their functions <span class="star-pagination">*746</span> with independence and
            without fear of consequences.' " Id., at 554, quoting Scott v. Stansfield, L. R. 3 Ex.
            220, 223 (1868). See Bradley v. Fisher, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/sij/bradley-v-fisher/">
                  <span class="volume">13</span>
                  <span class="reporter">Wall.</span>
                  <span class="page">335</span>
               </a>
            </span> (1872). The Court in Pierson also held that police officers are entitled to a
            qualified immunity protecting them from suit when their official acts are performed in
            "good faith." 386 U. S., at 557.</p>
         <p>In Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232 (1974), the Court considered the immunity available
            to state executive officials in a § 1983 suit alleging the violation of constitutional
            rights. In that case we rejected the officials' claim to absolute immunity under the
            doctrine of Spalding v. Vilas, finding instead that state executive officials possessed
            a "good faith" immunity from § 1983 suits alleging constitutional violations. Balancing
            the purposes of § 1983 against the imperatives of public policy, the Court held that "in
            varying scope, a qualified immunity is available to officers of the executive branch of
            government, the variation being dependent upon the scope of discretion and
            responsibilities of the office and all the circumstances as they reasonably appeared at
            the time of the action on which liability is sought to be based." 416 U. S., at 247.</p>
         <p>As construed by subsequent cases, Scheuer established a two-tiered division of immunity
            defenses in § 1983 suits. To most executive officers Scheuer accorded qualified
            immunity. For them the scope of the defense varied in proportion to the nature of their
            official functions and the range of decisions that conceivably might be taken in "good
            faith." This "functional" approach also defined a second tier, however, at which the
            especially sensitive duties of certain officials &#x97; notably judges and prosecutors
            &#x97; required the continued recognition of absolute immunity. See, e. g., Imbler v.
            Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409 (1976) (state prosecutors possess absolute immunity with respect
            to the initiation and pursuit of prosecutions); Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U. S. 349 (1978)
            (state judge possesses absolute immunity for all judicial acts).</p>
         <p>This approach was reviewed in detail in Butz v. Economou, <span class="star-pagination"
               >*747</span> 438 U. S. 478 (1978), when we considered for the first time the kind of
            immunity possessed by federal executive officials who are sued for constitutional
               violations.<span class="sup">[25]</span> In Butz the Court rejected an argument,
            based on decisions involving federal officials charged with common-law torts, that all
            high federal officials have a right to absolute immunity from constitutional damages
            actions. Concluding that a blanket recognition of absolute immunity would be anomalous
            in light of the qualified immunity standard applied to state executive officials, id.,
            at 504, we held that federal officials generally have the same qualified immunity
            possessed by state officials in cases under § 1983. In so doing we reaffirmed our
            holdings that some officials, notably judges and prosecutors, "because of the special
            nature of their responsibilities," id., at 511, "require a full exemption from
            liability." Id., at 508. In Butz itself we upheld a claim of absolute immunity for
            administrative officials engaged in functions analogous to those of judges and
            prosecutors. Ibid. We also left open the question whether other federal officials could
            show that "public policy requires an exemption of that scope." Id., at 506.</p>

         <h2>B</h2>
         <p>Our decisions concerning the immunity of government officials from civil damages
            liability have been guided by the Constitution, federal statutes, and history.
            Additionally, at least in the absence of explicit constitutional or congressional
            guidance, our immunity decisions have been informed by the common law. See Butz v.
            Economou, supra, at 508; Imbler v. Pachtman, supra, at 421. This Court necessarily also
            has weighed concerns of public policy, especially as illuminated <span
               class="star-pagination">*748</span> by our history and the structure of our
            government. See, e. g., Butz v. Economou, supra, at 508; Imbler v. Pachtman, supra, at
            421; Spalding v. Vilas, 161 U. S., at 498.<span class="sup">[26]</span>
         </p>
         <p>This case now presents the claim that the President of the United States is shielded by
            absolute immunity from civil damages liability. In the case of the President the
            inquiries into history and policy, though mandated independently by our cases, tend to
            converge. Because the Presidency did not exist through most of the development of common
            law, any historical analysis must draw its evidence primarily from our constitutional
            heritage and structure. Historical inquiry thus merges almost at its inception with the
            kind of "public policy" analysis appropriately undertaken by a federal court. This
            inquiry involves policies and principles that may be considered implicit in the nature
            of the President's office in a system structured to achieve effective government under a
            constitutionally mandated separation of powers.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>IV</h2>
         <p>Here a former President asserts his immunity from civil damages claims of two kinds. He
            stands named as a defendant in a direct action under the Constitution and in two
            statutory actions under federal laws of general applicability. In neither case has
            Congress taken express legislative action to subject the President to civil liability
            for his official acts.<span class="sup">[27]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*749</span> Applying the principles of our cases to claims
            of this kind, we hold that petitioner, as a former President of the United States, is
            entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability predicated on his official acts. We
            consider this immunity a functionally mandated incident of the President's unique
            office, rooted in the constitutional tradition of the separation of powers and supported
            by our history. Justice Story's analysis remains persuasive:</p> "There are . . .
         incidental powers, belonging to the executive department, which are necessarily implied
         from the nature of the functions, which are confided to it. Among these, must necessarily
         be included the power to perform them . . . . The president cannot, therefore, be liable to
         arrest, imprisonment, or detention, while he is in the discharge of the duties of his
         office; and for this purpose his person must be deemed, in civil cases at least, to possess
         an official inviolability." 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United
         States § 1563, pp. 418-419 (1st ed. 1833). <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>The President occupies a unique position in the constitutional scheme. Article II, § 1,
            of the Constitution provides that "[t]he executive Power shall be vested in a President
            of <span class="star-pagination">*750</span> the United States . . . ." This grant of
            authority establishes the President as the chief constitutional officer of the Executive
            Branch, entrusted with supervisory and policy responsibilities of utmost discretion and
            sensitivity. These include the enforcement of federal law &#x97; it is the President who
            is charged constitutionally to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed";<span
               class="sup">[28]</span> the conduct of foreign affairs &#x97; a realm in which the
            Court has recognized that "[i]t would be intolerable that courts, without the relevant
            information, should review and perhaps nullify actions of the Executive taken on
            information properly held secret";<span class="sup">[29]</span> and management of the
            Executive Branch &#x97; a task for which "imperative reasons requir[e] an unrestricted
            power [in the President] to remove the most important of his subordinates in their most
            important duties."<span class="sup">[30]</span>
         </p>
         <p>In arguing that the President is entitled only to qualified immunity, the respondent
            relies on cases in which we have recognized immunity of this scope for governors and
            cabinet officers. E. g., Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478 (1978); Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416
            U. S. 232 (1974). We find these cases to be inapposite. The President's unique status
            under the Constitution distinguishes him from other executive officials.<span
               class="sup">[31]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*751</span> Because of the singular importance of the
            President's duties, diversion of his energies by concern with private lawsuits would
            raise unique risks to the effective functioning of government. As is the case with
            prosecutors and judges &#x97; <span class="star-pagination">*752</span> for whom
            absolute immunity now is established &#x97; a President must concern himself with
            matters likely to "arouse the most intense feelings." Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S., at 554.
            Yet, as our decisions have recognized, it is in precisely such cases that there exists
            the greatest public interest in providing an official "the maximum ability to deal
            fearlessly and impartially with" the duties of his office. Ferri v. Ackerman, 444 U. S.
            193, 203 (1979). This concern is compelling where the officeholder must make the most
            sensitive and far-reaching decisions entrusted to any official under our constitutional
               system.<span class="sup">[32]</span> Nor can the sheer prominence of the President's
               <span class="star-pagination">*753</span> office be ignored. In view of the
            visibility of his office and the effect of his actions on countless people, the
            President would be an easily identifiable target for suits for civil damages.<span
               class="sup">[33]</span> Cognizance of this personal vulnerability frequently could
            distract a President from his public duties, to the detriment of not only the President
            and his office but also the Nation that the Presidency was designed to serve.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B</h2>
         <p>Courts traditionally have recognized the President's constitutional responsibilities and
            status as factors counseling judicial deference and restraint.<span class="sup"
               >[34]</span> For example, while courts generally have looked to the common law to
            determine the scope of an official's evidentiary privilege,<span class="sup">[35]</span>
            we have recognized that the Presidential privilege is "rooted in the separation of
            powers under the Constitution." United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S., at 708. It is settled
            law that the separation-of-powers doctrine does not bar every exercise of jurisdiction
               <span class="star-pagination">*754</span> over the President of the United States.
            See, e. g., United States v. Nixon, supra; United States v. Burr, <span class="citation">

            Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579 (1952).<span class="sup">[36]</span> But our cases also have
            established that a court, before exercising jurisdiction, must balance the
            constitutional weight of the interest to be served against the dangers of intrusion on
            the authority and functions of the Executive Branch. See Nixon v. Administrator of
            General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 443 (1977); United States v. Nixon, supra, at 703-713.
            When judicial action is needed to serve broad public interests &#x97; as when the Court
            acts, not in derogation of the separation of powers, but to maintain their proper
            balance, cf. Youngstown Sheet &amp;amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, supra, or to vindicate the
            public interest in an ongoing criminal prosecution, see United States v. Nixon, supra
            &#x97; the exercise of jurisdiction has been held warranted. In the case of this merely
            private suit for damages based on a President's official acts, we hold it is not.<span
               class="sup">[37]</span>
         </p>
         <p/>
         <h2>
            <span class="star-pagination">*755</span> C</h2>
         <p>In defining the scope of an official's absolute privilege, this Court has recognized
            that the sphere of protected action must be related closely to the immunity's justifying
            purposes. Frequently our decisions have held that an official's absolute immunity should
            extend only to acts in performance of particular functions of his office. See Butz v.
            Economou, 438 U. S., at 508-517; cf. Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S., at 430-431. But the
            Court also has refused to draw functional lines finer than history and reason would
            support. See, e. g., Spalding v. Vilas, 161 U. S., at 498 (privilege extends to all
            matters "committed by law to [an official's] control or supervision"); Barr v. Matteo,
            360 U. S. 564, 575 (1959) (fact "that the action here taken was within the outer
            perimeter of petitioner's line of duty is enough to render the privilege applicable
               <span class="star-pagination">*756</span>. . ."); Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U. S., at
            363, and n. 12 (judicial privilege applies even to acts occurring outside "the normal
            attributes of a judicial proceeding"). In view of the special nature of the President's
            constitutional office and functions, we think it appropriate to recognize absolute
            Presidential immunity from damages liability for acts within the "outer perimeter" of
            his official responsibility.</p>
         <p>Under the Constitution and laws of the United States the President has discretionary
            responsibilities in a broad variety of areas, many of them highly sensitive. In many
            cases it would be difficult to determine which of the President's innumerable
            "functions" encompassed a particular action. In this case, for example, respondent
            argues that he was dismissed in retaliation for his testimony to Congress &#x97; a
            violation of 5 U. S. C. § 7211 (1976 ed., Supp. IV) and 18 U. S. C. § 1505. The Air
            Force, however, has claimed that the underlying reorganization was undertaken to promote
            efficiency. Assuming that petitioner Nixon ordered the reorganization in which
            respondent lost his job, an inquiry into the President's motives could not be avoided
            under the kind of "functional" theory asserted both by respondent and the dissent.
            Inquiries of this kind could be highly intrusive.</p>
         <p>Here respondent argues that petitioner Nixon would have acted outside the outer
            perimeter of his duties by ordering the discharge of an employee who was lawfully
            entitled to retain his job in the absence of " `such cause as will promote the
            efficiency of the service.' " Brief for Respondent 39, citing 5 U. S. C. § 7512(a).
            Because Congress has granted this legislative protection, respondent argues, no federal
            official could, within the outer perimeter of his duties of office, cause Fitzgerald to
            be dismissed without satisfying this standard in prescribed statutory proceedings.</p>
         <p>This construction would subject the President to trial on virtually every allegation
            that an action was unlawful, or was taken for a forbidden purpose. Adoption of this
            construction thus would deprive absolute immunity of its intended effect. <span
               class="star-pagination">*757</span> It clearly is within the President's
            constitutional and statutory authority to prescribe the manner in which the Secretary
            will conduct the business of the Air Force. See 10 U. S. C. § 8012(b). Because this
            mandate of office must include the authority to prescribe reorganizations and reductions
            in force, we conclude that petitioner's alleged wrongful acts lay well within the outer
            perimeter of his authority.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>V</h2>
         <p>A rule of absolute immunity for the President will not leave the Nation without
            sufficient protection against misconduct on the part of the Chief Executive.<span
               class="sup">[38]</span> There remains the constitutional remedy of impeachment.<span
               class="sup">[39]</span> In addition, there are formal and informal checks on
            Presidential action that do not apply with equal force to other executive officials. The
            President is subjected to constant scrutiny by the press. Vigilant oversight by Congress
            also may serve to deter Presidential abuses of office, as well as to make credible the
            threat of impeachment.<span class="sup">[40]</span> Other incentives to avoid misconduct
            may include a desire to earn reelection, the need to maintain prestige as an element of
            Presidential influence, and a President's traditional concern for his historical
            stature.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*758</span> The existence of alternative remedies and
            deterrents establishes that absolute immunity will not place the President "above the
               law."<span class="sup">[41]</span> For the President, as for judges and prosecutors,
            absolute immunity merely precludes a particular private remedy for alleged misconduct in
            order to advance compelling public ends.</p>

         <h2>VI</h2>
         <p>For the reasons stated in this opinion, the decision of the Court of Appeals is

         <p>CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, concurring.</p>
         <p>I join the Court's opinion, but I write separately to underscore that the President
            immunity derives from and is mandated by the constitutional doctrine of separation of
            powers. Indeed, it has been taken for granted for nearly two centuries.<span class="sup"
               >[1]</span> In reaching this conclusion we do well to bear in mind that the focus

            individual conduct in a fact-bound setting; rather, in those familiar terms of John
            Marshall, it is a Constitution we are expounding. Constitutional adjudication often
            bears unpalatable fruit. But the needs of a system of government sometimes must outweigh
            the right of individuals to collect damages.</p>
         <p>It strains the meaning of the words used to say this places a President "above the law."
            United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683 (1974). The dissents are wide of the mark to the
            extent that they imply that the Court today recognizes sweeping immunity for a President
            for all acts. The Court does no such thing. The immunity is limited to civil damages
            claims. Moreover, a President, like Members of Congress, judges, prosecutors, or
            congressional aides &#x97; all having absolute immunity &#x97; are not immune for acts
            outside official duties.<span class="sup">[2]</span>Ante, at 753-755. Even the broad

            <span class="star-pagination">*760</span> In his dissenting opinion, JUSTICE WHITE
            confuses "judicial process" in the subpoena sense with a civil damages suit. Post, at
            778, n. 23. He quotes language from United States v. Nixon, supra, at 706, as though
            that language has some relevance to the matter of immunity from civil damages:</p>
         "[N]either the doctrine of separation of powers, nor the need for confidentiality . . .
         without more, can sustain an absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from
         judicial process under all circumstances." Post, at 782. (Emphasis added.) <p>First, it is
            important to remember that the context of that language is a criminal prosecution.
            Second, the "judicial process" referred to was, as in United States v. Burr, <span

            Justice), a subpoena to the President to produce relevant evidence in a criminal
            prosecution. No issue of damages immunity was involved either in Burr or United States
            v. Nixon. In short, the quoted language has no bearing whatever on a civil action for
            damages. It is one thing to say that a President must produce evidence relevant to a
            criminal case, as in Burr and United States v. Nixon, and quite another to say a
            President can be held for civil damages for dismissing a federal employee. If the
            dismissal is wrongful the employee can be reinstated with backpay, as was done here. See
            n. 5, infra.</p>
         <p>The immunity of a President from civil suits is not simply a doctrine derived from this
            Court's interpretation of common law or public policy. Absolute immunity for a President
            for acts within the official duties of the Chief Executive is either to be found in the
            constitutional separation of powers or it does not exist. The Court today holds that the
            Constitution mandates such immunity and I agree.</p>
         <p>The essential purpose of the separation of powers is to allow for independent
            functioning of each coequal branch of <span class="star-pagination">*761</span>
            government within its assigned sphere of responsibility, free from risk of control,
            interference, or intimidation by other branches. United States v. Nixon, supra; Gravel
            v. United States, 408 U. S. 606, 617 (1972). Even prior to the adoption of our
            Constitution, as well as after, judicial review of legislative action was recognized in
            some instances as necessary to maintain the proper checks and balances. Den on the Dem.

            always must be hesitant to probe into the elements of Presidential decisionmaking, just
            as other branches should be hesitant to probe into judicial decisionmaking. Such
            judicial intervention is not to be tolerated absent imperative constitutional necessity.
            United States v. Nixon, supra, at 709-716.<span class="sup">[4]</span> The Court's
            opinion correctly observes that judicial intrusion through private damages actions
            improperly impinges on and hence interferes with the independence that is imperative to
            the functioning of the office of a President.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*762</span> Exposing a President to civil damages actions
            for official acts within the scope of the Executive authority would inevitably subject
            Presidential actions to undue judicial scrutiny as well as subject the President to
            harassment. The enormous range and impact of Presidential decisions &#x97; far beyond
            that of any one Member of Congress &#x97; inescapably means that many persons will
            consider themselves aggrieved by such acts. Absent absolute immunity, every person who
            feels aggrieved would be free to bring a suit for damages, and each suit &#x97;
            especially those that proceed on the merits &#x97; would involve some judicial
            questioning of Presidential acts, including the reasons for the decision, how it was
            arrived at, the information on which it was based, and who supplied the information.
            Such scrutiny of day-to-day decisions of the Executive Branch would be bound to occur if
            civil damages actions were made available to private individuals. Although the
            individual who claims wrongful conduct may indeed have sustained some injury, the need
            to prevent large-scale invasion of the Executive function by the Judiciary far outweighs
            the need to vindicate the private claims. We have decided that in a similar sense
            Members of both Houses of Congress &#x97; and their aides &#x97; must be totally free
            from judicial scrutiny for legislative acts; the public interest, in other words,
            outweighs the need for private redress of one claiming injury from legislative acts of a
            Member or aide of a Member.<span class="sup">[5]</span> The Court's concern (and the
            even more emphatic concerns <span class="star-pagination">*763</span> expressed by
            JUSTICE WHITE'S dissent) over "unremedied wrongs" to citizens by a President seem odd
            when one compares the potential for "wrongs" which thousands of congressional aides,
            prosecutors, and judges can theoretically inflict &#x97; with absolute immunity &#x97;
            on the same citizens for whom this concern is expressed. See n. 2, supra.</p>
         <p>Judicial intervention would also inevitably inhibit the processes of Executive Branch
            decisionmaking and impede the functioning of the Office of the President. The need to
            defend damages suits would have the serious effect of diverting the attention of a
            President from his executive duties since defending a lawsuit today &#x97; even a
            lawsuit ultimately found to be frivolous &#x97; often requires significant expenditures
            of time and money, as many former public officials have learned to their sorrow. This
            very case graphically illustrates the point. When litigation processes are not tightly
            controlled &#x97; and often they are not &#x97; they can be and are used as mechanisms
            of extortion. Ultimate vindication on the merits does not repair the damage.<span
               class="sup">[6]</span>
         </p>
         <p>I fully agree that the constitutional concept of separation of independent coequal
            powers dictates that a President be immune from civil damages actions based on acts
            within the scope of Executive authority while in office.<span class="sup">[7]</span> Far
            from placing <span class="star-pagination">*764A</span> a President above the law, the
            Court's holding places a President on essentially the same footing with judges and other
            officials whose absolute immunity we have recognized.</p></div>
      <div type="dissent" judge="white">
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*764B</span> JUSTICE WHITE, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN,
            JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE BLACKMUN join, dissenting.</p>
         <p>The four dissenting Members of the Court in Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478 (1978),
            argued that all federal officials are entitled to absolute immunity from suit for any
            action they take in connection with their official duties. That immunity would extend
            even to actions taken with express knowledge that the conduct was clearly contrary to
            the controlling statute or clearly violative of the Constitution. Fortunately, the
            majority of the Court rejected that approach: We held that although public officials
            perform certain functions that entitle them to absolute immunity, the immunity attaches
            to particular functions &#x97; not to particular offices. Officials performing functions
            for which immunity is not absolute enjoy qualified immunity; they are liable in damages
            only if their conduct violated well-established law and if they should have realized
            that their conduct was illegal.</p>
         <p>The Court now applies the dissenting view in Butz to the Office of the President: A
            President, acting within the outer boundaries of what Presidents normally do, may,
            without liability, deliberately cause serious injury to any number of citizens even
            though he knows his conduct violates a statute or tramples on the constitutional rights
            of those who are injured. Even if the President in this case ordered Fitzgerald fired by
            means of a trumped-up reduction in force, knowing that such a discharge was contrary to
            the civil service laws, he would be absolutely immune from suit. By the same token, if a
            President, without following the statutory procedures which he knows apply to himself as
            well as to other federal <span class="star-pagination">*765</span> officials, orders his
            subordinates to wiretap or break into a home for the purpose of installing a listening
            device, and the officers comply with his request, the President would be absolutely
            immune from suit. He would be immune regardless of the damage he inflicts, regardless of
            how violative of the statute and of the Constitution he knew his conduct to be, and
            regardless of his purpose.<span class="sup">[1]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The Court intimates that its decision is grounded in the Constitution. If that is the
            case, Congress cannot provide a remedy against Presidential misconduct and the criminal
            laws of the United States are wholly inapplicable to the President. I find this approach
            completely unacceptable. I do not agree that if the Office of President is to operate
            effectively, the holder of that Office must be permitted, without fear of liability and
            regardless of the function he is performing, deliberately to inflict injury on others by
            conduct that he knows violates the law.</p>
         <p>We have not taken such a scatter-gun approach in other cases. Butz held that absolute
            immunity did not attach to the office held by a member of the President's Cabinet but
            only to those specific functions performed by that officer for which absolute immunity
            is clearly essential. Members of Congress are absolutely immune under the Speech or
            Debate Clause of the Constitution, but the immunity extends only to their legislative
            acts. We have never held that in order for legislative work to be done, it is necessary
            to immunize all of the tasks that legislators must perform. Constitutional immunity does
            not extend to those many things that Senators and Representatives regularly and
            necessarily do that are not legislative acts. Members of Congress, for example,
            repeatedly importune the executive branch and administrative agencies outside hearing
            rooms and legislative halls, but they are not immune if in connection with such activity
            they deliberately <span class="star-pagination">*766</span> violate the law. United
            States v. Brewster, 408 U. S. 501 (1972), for example, makes this clear. Neither is a
            Member of Congress or his aide immune from damages suits if in order to secure
            information deemed relevant to a legislative investigation, he breaks into a house and
            carries away records. Gravel v. United States, 408 U. S. 606 (1972). Judges are
            absolutely immune from liability for damages, but only when performing a judicial
            function, and even then they are subject to criminal liability. See Dennis v. Sparks,
            449 U. S. 24, 31 (1980); O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S. 488, 503 (1974). The absolute
            immunity of prosecutors is likewise limited to the prosecutorial function. A prosecutor
            who directs that an investigation be carried out in a way that is patently illegal is
            not immune.</p>
         <p>In Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 165 (1803), the Court, speaking through The Chief
            Justice, observed that while there were "important political powers" committed to the
            President for the performance of which neither he nor his appointees were accountable in
            court, "the question, whether the legality of an act of the head of a department be
            examinable in a court of justice or not, must always depend on the nature of that act."
            The Court nevertheless refuses to follow this course with respect to the President. It
            makes no effort to distinguish categories of Presidential conduct that should be
            absolutely immune from other categories of conduct that should not qualify for that
            level of immunity. The Court instead concludes that whatever the President does and
            however contrary to law he knows his conduct to be, he may, without fear of liability,
            injure federal employees or any other person within or without the Government.</p>
         <p>Attaching absolute immunity to the Office of the President, rather than to particular
            activities that the President might perform, places the President above the law. It is a
            reversion to the old notion that the King can do no wrong. Until now, this concept had
            survived in this country only in the form of sovereign immunity. That doctrine
            forecloses suit against the Government itself and against Government officials, <span
               class="star-pagination">*767</span> but only when the suit against the latter
            actually seeks relief against the sovereign. Larson v. Domestic &amp;amp; Foreign
            Commerce Corp., 337 U. S. 682, 687 (1949). Suit against an officer, however, may be
            maintained where it seeks specific relief against him for conduct contrary to his
            statutory authority or to the Constitution. Id., at 698. Now, however, the Court clothes
            the Office of the President with sovereign immunity, placing it beyond the law.<span
               class="sup">[2]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*768</span> In Marbury v. Madison, supra, at 163, The
            Chief Justice, speaking for the Court, observed: "The Government of the United States
            has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men. It will certainly
            cease to deserve this high appellation, if the laws furnish no remedy for the violation
            of a vested legal right." Until now, the Court has consistently adhered to this
            proposition. In Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232 (1974), a unanimous Court held that the
            Governor of a State was entitled only to a qualified immunity. We reached this position,
            even though we recognized that</p> "[i]n the case of higher officers of the executive
         branch. . . the inquiry is far more complex since the range of decisions and choices &#x97;
         whether the formulation of policy, of legislation, of budgets, or of day-to-day decisions
         &#x97; is virtually infinite. . . . In short, since the options which a chief executive and
         his principal subordinates must consider are far broader and far more subtle than those
         made by officials with less responsibility, the range of discretion must be comparably
         broad." Id., at 246-247. <p>As JUSTICE BRENNAN observed in McGautha v. California, 402 U.
            S. 183, 252-253 (1971) (dissenting opinion): "The principle that our Government shall be
            of laws and not of men is so strongly woven into our constitutional fabric that it has
            found recognition in not just one but several provisions of the Constitution" (footnote
            omitted). And as THE CHIEF JUSTICE said in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Reis, 451 U.
            S. 401, 429 (1981) (dissenting opinion):</p> "Accountability of each individual for
         individual conduct lies at the core of all law &#x97; indeed, of all organized societies.
         The trend to eliminate or modify sovereign immunity is not an unrelated development; we
         have moved away from `The King can do no wrong.' This <span class="star-pagination"
            >*769</span> principle of individual accountability is fundamental if the structure of
         an organized society is not to be eroded to anarchy and impotence, and it remains essential
         in civil as well as criminal justice." <p>Unfortunately, the Court now abandons basic
            principles that have been powerful guides to decision. It is particularly unfortunate
            since the judgment in this case has few, if any, indicia of a judicial decision; it is
            almost wholly a policy choice, a choice that is without substantial support and that in
            all events is ambiguous in its reach and import.</p>
         <p>We have previously stated that "the law of privilege as a defense to damages actions
            against officers of Government has `in large part been of judicial making.' " Butz v.
            Economou, 438 U. S., at 501-502, quoting Barr v. Matteo, 360 U. S. 564, 569 (1959). But
            this does not mean that the Court has simply "enacted" its own view of the best public
            policy. No doubt judicial convictions about public policy &#x97; whether and what kind
            of immunity is necessary or wise &#x97; have played a part, but the courts have been
            guided and constrained by common-law tradition, the relevant statutory background, and
            our constitutional structure and history. Our cases dealing with the immunity of Members
            of Congress are constructions of the Speech or Debate Clause and are guided by the
            history of such privileges at common law. The decisions dealing with the immunity of
            state officers involve the question of whether and to what extent Congress intended to
            abolish the common-law privileges by providing a remedy in the predecessor of 42 U. S.
            C. § 1983 for constitutional violations by state officials. Our decisions respecting
            immunity for federal officials &#x97; including absolute immunity for judges,
            prosecutors, and those officials doing similar work &#x97; also in large part reflect
            common-law views, as well as judicial conclusions as to what privileges are necessary if
            particular functions are to be performed in the public interest.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*770</span> Unfortunately, there is little of this
            approach in the Court's decision today. The Court casually, but candidly, abandons the
            functional approach to immunity that has run through all of our decisions. Ante, at
            755-756. Indeed, the majority turns this rule on its head by declaring that because the
            functions of the President's office are so varied and diverse and some of them so
            profoundly important, the office is unique and must be clothed with officewide, absolute
            immunity. This is policy, not law, and in my view, very poor policy.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>In declaring the President to be absolutely immune from suit for any deliberate and
            knowing violation of the Constitution or of a federal statute, the Court asserts that
            the immunity is "rooted in the constitutional tradition of the separation of powers and
            supported by our history."<span class="sup">[3]</span>Ante, at 749. The decision thus
            has all the earmarks of a constitutional pronouncement &#x97; absolute immunity for the
            President's office is mandated by the Constitution. Although the Court appears to
            disclaim this, ante, at 748-749, n. 27, it is difficult to read the opinion coherently
            as standing for any narrower proposition: Attempts to subject the President to liability
            either by Congress through a statutory action or by the courts through a Bivens (Bivens
            v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971)) proceeding would violate the
            separation of powers.<span class="sup">[4]</span> Such a generalized absolute immunity
            cannot be sustained when examined in the traditional manner and in light of the
            traditional judicial sources.</p>
         <p>The petitioner and the United States, as amicus,<span class="sup">[5]</span> rely
            principally on two arguments to support the claim of absolute <span
               class="star-pagination">*771</span> immunity for the President from civil liability:
            absolute immunity is an "incidental power" of the Presidency, historically recognized as
            implicit in the Constitution, and absolute immunity is required by the
            separation-of-powers doctrine. I will address each of these contentions.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>The Speech or Debate Clause, Art. I, § 6, guarantees absolute immunity to Members of
            Congress; nowhere, however, does the Constitution directly address the issue of
            Presidential immunity.<span class="sup">[6]</span> Petitioner nevertheless argues that
            the debates at the Constitutional Convention and the early history of constitutional
            interpretation demonstrate an implicit assumption of absolute Presidential immunity. In
            support of this position, petitioner relies primarily on three separate items: First,
            preratification remarks made during the discussion of Presidential impeachment at the
            Convention and in The <ref type="" num="">Federalist</ref>; second, remarks made during the meeting of the first
            Senate; and third, the views of Justice Story.</p>
         <p>The debate at the Convention on whether or not the President should be impeachable did
            touch on the potential dangers of subjecting the President to the control of another
            branch, the Legislature.<span class="sup">[7]</span> Gouverneur Morris, for example,
            complained of the potential for dependency and argued that "[the President] can do no
            criminal act without Coadjutors who may be punished. In case he should be re-elected,
            that will be sufficient proof of his innocence."<span class="sup">[8]</span> Colonel
            Mason <span class="star-pagination">*772</span> responded to this by asking if "any man
            [shall] be above Justice" and argued that this was least appropriate for the man "who
            can commit the most extensive injustice."<span class="sup">[9]</span> Madison agreed
            that "it [is] indispensable that some provision should be made for defending the
            Community agst the incapacity, negligence or perfidy of the chief Magistrate."<span
               class="sup">[10]</span> Pinckney responded on the other side, believing that if
            granted the power, the Legislature would hold impeachment "as a rod over the Executive
            and by that means effectually destroy his independence."<span class="sup">[11]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Petitioner concludes from this that the delegates meant impeachment to be the exclusive
            means of holding the President personally responsible for his misdeeds, outside of
            electoral politics. This conclusion, however, is hardly supported by the debate.
            Although some of the delegates expressed concern over limiting Presidential
            independence, the delegates voted 8 to 2 in favor of impeachment. Whatever the fear of
            subjecting the President to the power of another branch, it was not sufficient, or at
            least not sufficiently shared, to insulate the President from political liability in the
            impeachment process.</p>
         <p>Moreover, the Convention debate did not focus on wrongs the President might commit
            against individuals, but rather on whether there should be a method of holding him
            accountable for what might be termed wrongs against the state.<span class="sup"
               >[12]</span> Thus, examples of the abuses that concerned delegates were betrayal,
            oppression, and bribery; the delegates feared that the alternative to an impeachment
            mechanism would be "tumults &amp;amp; insurrections" by the people in response to such
               <span class="star-pagination">*773</span> abuses. 2 Farrand 67. The only conclusions
            that can be drawn from this debate are that the independence of the Executive was not
            understood to require a total lack of accountability to the other branches and that
            there was no general desire to insulate the President from the consequences of his
            improper acts.<span class="sup">[13]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Much the same can be said in response to petitioner's reliance on The <ref type="" num="77">Federalist</ref> No. 77.
            In that essay, Hamilton asked whether the Presidency combines "the requisites to safety
            in the republican sense &#x97; a due dependence on the people &#x97; a due
            responsibility." The <ref type="" num="77">Federalist</ref> No. 77, p. 520 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). He answered that the
            constitutional plan met this test because it subjected the President to both the
            electoral process and the possibility of impeachment, including subsequent criminal
            prosecution. Petitioner concludes from this that these were intended to be the exclusive
            means of restraining Presidential abuses. This, by no means follows. Hamilton was
            concerned in The <ref type="" num="77">Federalist</ref> No. 77, as were the delegates at the Convention, with the
            larger political abuses &#x97; "wrongs against the state" &#x97; that a President might
            commit. He did not consider what legal means might be available for redress of
            individualized grievances.<span class="sup">[14]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*774</span> That omission should not be taken to imply
            exclusion in these circumstances is well illustrated by comparing some of the remarks
            made in the state ratifying conventions with Hamilton's discussion in No. 77. In the
            North Carolina ratifying convention, for example, there was a discussion of the adequacy
            of the impeachment mechanism for holding executive officers accountable for their
            misdeeds. Governor Johnson defended the constitutional plan by distinguishing three
            legal mechanisms of accountability:</p> "If an officer commits an offence against an
         individual, he is amenable to the courts of law. If he commits crimes against the state, he
         may be indicted and punished. Impeachment only extends to high crimes and misdemeanors in a
         public office. It is a mode of trial pointed out for great misdemeanors against the
            public."<span class="sup">[15]</span>
         <p>Governor Johnson surely did not contemplate that the availability of an impeachment
            mechanism necessarily implied the exclusion of other forms of legal accountability;
            rather, the method of accountability was to be a function of the character of the wrong.
            Mr. Maclaine, another delegate to the North Carolina Convention, clearly believed that
            the courts would remain open to individual citizens seeking redress from injuries caused
            by Presidential acts:</p> "The President is the superior officer, who is to see the laws
         put in execution. He is amenable for any maladministration in his office. Were it possible
         to suppose that the President should give wrong instructions to his <span
            class="star-pagination">*775</span> deputies, whereby the citizens would be distressed,
         they would have redress in the ordinary courts of common law."<span class="sup">[16]</span>
         <p>A similar distinction between different possible forms of Presidential accountability
            was drawn by Mr. Wilson at the Pennsylvania ratifying convention:</p> "[The President]
         is placed high, and is possessed of power far from being contemptible; yet not a single
         privilege is annexed to his character; far from being above the laws, he is amenable to
         them in his private character as a citizen, and in his public character by
            impeachment."<span class="sup">[17]</span>
         <p>There is no more reason to respect the views of Hamilton than those of Wilson: both were
            members of the Constitutional Convention; both were instrumental in securing the
            ratification of the Constitution. But more importantly, there is simply no express
            contradiction in their statements. Petitioner relies on an inference drawn from silence
            to create this contradiction. The surrounding history simply does not support this
            inference.</p>
         <p>The second piece of historical evidence cited by petitioner is an exchange at the first
            meeting of the Senate, involving Vice President Adams and Senators Ellsworth and Maclay.
            The debate started over whether or not the words "the President" should be included at
            the beginning of federal writs, similar to the manner in which English writs ran in the
            King's name. Senator Maclay thought that this would improperly combine the executive and
            judicial branches. This, in turn, led to a discussion of the proper relation between the
            two. Senator Ellsworth and Vice President Adams defended the proposition that</p> "the
         President, personally, was not subject to any process whatever; could have no action,
         whatever, brought <span class="star-pagination">*776</span> against him; was above the
         power of all judges, justices, &amp;amp;c. For [that] would . . . put it in the power of a
         common justice to exercise any authority over him, and stop the whole machine of
            government."<span class="sup">[18]</span>
         <p>In their view the impeachment process was the exclusive form of process available
            against the President. Senator Maclay ardently opposed this view and put the case of a
            President committing "murder in the street." In his view, in such a case neither
            impeachment nor resurrection were the exclusive means of holding the President to the
            law; rather, there was "loyal justice." Senator Maclay, who recorded the exchange,
            concludes his notes with the remark that none of this "is worth minuting, but it shows
            clearly how amazingly fond of the old leaven many people are."<span class="sup"
               >[19]</span> In his view, Senator Ellsworth and his supporters had not fully
            comprehended the difference in the political position of the American President and that
            of the British Monarch. Again, nothing more can be concluded from this than that the
            proper scope of Presidential accountability, including the question whether the
            President should be subject to judicial process, was no clearer then than it is now.</p>
         <p>The final item cited by petitioner clearly supports his position, but is of such late
            date that it contributes little to understanding the original intent. In his
            Commentaries on the Constitution, published in 1833, Justice Story described the
            "incidental powers" of the President:</p> "Among these must necessarily be included the
         power to perform [his functions] without any obstruction or impediment whatsoever. The
         President cannot, therefore, be liable to arrest, imprisonment, or detention, while he is
         in the discharge of the duties of his office; and for this purpose his person must be
         deemed, in civil cases <span class="star-pagination">*777</span> at least, to possess an
         official inviolability. In the exercise of his political powers he is to use his own
         discretion, and he is accountable only to his country and to his own conscience. His
         decision in relation to these powers is subject to no control, and his discretion, when
         exercised, is conclusive."<span class="sup">[20]</span>
         <p>While Justice Story may have been firmly committed to this view in 1833, Senator
            Pinckney, a delegate to the Convention, was as firmly committed to the opposite view in
               1800.<span class="sup">[21]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Senator Pinckney, arguing on the floor of the Senate, contrasted the privileges extended
            to Members of Congress by the Constitution with the lack of any such privileges extended
            to the President.<span class="sup">[22]</span> He argued that this was a deliberate
            choice of the delegates to the Convention, who "well knew how oppressively the power of
            undefined privileges had been exercised in Great Britain, and were determined no such
            authority should ever be exercised here." 10 Annals of <span class="star-pagination"
               >*778</span> Cong. 72 (1800). Therefore, "[n]o privilege of this kind was intended
            for your Executive, nor any except that . . . for your Legislature." Id., at 74.<span
               class="sup">[23]</span>
         </p>
         <p>In previous immunity cases the Court has emphasized the importance of the immunity
            afforded the particular government official at common law. See Imbler v. Pachtman, 424
            U. S. 409, 421 (1976). Clearly this sort of analysis is not possible when dealing with
            an office, the Presidency, that did not exist at common law. To the extent that
            historical inquiry is appropriate in this context, it is constitutional history, not
               <span class="star-pagination">*779</span> common law, that is relevant. From the
            history discussed above, however, all that can be concluded is that absolute immunity
            from civil liability for the President finds no support in constitutional text or
            history, or in the explanations of the earliest commentators. This is too weak a ground
            to support a declaration by this Court that the President is absolutely immune from
            civil liability, regardless of the source of liability or the injury for which redress
            is sought. This much the majority implicitly concedes since history and text,
            traditional sources of judicial argument, merit only a footnote in the Court's opinion.
            Ante, at 750-752, n. 31.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B</h2>
         <p>No bright line can be drawn between arguments for absolute immunity based on the
            constitutional principle of separation of powers and arguments based on what the Court
            refers to as "public policy." This necessarily follows from the Court's functional
            interpretation of the separation-of-powers doctrine:</p> "[I]n determining whether the
         Act disrupts the proper balance between the coordinate branches, the proper inquiry focuses
         on the extent to which it prevents the Executive Branch from accomplishing its
         constitutionally assigned functions." Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S.
         425, 443 (1977). <p>See also United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 706-707 (1974);
            Youngstown Sheet &amp;amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 635 (1952) (Jackson, J.,
            concurring). Petitioner argues that public policy favors absolute immunity because
            absent such immunity the President's ability to execute his constitutionally mandated
            obligations will be impaired. The convergence of these two lines of argument is
            superficially apparent from the very fact that in both instances the approach of the
            Court has been characterized as a "functional" analysis.</p>
         <p>The difference is only one of degree. While absolute immunity might maximize executive
            efficiency and therefore be <span class="star-pagination">*780</span> a worthwhile
            policy, lack of such immunity may not so disrupt the functioning of the Presidency as to
            violate the separation-of-powers doctrine. Insofar as liability in this case is of
            congressional origin, petitioner must demonstrate that subjecting the President to a
            private damages action will prevent him from "accomplishing [his] constitutionally
            assigned functions." Insofar as liability is based on a Bivens action, perhaps a lower
            standard of functional disruption is appropriate. Petitioner has surely not met the
            former burden; I do not believe that he has met the latter standard either.</p>
         <p>Taken at face value, the Court's position that as a matter of constitutional law the
            President is absolutely immune should mean that he is immune not only from damages
            actions but also from suits for injunctive relief, criminal prosecutions and, indeed,
            from any kind of judicial process. But there is no contention that the President is
            immune from criminal prosecution in the courts under the criminal laws enacted by
            Congress or by the States for that matter. Nor would such a claim be credible. The
            Constitution itself provides that impeachment shall not bar "Indictment, Trial, Judgment
            and Punishment, according to Law." Art. I, § 3, cl. 7. Similarly, our cases indicate
            that immunity from damages actions carries no protection from criminal prosecution.
            Supra, at 765-766.</p>
         <p>Neither can there be a serious claim that the separation-of-powers doctrine insulates
            Presidential action from judicial review or insulates the President from judicial
            process. No argument is made here that the President, whatever his liability for money
            damages, is not subject to the courts' injunctive powers. See, e. g., Youngstown Sheet
            &amp;amp; Tube Co., supra; Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944); Panama
            Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388 (1935). Petitioner's attempt to draw an analogy to
            the Speech or Debate Clause, Brief for Petitioner 45, one purpose of which is "to
            prevent . . . accountability before a possibly hostile judiciary," Gravel v. United
            States, 408 U. S., at 617, breaks <span class="star-pagination">*781</span> down at just
            this point. While the Speech or Debate Clause guarantees that "for any Speech or Debate"
            Congressmen "shall not be questioned in any other Place," and, thus, assures that
            Congressmen, in their official capacity, shall not be the subject of the courts'
            injunctive powers, no such protection is afforded the Executive. Indeed, as the cases
            cited above indicate, it is the rule, not the exception, that executive actions &#x97;
            including those taken at the immediate direction of the President &#x97; are subject to
            judicial review.<span class="sup">[24]</span> Regardless of the possibility of money
            damages against the President, then, the constitutionality of the President's actions or
            their legality under the applicable statutes can and will be subject to review. Indeed,
            in this very case, respondent Fitzgerald's dismissal was set aside by the Civil Service
            Commission as contrary to the applicable regulations issued pursuant to authority
            granted by Congress.</p>
         <p>Nor can private damages actions be distinguished on the ground that such claims would
            involve the President personally in the litigation in a way not necessitated by suits
            seeking declaratory or injunctive relief against certain Presidential actions. The
            President has been held to be subject to judicial process at least since 1807. United
            States v. Burr, <span class="citation">

            </span> (No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807) (Marshall, C. J., sitting as Circuit Justice). Burr
            "squarely ruled that a subpoena may be directed to the President." Nixon v. Sirica, 159
            U. S. App. D. C. 58, 67, 487 F. 2d 700, 709 (1973). Chief Justice Marshall flatly
            rejected any suggestion that all judicial process, in and of itself, constitutes an
            unwarranted interference in the Presidency:</p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*782</span> "The guard, furnished to this high officer, to
         protect him from being harassed by vexatious and unnecessary subpoenas, is to be looked for
         in the conduct of a court after those subpoenas have issued; not in any circumstance which
         is to precede their being issued." 25 F. Cas., at 34 (emphasis added). <p>This position was
            recently rearticulated by the Court in United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S., at 706:</p>
         "[N]either the doctrine of separation of powers, nor the need for confidentiality . . .
         without more, can sustain an absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from
         judicial process under all circumstances." <p>These two lines of cases establish, then,
            that neither subjecting Presidential actions to a judicial determination of their
            constitutionality, nor subjecting the President to judicial process violates the
            separation-of-powers doctrine. Similarly, neither has been held to be sufficiently
            intrusive to justify a judicially declared rule of immunity. With respect to intrusion
            by the judicial process itself on executive functions, subjecting the President to
            private claims for money damages involves no more than this. If there is a
            separation-of-powers problem here, it must be found in the nature of the remedy and not
            in the process involved.</p>
         <p>We said in Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478 (1978), that "it is not unfair to hold liable
            the official who knows or should know he is acting outside the law, and . . . insisting
            on an awareness of clearly established constitutional limits will not unduly interfere
            with the exercise of official judgment." Id., at 506-507. Today's decision in Harlow v.
            Fitzgerald, post, p. 800, makes clear that the President, were he subject to civil
            liability, could be held liable only for an action that he knew, or as an objective
            matter should have known, was illegal and a clear abuse of his authority and power. In
            such circumstances, the question that must be answered is who should bear the cost of
            the resulting injury &#x97; the wrongdoer or the victim.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*783</span> The principle that should guide the Court in
            deciding this question was stated long ago by Chief Justice Marshall: "The very essence
            of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the
            protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury." Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch,
            at 163. Much more recently, the Court considered the role of a damages remedy in the
            performance of the courts' traditional function of enforcing federally guaranteed
            rights: "Historically, damages have been regarded as the ordinary remedy for an invasion
            of personal interests in liberty." Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.
            S., at 395.<span class="sup">[25]</span> To the extent that the Court denies an
            otherwise appropriate remedy, it denies the victim the right to be made whole and,
            therefore, denies him "the protection of the laws."<span class="sup">[26]</span>
         </p>
         <p>That the President should have the same remedial obligations toward those whom he
            injures as any other federal officer is not a surprising proposition. The fairness of
            the remedial principle the Court has so far followed &#x97; that the wrongdoer, not the
            victim, should ordinarily bear the costs of the injury &#x97; has been found to be
            outweighed only in instances where potential liability is "thought to injure the
            governmental decisionmaking process." Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S., at 437 (WHITE, J.,
            concurring in judgment). The argument for immunity is that the possibility of a damages
            action will, or at least should, have an effect on the performance <span
               class="star-pagination">*784</span> of official responsibilities. That effect should
            be to deter unconstitutional, or otherwise illegal, behavior. This may, however, lead
            officers to be more careful and "less vigorous" in the performance of their duties.
            Caution, of course, is not always a virtue and undue caution is to be avoided.</p>
         <p>The possibility of liability may, in some circumstances, distract officials from the
            performance of their duties and influence the performance of those duties in ways
            adverse to the public interest. But when this "public policy" argument in favor of
            absolute immunity is cast in these broad terms, it applies to all officers, both state
            and federal: All officers should perform their responsibilities without regard to those
            personal interests threatened by the possibility of a lawsuit. See Imbler, supra, at 436
            (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment).<span class="sup">[27]</span> Inevitably, this
            reduces the public policy argument to nothing more than an expression of judicial
            inclination as to which officers should be encouraged to perform their functions with
            "vigor," although with less care.<span class="sup">[28]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The Court's response, until today, to this problem has been to apply the argument to
            individual functions, not offices, and to evaluate the effect of liability on
            governmental decisionmaking within that function, in light of the substantive ends that
            are to be encouraged or discouraged. In this case, therefore, the Court should examine
            the functions implicated by the causes of action at issue here and the effect of
            potential liability on the performance of those functions.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>
            <span class="star-pagination">*785</span> II</h2>
         <p>The functional approach to the separation-of-powers doctrine and the Court's more recent
            immunity decisions<span class="sup">[29]</span> converge on the following principle: The
            scope of immunity is determined by function, not office. The wholesale claim that the
            President is entitled to absolute immunity in all of his actions stands on no firmer
            ground than did the claim that all Presidential communications are entitled to an
            absolute privilege, which was rejected in favor of a functional analysis, by a unanimous
            Court in United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683 (1974). Therefore, whatever may be true
            of the necessity of such a broad immunity in certain areas of executive
               responsibility,<span class="sup">[30]</span> the only question that must be answered
            here is whether the dismissal of employees falls within a constitutionally assigned
            executive function, the performance of which would be substantially impaired by the
            possibility of a private action for damages. I believe it does not.</p>
         <p>Respondent has so far proceeded in this action on the basis of three separate causes of
            action: two federal statutes &#x97; 5 U. S. C. § 7211 (1976 ed., Supp. IV) and 18 U. S.
            C. § 1505 &#x97; and the First Amendment. At this point in the litigation, the
            availability of these causes of action is not before us. Assuming the correctness of the
            lower court's determination that the two federal statutes create a private right of
            action, I find the suggestion that the President is immune from those causes of action
            to be unconvincing. The attempt to found such immunity upon a separation-of-powers
            argument is particularly unconvincing.</p>
         <p>The first of these statutes, 5 U. S. C. § 7211 (1976 ed., Supp. IV), states that "[t]he
            right of employees . . . to . . . <span class="star-pagination">*786</span> furnish
            information to either House of Congress, or to a committee or Member thereof, may not be
            interfered with or denied." The second, 18 U. S. C. § 1505, makes it a crime to obstruct
            congressional testimony. It does not take much insight to see that at least one purpose
            of these statutes is to assure congressional access to information in the possession of
            the Executive Branch, which Congress believes it requires in order to carry out its
               responsibilities.<span class="sup">[31]</span> Insofar as these statutes implicate a
            separation-of-powers argument, I would think it to be just the opposite of that
            suggested by petitioner and accepted by the majority. In enacting these statutes,
            Congress sought to preserve its own constitutionally mandated functions in the face of a
            recalcitrant Executive.<span class="sup">[32]</span> Thus, the separation-of-powers
            problem addressed by these statutes was first of all Presidential behavior that intruded
            upon, or burdened, Congress' performance of its own constitutional responsibilities. It
            is no response to this to say that such a cause of action would disrupt the President in
            the <span class="star-pagination">*787</span> furtherance of his responsibilities. That
            approach ignores the separation-of-powers problem that lies behind the congressional
            action; it assumes that Presidential functions are to be valued over congressional
            functions.</p>
         <p>The argument that Congress, by providing a damages action under these statutes (as is
            assumed in this case), has adopted an unconstitutional means of furthering its ends,
            must rest on the premise that Presidential control of executive employment decisions is
            a constitutionally assigned Presidential function with which Congress may not
            significantly interfere. This is a frivolous contention. In United States v. Perkins,
            116 U. S. 483, 485 (1886), this Court held that "when Congress, by law, vests the
            appointment of inferior officers in the heads of Departments it may limit and restrict
            the power of removal as it deems best for the public interest." Whatever the rule may be
            with respect to high officers, see Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U. S. 602
            (1935), with respect to those who fill traditional bureaucratic positions, restrictions
            on executive authority are the rule and not the exception.<span class="sup">[33]</span>
            This case itself demonstrates the severe statutory restraints under which the President
            operates in this area.</p>
         <p>Fitzgerald was a civil service employee working in the Office of the Secretary of the
            Air Force. Although his position was such as to fall within the "excepted" service,
            which would ordinarily mean that civil service rules and regulations applicable to
            removals would not protect him, 5 CFR § 6.4 (1982), his status as a veteran entitled him
            to special protections. Veterans are entitled to certain civil service benefits afforded
            to "preference eligibles." 5 U. S. C. § 2108 (1976 ed. and Supp. IV). These benefits
            include that set forth in 5 U. S. C. § 7513 (a) (1976 ed., Supp. IV): "[A]n agency may
            take [adverse action] against an employee only for such cause as will promote the
            efficiency of the service." <span class="star-pagination">*788</span> Similarly, his
            veteran status entitled Fitzgerald to the protection of the reduction-in-force
            procedures established by civil service regulation. 5 U. S. C. §§ 3501, 3502 (1976 ed.
            and Supp. IV). It was precisely those procedures that the Chief Examiner for the Civil
            Service Commission found had been violated, in his 1973 recommendation that respondent
            be reappointed to his old position or to a job of comparable authority.</p>
         <p>This brief review is enough to illustrate my point: Personnel decisions of the sort
            involved in this case are emphatically not a constitutionally assigned Presidential
            function that will tolerate no interference by either of the other two branches of
            Government. More important than this "quantitative" analysis of the degree of intrusion
            in Presidential decisionmaking permitted in this area, however, is the "qualitative"
            analysis suggested in Part I-B above.</p>
         <p>Absolute immunity is appropriate when the threat of liability may bias the decisionmaker
            in ways that are adverse to the public interest. But as the various regulations and
            statutes protecting civil servants from arbitrary executive action illustrate, this is
            an area in which the public interest is demonstrably on the side of encouraging less
            "vigor" and more "caution" on the part of decisionmakers. That is, the very steps that
            Congress has taken to assure that executive employees will be able freely to testify in
            Congress and to assure that they will not be subject to arbitrary adverse actions
            indicate that those policy arguments that have elsewhere justified absolute immunity are
            not applicable here. Absolute immunity would be nothing more than a judicial declaration
            of policy that directly contradicts the policy of protecting civil servants reflected in
            the statutes and regulations.</p>
         <p>If respondent could, in fact, have proceeded on his two statutory claims, the Bivens
            action would be superfluous. Respondent may not collect damages twice, and the same
            injuries are put forward by respondent as the basis for both the statutory and
            constitutional claims. As we have said before, "were Congress to create equally
            effective alternative <span class="star-pagination">*789</span> remedies, the need for
            damages relief [directly under the Constitution] might be obviated." Davis v. Passman,
            442 U. S. 228, 248 (1979). Nevertheless, because the majority decides that the President
            is absolutely immune from a Bivens action as well, I shall express my disagreement with
            that conclusion.</p>
         <p>In Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), we held that
            individuals who have suffered a compensable injury through a violation of the rights
            guaranteed them by the Fourth Amendment may invoke the general federal-question
            jurisdiction of the federal courts in a suit for damages. That conclusion rested on two
            principles: First, " `[t]he very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the
            right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws,' " id., at 397, quoting
            Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, at 163; second, "[h]istorically, damages have been
            regarded as the ordinary remedy for an invasion of personal interests in liberty." 403
            U. S., at 395. In Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478 (1978), we rejected the argument of
            the Federal Government that federal officers, including Cabinet officers, are absolutely
            immune from civil liability for such constitutional violations &#x97; a position that we
            recognized would substantially undercut our conclusion in Bivens. We held there that
            although the performance of certain limited functions will be protected by the shield of
            absolute immunity, the general rule is that federal officers, like state officers, have
            only a qualified immunity. Finally, in Davis v. Passman, supra, we held that a
            Congressman could be held liable for damages in a Bivens-type suit brought in federal
            court alleging a violation of individual rights guaranteed the plaintiff by the Due
            Process Clause. In my view, these cases have largely settled the issues raised by the
            Bivens problem here.</p>
         <p>These cases established the following principles. First, it is not the exclusive
            prerogative of the Legislative Branch to create a federal cause of action for a
            constitutional violation. In the absence of adequate legislatively prescribed remedies,
            the general federal-question jurisdiction of the federal <span class="star-pagination"
               >*790</span> courts permits the courts to create remedies, both legal and equitable,
            appropriate to the character of the injury. Second, exercise of this "judicial" function
            does not create a separation-of-powers problem: We have held both executive and
            legislative officers subject to this judicially created cause of action and in each
            instance we have rejected separation-of-powers arguments. Holding federal officers
            liable for damages for constitutional injuries no more violates separation-of-powers
            principles than does imposing equitable remedies under the traditional function of
            judicial review. Third, federal officials will generally have a "qualified immunity"
            from such suits; absolute immunity will be extended to certain functions only on the
            basis of a showing that exposure to liability is inconsistent with the proper
            performance of the official's duties and responsibilities. Finally, Congress retains the
            power to restrict exposure to liability, and the policy judgments implicit in this
            decision should properly be made by Congress.</p>
         <p>The majority fails to recognize the force of what the Court has already done in this
            area. Under the above principles, the President could not claim that there are no
            circumstances under which he would be subject to a Bivens-type action for violating
            respondent's constitutional rights. Rather, he must assert that the absence of absolute
            immunity will substantially impair his ability to carry out particular functions that
            are his constitutional responsibility. For the reasons I have presented above, I do not
            believe that this argument can be successfully made under the circumstances of this
            case.</p>
         <p>It is, of course, theoretically possible that the President should be held to be
            absolutely immune because each of the functions for which he has constitutional
            responsibility would be substantially impaired by the possibility of civil liability. I
            do not think this argument is valid for the simple reason that the function involved
            here does not have this character. <span class="star-pagination">*791</span> On which
            side of the line other Presidential functions would fall need not be decided in this
            case.</p>
         <p>The majority opinion suggests a variant of this argument. It argues, not that every
            Presidential function has this character, but that distinguishing the particular
            functions involved in any given case would be "difficult." Ante, at 756.<span
               class="sup">[34]</span> Even if this were true, it would not necessarily follow that
            the President is entitled to absolute immunity: That would still depend on whether, in
            those unclear instances, it is likely to be the case that one of the functions
            implicated deserves the protection of absolute immunity. In this particular case, I see
            no such function.<span class="sup">[35]</span>
         </p>
         <p>I do not believe that subjecting the President to a Bivens action would create
            separation-of-powers problems or "public policy" problems different from those involved
            in subjecting the President to a statutory cause of action.<span class="sup">[36]</span>
            Relying upon <span class="star-pagination">*792</span> the history and text of the
            Constitution, as well as the analytic method of our prior cases, I conclude that these
            problems are not sufficient to justify absolute immunity for the President in general,
            nor under the circumstances of this case in particular.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>Because of the importance of this case, it is appropriate to examine the reasoning of
            the majority opinion.</p>
         <p>The opinion suffers from serious ambiguity even with respect to the most fundamental
            point: How broad is the immunity granted the President? The opinion suggests that its
            scope is limited by the fact that under none of the asserted causes of action "has
            Congress taken express legislative action to subject the President to civil liability
            for his official acts." Ante, at 748. We are never told, however, how or why
            congressional action could make a difference. It is not apparent that any of the
            propositions relied upon by the majority to immunize the President would not apply
            equally to such a statutory cause of action; nor does the majority indicate what new
            principles would operate to undercut those propositions.</p>
         <p>In the end, the majority seems to overcome its initial hesitation, for it announces that
            "[w]e consider [absolute] immunity a functionally mandated incident of the President's
            unique office, rooted in the constitutional tradition of the separation of powers and
            supported by our history," ante, at 749. See also ante, at 757 ("A rule of absolute
            immunity for the President will not leave the Nation without sufficient protection
            against misconduct on the part of the Chief Executive").<span class="sup">[37]</span>
            While the majority opinion recognizes that "[i]t is <span class="star-pagination"
               >*793</span> settled law that the separation-of-powers doctrine does not bar every
            exercise of jurisdiction over the President of the United States," it bases its
            conclusion, at least in part, on a suggestion that there is a special jurisprudence of
            the Presidency. Ante, at 753-754.<span class="sup">[38]</span>
         </p>
         <p>But in United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683 (1974), we upheld the power of a Federal
            District Court to issue a subpoena duces tecum against the President. In other cases we
            have enjoined executive officials from carrying out Presidential directives. See, e. g.,
            Youngstown Sheet &amp;amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579 (1952). Not until this case
            has there ever been a suggestion that the mere formalism of the name appearing on the
            complaint was more important in resolving separation-of-powers problems than the
            substantive character of the judicial intrusion upon executive functions.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*794</span> The majority suggests that the
            separation-of-powers doctrine permits exercising jurisdiction over the President only in
            those instances where "judicial action is needed to serve broad public interests &#x97;
            as when the Court acts, not in derogation of the separation of powers, but to maintain
            their proper balance." Ante, at 754. Without explanation, the majority contends that a
            "merely private suit for damages" does not serve this function. Ibid.</p>
         <p>The suggestion that enforcement of the rule of law &#x97; i. e., subjecting the
            President to rules of general applicability &#x97; does not further the separation of
            powers, but rather is in derogation of this purpose, is bizarre. At stake in a suit of
            this sort, to the extent that it is based upon a statutorily created cause of action, is
            the ability of Congress to assert legal restraints upon the Executive and of the courts
            to perform their function of providing redress for legal harm. Regardless of what the
            Court might think of the merits of Mr. Fitzgerald's claim, the idea that pursuit of
            legal redress offends the doctrine of separation of powers is a frivolous contention
            passing as legal argument.</p>
         <p>Similarly, the majority implies that the assertion of a constitutional cause of action
            &#x97; the whole point of which is to assure that an officer does not transgress the
            constitutional limits on his authority &#x97; may offend separation-of-powers concerns.
            This is surely a perverse approach to the Constitution: Whatever the arguments in favor
            of absolute immunity may be, it is untenable to argue that subjecting the President to
            constitutional restrictions will undercut his "unique" role in our system of government.
            It cannot be seriously argued that the President must be placed beyond the law and
            beyond judicial enforcement of constitutional restraints upon executive officers in
            order to implement the principle of separation of powers.</p>
         <p>Focusing on the actual arguments the majority offers for its holding of absolute
            immunity for the President, one finds surprisingly little. As I read the relevant
            section of the <span class="star-pagination">*795</span> Court's opinion, I find just
            three contentions from which the majority draws this conclusion. Each of them is little
            more than a makeweight; together they hardly suffice to justify the wholesale disregard
            of our traditional approach to immunity questions.</p>
         <p>First, the majority informs us that the President occupies a "unique position in the
            constitutional scheme," including responsibilities for the administration of justice,
            foreign affairs, and management of the Executive Branch. Ante, at 749-750. True as this
            may be, it says nothing about why a "unique" rule of immunity should apply to the
            President. The President's unique role may indeed encompass functions for which he is
            entitled to a claim of absolute immunity. It does not follow from that, however, that he
            is entitled to absolute immunity either in general or in this case in particular.</p>
         <p>For some reason, the majority believes that this uniqueness of the President shifts the
            burden to respondent to prove that a rule of absolute immunity does not apply. The
            respondent has failed in this effort, the Court suggests, because the President's
            uniqueness makes "inapposite" any analogy to our cases dealing with other executive
            officers. Ante, at 750. Even if this were true, it would not follow that the President
            is entitled to absolute immunity; it would only mean that a particular argument is out
            of place. But the fact is that it is not true. There is nothing in the President's
            unique role that makes the arguments used in those other cases inappropriate.</p>
         <p>Second, the majority contends that because the President's "visibility" makes him
            particularly vulnerable to suits for civil damages, ante, at 753, a rule of absolute
            immunity is required. The force of this argument is surely undercut by the majority's
            admission that "there is no historical record of numerous suits against the President."
            Ante, at 753, n. 33. Even granting that a Bivens cause of action did not become
            available until 1971, in the 11 years since then there have <span
               class="star-pagination">*796</span> been only a handful of suits. Many of these are
            frivolous and dealt with in a routine manner by the courts and the Justice Department.
            There is no reason to think that, in the future, the protection afforded by summary
            judgment procedures would not be adequate to protect the President, as they currently
            protect other executive officers from unfounded litigation. Indeed, given the decision
            today in Harlow v. Fitzgerald, post, p. 800, there is even more reason to believe that
            frivolous claims will not intrude upon the President's time. Even if judicial procedures
            were found not to be sufficient, Congress remains free to address this problem if and
            when it develops.</p>
         <p>Finally, the Court suggests that potential liability "frequently could distract a
            President from his public duties." Ante, at 753. Unless one assumes that the President
            himself makes the countless high-level executive decisions required in the
            administration of government, this rule will not do much to insulate such decisions from
            the threat of liability. The logic of the proposition cannot be limited to the
            President; its extension, however, has been uniformly rejected by this Court. See Butz
            v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478 (1978); Harlow v. Fitzgerald, post, p. 800. Furthermore, in
            no instance have we previously held legal accountability in itself to be an
            unjustifiable cost. The availability of the courts to vindicate constitutional and
            statutory wrongs has been perceived and protected as one of the virtues of our system of
            delegated and limited powers. As I argued in Part I, our concern in fashioning absolute
            immunity rules has been that liability may pervert the decisionmaking process in a
            particular function by undercutting the values we expect to guide those decisions.
            Except for the empty generality that the President should have " `the maximum ability to
            deal fearlessly and impartially with' the duties of his office," ante, at 752, the
            majority nowhere suggests a particular, disadvantageous effect on a specific
            Presidential function. The caution that comes from requiring reasonable choices in areas
            that <span class="star-pagination">*797</span> may intrude on individuals' legally
            protected rights has never before been counted as a cost.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>IV</h2>
         <p>The majority may be correct in its conclusion that "[a] rule of absolute immunity . . .
            will not leave the Nation without sufficient protection against misconduct on the part
            of the Chief Executive." Ante, at 757. Such a rule will, however, leave Mr. Fitzgerald
            without an adequate remedy for the harms that he may have suffered. More importantly, it
            will leave future plaintiffs without a remedy, regardless of the substantiality of their
            claims. The remedies in which the Court finds comfort were never designed to afford
            relief for individual harms. Rather, they were designed as political safety valves.
            Politics and history, however, are not the domain of the courts; the courts exist to
            assure each individual that he, as an individual, has enforceable rights that he may
            pursue to achieve a peaceful redress of his legitimate grievances.</p>
         <p>I find it ironic, as well as tragic, that the Court would so casually discard its own
            role of assuring "the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws,"
            Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, at 163, in the name of protecting the principle of
            separation of powers. Accordingly, I dissent.</p></div>
      <div type="dissent" judge="blackmun">
         <p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting.</p>
         <p>I join JUSTICE WHITE's dissent. For me, the Court leaves unanswered his unanswerable
            argument that no man, not even the President of the United States, is absolutely and
            fully above the law. See United States v. Lee, 106 U. S. 196, 220 (1882),<span
               class="sup">[1]</span> and Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 163 <span
               class="star-pagination">*798</span> (1803).<span class="sup">[2]</span> Until today,
            I had thought this principle was the foundation of our national jurisprudence. It now
            appears that it is not.</p>
         <p>Nor can I understand the Court's holding that the absolute immunity of the President is
            compelled by separation-of-powers concerns, when the Court at the same time expressly
            leaves open, ante, at 748, and n. 27, the possibility that the President nevertheless
            may be fully subject to congressionally created forms of liability. These two concepts,
            it seems to me, cannot coexist.</p>
         <p>I also write separately to express my unalleviated concern about the parties' settlement
            agreement, the key details of which were not disclosed to the Court by counsel until the
            veritable "last minute," and even then, only because the Halperins' motion to intervene
            had directed the Court's attention to them. See ante, at 743-744, n. 24. The Court makes
            only passing mention of this agreement in Part II-B of its opinion.</p>
         <p>For me, the case in effect was settled before argument by petitioner's payment of
            $142,000 to respondent. A much smaller sum of $28,000 was left riding on an outcome
            favorable to respondent, with nothing at all to be paid if petitioner prevailed, as
            indeed he now does. The parties publicly stated that the amount of any payment would
            depend upon subsequent proceedings in the District Court; in fact, the parties
            essentially had agreed that, regardless of this Court's ruling, no further proceedings
            of substance would occur in the District Court. Surely, had the details of this
            agreement been known at the time the petition for certiorari came before the Court,
            certiorari would have been denied. I cannot escape the feeling that this
            long-undisclosed agreement <span class="star-pagination">*799</span> comes close to
            being a wager on the outcome of the case, with all of the implications that entails.</p>
         <p>Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U. S. 363 (1982), most recently &#x97; and, it now
            appears, most conveniently &#x97; decided, affords less than comfortable support for
            retaining the case.<span class="sup">[3]</span> The pertinent question here is not
            whether the case is moot, but whether this is the kind of case or controversy over which
            we should exercise our power of discretionary review. Cf. United States v. Johnson, 319
            U. S. 302 (1943).</p>
         <p>Apprised of all developments, I therefore would have dismissed the writ as having been
            improvidently granted. The Court, it seems to me, brushes by this factor in order to
            resolve an issue of profound consequence that otherwise would not be here. Lacking
            support for such a dismissal, however, I join the dissent.</p>

            embarrassed and angered by Fitzgerald's testimony. Within less than two months of
            respondent's congressional appearance, staff had prepared a memorandum for the outgoing
            Secretary of the Air Force, Harold Brown, listing three ways in which Fitzgerald might
            be removed from his position. See App. 209a-211a (memorandum of John Lang to Harold
            Brown, Jan. 6, 1969). Among these was a "reduction in force" &#x97; the means by which
            Fitzgerald ultimately was removed by Brown's successor in office under the new Nixon
            administration. The reduction in force was announced publicly on November 4, 1969, and
            Fitzgerald accordingly was separated from the Air Force upon the elimination of his job
            on January 5, 1970.</p>

            before the Subcommittee on Economy in Government of the Joint Economic Committee, 91st
            Cong., 1st Sess. (1969). Some 60 Members of Congress also signed a letter to the
            President protesting the "firing of this dedicated public servant" as a "punitive
            action." Id., at 115-116.</p>
         <p>[3] A briefing memorandum on the Fitzgerald matter had been prepared by White House
            staff in anticipation of a possible inquiry at the forthcoming press conference.
            Authored by aide Patrick Buchanan, it advanced the view that the Air Force was "firing .
            . . a good public servant." App. 269a (memorandum of Patrick Buchanan to Richard Nixon,
            Dec. 5, 1969). The memorandum suggested that the President order Fitzgerald's retention
            by the Defense Department.</p>

         <p>[5] See id., at 109a-112a (deposition of H. R. Haldeman); id., at 137a-141a (deposition
            of petitioner Richard Nixon). Haldeman's deposed testimony was based on his handwritten
            notes of December 12, 1969. Id., at 275a.</p>
         <p>[6] See id., at 126a (deposition of Robert Mayo); id., at 141a (deposition of Richard
            Nixon).</p>
         <p>[7] Both Mayo and his deputy, James Schlesinger, appear to have resisted at least partly
            due to a suspicion that Fitzgerald lacked institutional loyalty to executive policies
            and that he spoke too freely in communications with friends on Capitol Hill. Both also
            stated that high-level positions were presently unavailable within the Bureau of the
            Budget. See id., at 126a (deposition of Robert Mayo); id., at 146a-147a (deposition of
            James Schlesinger).</p>

            cited page in the Joint Appendix.)</p>
         <p>[9] Id., at 85a. The memorandum added that " `[w]e owe "first choice on Fitzgerald" to
            [Senator] Proxmire and others who tried so hard to make him a hero [for exposing the
            cost overruns].' " Suspicion of Fitzgerald's assumed loyalty toward Senator Proxmire was
            widely shared in the White House and in the Defense Department. According to the CSC
            Decision, supra: </p>
         <p>"While Mr. Fitzgerald has denied that he was `Senator Proxmier's [sic] boy in the Air
            Force', and he may honestly believe it, we find this statement difficult to accept. It
            is evident that the top officials in the Air Force, without specifically saying so,
            considered him to be just that. . . . We also note that upon leaving the Air Force Mr.
            Fitzgerald was employed as a consultant by the Proxmire Committee and that Senator
            Proxmire appeared at the Commission hearing as a character witness for [Fitzgerald]."

         <p>[13] Id., at 185a. A few hours after the press conference, Mr. Nixon repeated privately
            to Presidential aide Charles Colson that he had ordered Fitzgerald's firing. Id., at
            214a-215a (recorded conversation of Jan. 31, 1973).</p>
         <p>[14] Id., at 196a (transcription of statement of White House press secretary Ronald
            Ziegler, Feb. 1, 1973). In a conversation with aide John Ehrlichman, following his
            conversation with Charles Colson, see n. 13, supra, the President again had claimed
            responsibility for Fitzgerald's dismissal. When Ehrlichman corrected him on several
            details, however, the President concluded that he was "thinkin' of another case." Id.,
            at 218a (recorded conversation of Jan. 31, 1973). See id., at 220a. It was after this
            conversation that the retraction was ordered.</p>
         <p>[15] Fitzgerald's position in the Air Force was in the "excepted service" and therefore
            not covered by civil service rules and regulations for the competitive service.
            Fitzgerald v. Hampton, 152 U. S. App. D. C. 1, 4, 467 F. 2d 755, 758 (1972); see CSC
            Decision, App. 63a-64a. In Hampton, however, the court held that Fitzgerald's employment
            nonetheless was under "legislative protection," since he was a "preference eligible"
            veteran entitled to various statutory protections under the Veterans' Preference Act.
            See 152 U. S. App. D. C., at 4-14, 467 F. 2d, at 758-768. Among these were the benefits
            of the reduction-in-force procedures established by civil service regulation. See id.,
            at 4, 467 F. 2d, at 758.</p>
         <p>[16] The Examiner found that Fitzgerald in fact was dismissed because of his superiors'
            dissatisfaction with his job performance. App. 86a-87a. Their attitude was evidenced by
            "statements that he was not a `team player' and `not on the Air Force team.' " Id., at
            83a. Without deciding whether this would have been an adequate basis for an "adverse
            action" against Fitzgerald as an "inadequate or unsatisfactory employee," id., at 86a,
            the Examiner held that the Commission's adverse action procedures, current version
            codified at 5 CFR pt. 752 (1982), implicitly forbade the Air Force to employ a
            "reduction in force" as a means of dismissing respondent for reasons "personal to" him.
            App. 87a.</p>
         <p>[17] The Commission also ordered that Fitzgerald should receive backpay. Id., at
            87a-88a. Following the Commission's order, respondent was offered a new position with
            the Defense Department, but not one that he regarded as equivalent to his former
            employment. Fitzgerald accordingly filed an enforcement action in the District Court.
            This litigation ultimately culminated in a settlement agreement. Under its terms the
            United States Air Force agreed to reassign Fitzgerald to his former position as
            Management Systems Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, effective June
            21, 1982. See Settlement Agreement in Fitzgerald v. Hampton et al., Civ. No. 76-1486 (DC
            June 15, 1982).</p>
         <p>[18] The complaint alleged a continuing conspiracy to deprive him of his job, to deny
            him reemployment, and to besmirch his reputation. Fitzgerald alleged that the conspiracy
            had continued through the Commission hearings and remained in existence at the
            initiation of the lawsuit. See Fitzgerald v. Seamans, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/dcd/82oS/fitzgerald-v-seamans/">

               </a>
            </span>, 690-692 (DC 1974).</p>
         <p>[19] The general allegations of the complaint remained essentially unchanged. In
            averring Nixon's participation in the alleged conspiracy against him, the complaint
            quoted petitioner's press conference statement that he was "totally aware" of and in
            fact "approved" Fitzgerald's dismissal. Second Amended Complaint in Fitzgerald v.
            Butterfield, Civ. No. 74-78 (DC), p. 6.</p>
         <p>[20] See App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a-2a. The District Court held that respondent was
            entitled to "infer" a cause of action under 5 U. S. C. § 7211 (1976 ed., Supp. IV) and
            18 U. S. C. § 1505. Neither expressly confers a private right to sue for relief in
            damages. The first, 5 U. S. C. § 7211 (1976 ed., Supp. IV), provides generally that
            "[t]he right of employees . . . to . . . furnish information to either House of
            Congress, or to a committee or Member thereof, may not be interfered with or denied."
            The second, 18 U. S. C. § 1505, is a criminal statute making it a crime to obstruct
            congressional testimony. The correctness of the decision that a cause of action could be
            "implied" under these statutes is not currently before us. As explained infra, this case
            is here under the "collateral order" doctrine, for review of the District Court's denial
            of petitioner's motion to dismiss on the ground that he enjoyed absolute immunity from
            civil suit. The District Court also held that respondent had stated a claim under the
            common law of the District of Columbia, but respondent subsequently abandoned his
            common-law cause of action. See Supplemental Brief in Opposition 2.</p>
         <p>[21] See Brief in Opposition 2. Although Fitzgerald has not continued to urge this
            argument, the challenge was jurisdictional, and we therefore address it.</p>
         <p>[22] The statute provides in pertinent part: </p>
         <p>"Cases in the courts of appeals may be reviewed by the Supreme Court by the following
            methods:</p>
         <p>"(1) By writ of certiorari granted upon the petition of any party to any civil or
            criminal case, before or after rendition of judgment or decree . . . ."</p>
         <p>[23] There can be no serious doubt concerning our power to review a court of appeals'
            decision to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction &#x97; a power we have exercised routinely.
            See, e. g., Gardner v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., 437 U. S. 478 (1978). If we lacked
            authority to do so, decisions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction would be insulated
            entirely from review by this Court. </p>
         <p>Nor, now that we have taken jurisdiction of the case, need we remand to the Court of
            Appeals for a decision on the merits. The immunity question is a pure issue of law,
            appropriate for our immediate resolution. Especially in light of the Court of Appeals'
            now-binding decision of the issue presented, concerns of judicial economy fully warrant
            our decision of the important question presented.</p>
         <p>[24] Respondent filed a copy of this agreement with the Clerk of this Court on August
            24, 1981, as an appendix to his brief in opposition to a motion of Morton, Ina, David,
            Mark, and Gary Halperin to intervene and for other relief. On June 10, 1980, prior to
            the Court's action on the petition for certiorari, counsel to the parties had advised
            the Court that their clients had reached an agreement to liquidate damages, but that
            there remained a live controversy. Counsel did not include a copy of the agreement in
            their initial submission.</p>
         <p>[25] Spalding v. Vilas, 161 U. S. 483 (1896), was distinguished on the ground that the
            suit against the Postmaster General had asserted a common-law &#x97; and not a
            constitutional &#x97; cause of action. See Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S., at 493-495.</p>
         <p>[26] Although the Court in Butz v. Economou, supra, at 508, described the requisite
            inquiry as one of "public policy," the focus of inquiry more accurately may be viewed in
            terms of the "inherent" or "structural" assumptions of our scheme of government.</p>
         <p>[27] In the present case we therefore are presented only with "implied" causes of
            action, and we need not address directly the immunity question as it would arise if
            Congress expressly had created a damages action against the President of the United
            States. This approach accords with this Court's settled policy of avoiding unnecessary
            decision of constitutional issues. Reviewing this case under the "collateral order"
            doctrine, see supra, at 742, we assume for purposes of this opinion that private causes
            of action may be inferred both under the First Amendment and the two statutes on which
            respondent relies. But it does not follow that we must &#x97; in considering a Bivens
            (Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971)) remedy or
            interpreting a statute in light of the immunity doctrine &#x97; assume that the cause of
            action runs against the President of the United States. Cf. Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.
            S. 367, 376 (1951) (construing § 1983 in light of the immunity doctrine, the Court could
            not accept "that Congress . . . would impinge on a tradition [of legislative immunity]
            so well grounded in history and reason by covert inclusion in the general language
            before us," and therefore would not address issues that would arise if Congress had
            undertaken to deprive state legislators of absolute immunity). Consequently, our holding
            today need only be that the President is absolutely immune from civil damages liability
            for his official acts in the absence of explicit affirmative action by Congress. We
            decide only this constitutional issue, which is necessary to disposition of the case
            before us.</p>

         <p>[31] Noting that the Speech and Debate Clause provides a textual basis for congressional
            immunity, respondent argues that the Framers must be assumed to have rejected any
            similar grant of executive immunity. This argument is unpersuasive. First, a specific
            textual basis has not been considered a prerequisite to the recognition of immunity. No
            provision expressly confers judicial immunity. Yet the immunity of judges is well
            settled. See, e. g., Bradley v. Fisher, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/sij/bradley-v-fisher/">

            </span> (1872); Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U. S. 349 (1978). Second, this Court already has
            established that absolute immunity may be extended to certain officials of the Executive
            Branch. Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S., at 511-512; see Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409
            (1976) (extending immunity to prosecutorial officials within the Executive Branch).
            Third, there is historical evidence from which it may be inferred that the Framers
            assumed the President's immunity from damages liability. At the Constitutional
            Convention several delegates expressed concern that subjecting the President even to
            impeachment would impair his capacity to perform his duties of office. See 2 M. Farrand,
            Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 64 (1911) (remarks of Gouverneur Morris);
            id., at 66 (remarks of Charles Pinckney). The delegates of course did agree to an
            Impeachment Clause. But nothing in their debates suggests an expectation that the
            President would be subjected to the distraction of suits by disappointed private
            citizens. And Senator Maclay has recorded the views of Senator Ellsworth and Vice
            President John Adams &#x97; both delegates to the Convention &#x97; that "the President,
            personally, was not the subject to any process whatever . . . . For [that] would . . .
            put it in the power of a common justice to exercise any authority over him and stop the
            whole machine of Government." Journal of William Maclay 167 (E. Maclay ed. 1890).
            Justice Story, writing in 1833, held it implicit in the separation of powers that the
            President must be permitted to discharge his duties undistracted by private lawsuits. 3

            ed. 1833) (quoted supra, at 749). Thomas Jefferson also argued that the President was
            not intended to be subject to judicial process. When Chief Justice Marshall held in
            United States v. Burr, <span class="citation">

            </span> (No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807), that a subpoena duces tecum can be issued to a
            President, Jefferson protested strongly, and stated his broader view of the proper
            relationship between the Judiciary and the President: </p>
         <p>"The leading principle of our Constitution is the independence of the Legislature,
            executive and judiciary of each other, and none are more jealous of this than the
            judiciary. But would the executive be independent of the judiciary, if he were subject
            to the commands of the latter, &amp;amp; to imprisonment for disobedience; if the
            several courts could bandy him from pillar to post, keep him constantly trudging from
            north to south &amp;amp; east to west, and withdraw him entirely from his constitutional
            duties? The intention of the Constitution, that each branch should be independent of the
            others, is further manifested by the means it has furnished to each, to protect itself
            from enterprises of force attempted on them by the others, and to none has it given more
            effectual or diversified means than to the executive." 10 The Works of Thomas Jefferson
            404 n. (P. Ford ed. 1905) (quoting a letter from President Jefferson to a prosecutor at
            the Burr trial) (emphasis in the original).</p>
         <p>See also 5 D. Malone, Jefferson and His Time: Jefferson the President 320-325
            (1974).</p>
         <p>In light of the fragmentary character of the most important materials reflecting the
            Framers' intent, we do think that the most compelling arguments arise from the
            Constitution's separation of powers and the Judiciary's historic understanding of that
            doctrine. See text supra. But our primary reliance on constitutional structure and
            judicial precedent should not be misunderstood. The best historical evidence clearly
            supports the Presidential immunity we have upheld. JUSTICE WHITE'S dissent cites some
            other materials, including ambiguous comments made at state ratifying conventions and
            the remarks of a single publicist. But historical evidence must be weighed as well as
            cited. When the weight of evidence is considered, we think we must place our reliance on
            the contemporary understanding of John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Oliver Ellsworth.
            Other powerful support derives from the actual history of private lawsuits against the
            President. Prior to the litigation explosion commencing with this Court's 1971 Bivens
            decision, fewer than a handful of damages actions ever were filed against the President.
            None appears to have proceeded to judgment on the merits.</p>
         <p>[32] Among the most persuasive reasons supporting official immunity is the prospect that
            damages liability may render an official unduly cautions in the discharge of his
            official duties. As Judge Learned Hand wrote in Gregoire v. Biddle, 177 F. 2d 579, 581
            (CA2 1949), cert. denied, 339 U. S. 949 (1950), "[t]he justification for . . . [denying
            recovery] is that it is impossible to know whether the claim is well founded until the
            case has been tried, and to submit all officials, the innocent as well as the guilty, to
            the burden of a trial and to the inevitable danger of its outcome, would dampen the
            ardor of all but the most resolute . . . ."</p>
         <p>[33] These dangers are significant even though there is no historical record of numerous
            suits against the President, since a right to sue federal officials for damages for
            constitutional violations was not even recognized until Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed.
            Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971).</p>
         <p>[34] This tradition can be traced far back into our constitutional history. See, e. g.,

         <p>[35] See United States v. Reynolds, 345 U. S. 1, 6-7 (1953) (Secretary of the Air

         <p>[36] Although the President was not a party, the Court enjoined the Secretary of
            Commerce from executing a direct Presidential order. See 343 U. S., at 583.</p>
         <p>[37] The Court has recognized before that there is a lesser public interest in actions
            for civil damages than, for example, in criminal prosecutions. See United States v.
            Gillock, 445 U. S. 360, 371-373 (1980); cf. United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S., at
            711-712, and n. 19 (basing holding on special importance of evidence in a criminal trial
            and distinguishing civil actions as raising different questions not presented for
            decision). It never has been denied that absolute immunity may impose a regrettable cost
            on individuals whose rights have been violated. But, contrary to the suggestion of
            JUSTICE WHITE'S dissent, it is not true that our jurisprudence ordinarily supplies a
            remedy in civil damages for every legal wrong. The dissent's objections on this ground
            would weigh equally against absolute immunity for any official. Yet the dissent makes no
            attack on the absolute immunity recognized for judges and prosecutors. </p>
         <p>Our implied-rights-of-action cases identify another area of the law in which there is
            not a damages remedy for every legal wrong. These cases establish that victims of
            statutory crimes ordinarily may not sue in federal court in the absence of expressed
            congressional intent to provide a damages remedy. See, e. g., Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
            Fenner &amp;amp; Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U. S. 353 (1982); Middlesex County Sewerage
            Auth. v. National Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U. S. 1 (1981); California v. Sierra Club, 451
            U. S. 287 (1981). JUSTICE WHITE does not refer to the jurisprudence of implied rights of
            action. Moreover, the dissent undertakes no discussion of cases in the Bivens line in
            which this Court has suggested that there would be no damages relief in circumstances
            "counseling hesitation" by the judiciary. See Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics
            Agents, supra, at 396; Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S. 14, 19 (1980) (in direct
            constitutional actions against officials with "independent status in our constitutional
            scheme. . . judicially created remedies . . . might be inappropriate").</p>
         <p>Even the case on which JUSTICE WHITE places principal reliance, Marbury v. Madison, 1
            Cranch 137 (1803), provides dubious support at best. The dissent cites Marbury for the
            proposition that "[t]he very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of
            every individual to claim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury."
            Id., at 163. Yet Marbury does not establish that the individual's protection must come
            in the form of a particular remedy. Marbury, it should be remembered, lost his case in
            the Supreme Court. The Court turned him away with the suggestion that he should have
            gone elsewhere with his claim. In this case it was clear at least that Fitzgerald was
            entitled to seek a remedy before the Civil Service Commission &#x97; a remedy of which
            he availed himself. See supra, at 736-739, and n. 17.</p>
         <p>[38] The presence of alternative remedies has played an important role in our previous
            decisions in the area of official immunity. E. g., Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S., at
            428-429 ("We emphasize that the immunity of prosecutors from liability in suits under §
            1983 does not leave the public powerless to deter misconduct or to punish that which
            occurs").</p>
         <p>[39] The same remedy plays a central role with respect to the misconduct of federal
            judges, who also possess absolute immunity. See Kaufman, Chilling Judicial Independence,
            88 Yale L. J. 681, 690-706 (1979). Congressmen may be removed from office by a vote of
            their colleagues. U. S. Const., Art. I, § 5, cl. 2.</p>
         <p>[40] Prior to petitioner Nixon's resignation from office, the House Judiciary Committee
            had convened impeachment hearings. See generally Report of the Committee on the
            Judiciary of the House of Representatives: Impeachment of Richard M. Nixon, President of
            the United States, H. R. Rep. No. 93-1305 (1974).</p>
         <p>[41] The dissenting opinions argue that our decision places the President "above the
            law." This contention is rhetorically chilling but wholly unjustified. The remedy of
            impeachment demonstrates that the President remains accountable under law for his
            misdeeds in office. This case involves only a damages remedy. Although the President is
            not liable in civil damages for official misbehavior, that does not lift him "above" the
            law. The dissents do not suggest that a judge is "above" the law when he enters a
            judgment for which he cannot be held answerable in civil damages; or a prosecutor is
            above the law when he files an indictment; or a Congressman is above the law when he
            engages in legislative speech or debate. It is simply error to characterize an official
            as "above the law" because a particular remedy is not available against him.</p>
         <p>[1] Presidential immunity for official acts while in office has never been seriously
            questioned until very recently. Ante, at 750-752, n. 31. I can find only one instance in
            which, prior to our decision in Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S.
            388 (1971), a citizen sued a former President for acts committed while in office. A suit
            against Thomas Jefferson was dismissed for being improperly brought in Virginia, thus
            precluding the necessity of reaching any immunity issue. Livingston v. Jefferson, <span
               class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">15</span>
               <span class="reporter">F. Cas.</span>
               <span class="page">660</span>
            </span> (No. 8,411) (CC Va. 1811).</p>
         <p>[2] In their "parade of horribles" and lamentations, the dissents also wholly fail to
            acknowledge why the same perils they fear are not present in the absolute immunity the
            law has long recognized for numerous other officials. At least 75,000 public officers
            have absolute immunity from civil damages suits for acts within the scope of their
            official functions. The dissenting opinions manifest an astonishing blind side in
            pointing to that old reliable that "no man is above the law." The Court has had no
            difficulty expanding the absolute immunity of Members of Congress, and in granting
            derivative absolute immunity to numerous aides of Members. Gravel v. United States, 408
            U. S. 606 (1972). </p>
         <p>We have since recognized absolute immunity for judges, Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U. S. 349
            (1978), and for prosecutors, Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409 (1976), yet the
            Constitution provides no hint that either judges, prosecutors, or congressional aides
            should be so protected. Absolute immunity for judges and prosecutors is seen to derive
            from the common law and public policy, which recognize the need to protect judges and
            prosecutors from harassment. The potential danger to the citizenry from the malice of
            thousands of prosecutors and judges is at once more pervasive and less open to constant,
            public scrutiny than the actions of a President.</p>
         <p>[3] In United States v. Brewster, 408 U. S. 501 (1972), we held that the Speech and
            Debate Clause does not prohibit prosecution of a Senator for accepting a bribe designed
            to influence his legislative acts.</p>
         <p>[4] JUSTICE WHITE suggests that prior to today, Presidents, prosecutors, judges,
            congressional aides, and other officials "could have been held liable for the kind of
            claim put forward by Fitzgerald &#x97; a personnel decision allegedly made for unlawful
            reasons." Post, at 767, n. 2 (emphasis added). But the law does not permit a plaintiff
            to recite "magic" words in pleadings and have the incantation operate to make these
            immunities vanish. JUSTICE WHITE errs fundamentally in treating all of the above
            officials as if the scope of their authority were identical. The authority of a
            President as head of the Executive Branch of our Government &#x97; a wholly unique
            office &#x97; is far broader than that of any other official. As the Court notes, a
            President has authority in the course of personnel changes in an executive department to
            make personnel decisions. If the decision is wrong, statutory remedies are provided. See
            n. 5, infra. This is not to say that, in a given case, it would not be appropriate to
            raise the question whether an official &#x97; even a President &#x97; had acted within
            the scope of the official's constitutional and statutory duties. The doctrine of
            absolute immunity does not extend beyond such actions.</p>
         <p>[5] Gravel v. United States, 408 U. S. 606 (1972). The Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946
            reflects this policy distinction; in it Congress waived sovereign immunity for certain
            damages claims, but pointedly excepted any "discretionary function or duty . . . whether
            or not the discretion involved be abused." 28 U. S. C. § 2680(a). Under the Act, damage
            resulting from discretionary governmental action is not subject to compensation. See, e.
            g., Dalehite v. United States, 346 U. S. 15 (1953). For uncompensated injuries Congress
            may in its discretion provide separate nonjudicial remedies such as private bills. </p>
         <p>In this case Fitzgerald received substantial relief through the route provided by
            Congress: the Civil Service Commission ordered him reinstated with backpay. App.
            87a-88a. Similarly situated persons are therefore not without an adequate remedy. But
            see post, at 797 (WHITE, J., dissenting). In addition, respondent Fitzgerald has also
            received a settlement of $142,000. It can hardly be said he has had no remedy.</p>
         <p>[6] Judge Learned Hand described his feelings: </p>
         <p>"After now some dozen years of experience I must say that as a litigant I should dread a
            lawsuit beyond almost anything else short of sickness and death." 3 Lectures on Legal
            Topics, Association of the Bar of the City of New York 105 (1926).</p>
         <p>[7] The Court suggests that "we need not address directly" whether Congress could create
            a damages action against a President. Ante, at 748, n. 27. However, the Court's holding,
            in my view, effectively resolves that issue; once it is established that the
            Constitution confers absolute immunity, as the Court holds today, legislative action
            cannot alter that result. Nothing in the Court's opinion is to be read as suggesting
            that a constitutional holding of this Court can be legislatively overruled or modified.
            Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803).</p>
         <p>[1] This, of course, is not simply a hypothetical example. See Halperin v. Kissinger,
            196 U. S. App. D. C. 285, 606 F. 2d 1192 (1979), aff'd by an equally divided Court, 452
            U. S. 713 (1981).</p>
         <p>[2] It is ironic that this decision should come out at the time of the tenth anniversary
            of the Watergate affair. Even the popular press has drawn from that affair an insight
            into the character of the American constitutional system that is bound to be profoundly
            shaken by today's decision: "The important lesson that Watergate established is that no
            President is above the law. It is a banality, a cliche, but it is a point on which many
            Americans. . . seem confused." 119 Time, No. 24, p. 28 (June 14, 1982). A majority of
            the Court shares this confusion. </p>
         <p>The majority vigorously protests this characterization of its position, ante, at 758, n.
            41, arguing that the President remains subject to law in the form of impeachment
            proceedings. But the abandonment of the rule of law here is not in the result reached,
            but in the manner of reaching it. The majority fails to apply to the President those
            principles which we have consistently used to determine the scope and credibility of an
            absolute immunity defense. It does this because of some preconceived notion of the
            inapplicability of general rules of law to the President.</p>
         <p>Similarly, THE CHIEF JUSTICE, like the majority, misses the point in his wholly
            unconvincing contentions that the Court today does no more than extend to the President
            the same sort of immunity that we have recognized with respect to Members of Congress,
            judges, prosecutors, and legislative aides. In none of our previous cases have we
            extended absolute immunity to all actions "within the scope of the official's
            constitutional and statutory duties." Concurring opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE, ante, at
            761, n. 4. Indeed, under the immunity doctrine as it existed prior to today's decision,
            each of these officials could have been held liable for the kind of claim put forward by
            Fitzgerald &#x97; a personnel decision allegedly made for unlawful reasons. Although
            such a decision falls within the scope of an official's duties, it does not fall within
            the judicial, legislative, or prosecutorial functions to which absolute immunity
            attaches. THE CHIEF JUSTICE's failure to grasp the difference between the functional
            approach to absolute immunity that we have previously adopted and the nature of today's
            decision accounts for his misunderstanding of this dissent.</p>
         <p>[3] Although the majority opinion initially claims that its conclusion is based
            substantially on "our history," historical analysis in fact plays virtually no part in
            the analysis that follows.</p>
         <p>[4] On this point, I am in agreement with the concurring opinion of THE CHIEF
            JUSTICE.</p>
         <p>[5] The Solicitor General relies entirely upon the brief filed by his office for
            petitioners in Kissinger v. Halperin, 452 U. S. 713 (1981).</p>
         <p>[6] In fact, insofar as the Constitution addresses the issue of Presidential liability,
            its approach is very different from that taken in the Speech or Debate Clause. The
            possibility of impeachment assures that the President can be held accountable to the
            other branches of Government for his actions; the Constitution further states that
            impeachment does not bar criminal prosecution.</p>
         <p>[7] The debate is recorded in 2 M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787,
            pp. 64-69 (1911) (hereinafter Farrand).</p>
         <p>[8] Id., at 64.</p>
         <p>[9] Id., at 65.</p>
         <p>[10] Ibid.</p>
         <p>[11] Id., at 66.</p>
         <p>[12] In The <ref type="" num="65">Federalist</ref> No. 65, p. 439 (J. Cooke ed. 1961), Alexander Hamilton described
            impeachable offenses as follows: "They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety
            be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the
            society itself."</p>
         <p>[13] The majority's use of the historical record is in line with its other arguments: It
            puts the burden on respondent to demonstrate no Presidential immunity, rather than on
            petitioner to prove the appropriateness of this defense. Thus, while noting that the
            doubts of some of the Framers were not sufficient to prevent the adoption of the
            Impeachment Clause, the majority nevertheless states that "nothing in [the] debates
            suggests an expectation that the President would be subjected to [civil damages
            actions]." Ante, at 751, n. 31. Of course, nothing in the debates suggests an
            expectation that the President would not be liable in civil suits for damages either.
            Nevertheless, the debates are one element that the majority cites to support its
            conclusion that "[t]he best historical evidence clearly supports the Presidential
            immunity we have upheld." Ante, at 752, n. 31.</p>
         <p>[14] Other commentary on the proposed Constitution did, however, consider the subject of
            Presidential immunity. In fact, the subject was discussed in the first major defense of
            the Constitution published in the United States. In his essays on the Constitution,
            published in the Independent Gazetteer in September 1787, Tench Coxe included the
            following statement in his description of the limited power of the proposed Office of
            the President: "His person is not so much protected as that of a member of the House of
            Representatives; for he may be proceeded against like any other man in the ordinary
            course of law." Quoted in 2 The Documentary History of the Ratification of the
            Constitution 141 (1976) (emphasis in original).</p>

         <p>[21] It is not possible to determine whether this is the same Pinckney that Madison
            recorded as Pinkney, who objected at the Convention to granting a power of impeachment
            to the Legislature. Two Charles Pinckneys attended the Convention. Both were from South
            Carolina. See 3 Farrand 559.</p>
         <p>[22] Senator Pinckney's comments are recorded at 10 Annals of Cong. 69-83 (1800).
            Petitioner contends that these remarks are not relevant because they concerned only the
            authority of Congress to inquire into the origin of an allegedly libelous newspaper
            article. Reply Brief for Petitioner 7. Although this was the occasion for the remarks,
            Pinckney did discuss the immunity of Members of Congress as a privilege embodied in the
            Speech or Debate Clause: "[O]ur Constitution supposes no man . . . to be infallible, but
            considers them all as mere men, and subject to all the passions, and frailties, and
            crimes, that men generally are, and accordingly provides for the trial of such as ought
            to be tried, and leaves the members of the Legislature, for their proceedings, to be
            amenable to their constituents and to public opinion . . . ." 10 Annals of Cong. 71
            (1800). This, then, was one of the privileges of Congress that he was contrasting with
            those extended (or not extended) to the President.</p>
         <p>[23] The majority cites one additional piece of historical evidence, a letter by
            President Jefferson, which it contends demonstrates that Jefferson believed that "the
            President was not intended to be subject to judicial process." Ante, at 751, n. 31. </p>
         <p>Thomas Jefferson's views on the relation of the President to the judicial process are,
            however, not quite so clear as the majority suggests. Jefferson took a variety of
            positions on the proper relation of Executive and Judicial authority, at different
            points in his career. It would be surprising if President Jefferson had not argued
            strongly for such immunity from judicial process, particularly in a confrontation with
            Chief Justice Marshall. Jefferson's views on this issue before he became President would
            be of a good deal more significance. In this regard, it is significant that in
            Jefferson's second and third drafts of the Virginia Constitution, which also proposed a
            separation of the powers of government into three separate branches, he specifically
            proposed that the Executive be subject to judicial process: "[H]e shall be liable to
            action, tho' not to personal restraint for private duties or wrongs." 1 Papers of Thomas
            Jefferson 350, 360 (1950). Also significant is the fact that when Jefferson's followers
            tried to impeach Justice Chase in 1804-1805, one of the grounds of their attack on him
            was that he had refused to subpoena President Adams during the trial of Dr. Cooper for
            sedition. See E. Corwin, The President: Office and Powers 113 (4th ed. 1957). Finally,
            it is worth noting that even in the middle of the debate over Chief Justice Marshall's
            power to subpoena the President during the Burr trial, Jefferson looked to a legislative
            solution of the confrontation: "I hope however that . . . at the ensuing session of the
            legislature [the Chief Justice] may have means provided for giving to individuals the
            benefit of the testimony of the [Executive] functionaries in proper cases." 10 The Works
            of Thomas Jefferson 407 n. (P. Ford ed. 1905) (quoting a letter from President Jefferson
            to George Hay, United States District Attorney for Virginia).</p>
         <p>[24] The Solicitor General, in fact, argues that the possibility of judicial review of
            Presidential actions supports the claim of absolute immunity: Judicial review "serves to
            contain and correct the unauthorized exercise of the President's powers," making private
            damages actions unnecessary in order to achieve the same end. Brief for Petitioners in
            Kissinger v. Halperin, O. T. 1980, No. 79-880, p. 31. See n. 5, supra.</p>
         <p>[25] See also Justice Harlan's discussion of the appropriateness of the damages remedy
            in order to redress the violation of certain constitutional rights. Bivens v. Six
            Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S., at 407-410 (concurring in judgment).</p>
         <p>[26] Contrary to the suggestion of the majority, ante, at 754-755, n. 37, I do not
            suggest that there must always be a remedy in civil damages for every legal wrong or
            that Marbury v. Madison stands for this proposition. Marbury does, however, suggest the
            importance of the private interests at stake within the broader perspective of a
            political system based on the rule of law. The functional approach to immunity
            questions, which we have previously followed but which the majority today discards,
            represented an appropriate reconciliation of the conflicting interests at stake.</p>
         <p>[27] The Court has never held that the "public policy" conclusions it reaches as to the
            appropriateness of absolute immunity in particular instances are not subject to reversal
            through congressional action. Implicitly, therefore, the Court has already rejected a
            constitutionally based, separation-of-powers argument for immunity for federal
            officials.</p>
         <p>[28] Surely the fact that officers of the court have been the primary beneficiaries of
            this Court's pronouncements of absolute immunity gives support to this appearance of
            favoritism.</p>
         <p>[29] See Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union of United States, 446 U. S. 719
            (1980); Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478, 511 (1978).</p>
         <p>[30] I will not speculate on the Presidential functions which may require absolute
            immunity, but a clear example would be instances in which the President participates in
            prosecutorial decisions.</p>
         <p>[31] See, e. g., 48 Cong. Rec. 4653 (1912) ("During my first session of Congress I was
            desirous of learning the needs of the postal service and inquiring into the conditions
            of the employees. To my surprise I found that under an Executive order these
            civil-service employees could not give me any information") (remarks of Rep. Calder);
            id., at 4656 ("I believe it is high time that Congress should listen to the appeals of
            these men and provide a way whereby they can properly present a petition to the Members
            of Congress for a redress of grievances without the fear of losing their official
            positions") (remarks of Rep. Reilly); id., at 5157 ("I have always requested employees
            to consult with me on matters affecting their interest and believe that it is my duty to
            listen to all respectful appeals and complaints") (remarks of Rep. Evans). Indeed, it is
            for just this reason that petitioners in Harlow v. Fitzgerald, post, p. 800, argue that
            the statutes do not create a private right of action: "5 U. S. C. § 7211 and 18 U. S. C.
            § 1505 were designed to protect the legislative process, not to give one such as
            Fitzgerald a right to seek damages." Brief for Petitioners, O. T. 1981, No. 80-945, p.
            26, n. 11.</p>
         <p>[32] Indeed, the impetus for passage of what is now 5 U. S. C. § 7211 (1976 ed., Supp.
            IV) was the imposition of "gag rules" upon testimony of civil servants before
            congressional committees. See Exec. Order No. 402 (Jan. 25, 1906); Exec. Order No. 1142
            (Nov. 26, 1909).</p>
         <p>[33] Thus, adverse action may generally be taken against civil servants only "for such
            cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." 5 U. S. C. §§ 7503, 7513, and 7543
            (1976 ed., Supp. IV).</p>
         <p>[34] The majority also seems to believe that by "function" the Court has in the past
            referred to "subjective purpose." See ante, at 756 ("an inquiry into the President's
            motives could not be avoided under the . . . `functional' theory . . ."). I do not read
            our cases that way. In Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U. S. 349, 362 (1978), we held that the
            factors determining whether a judge's act was a "judicial action" entitled to absolute
            immunity "relate to the nature of the act itself, i. e., whether it is a function
            normally performed by a judge, and to the expectations of the parties." Neither of these
            factors required any analysis of the purpose the judge may have had in carrying out the
            particular action. Similarly in Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S., at 512-516, when we
            determined that certain executive functions were entitled to absolute immunity because
            they shared "enough of the characteristics of the judicial process," we looked to
            objective qualities and not subjective purpose.</p>
         <p>[35] The majority seems to suggest that responsibility for governmental reorganizations
            is one such function. Ante, at 756. I fail to see why this should be so.</p>
         <p>[36] Although our conclusions differ, the majority opinion reflects a similar view as to
            the relationship between the two sources of the causes of action in this case: It does
            not believe it necessary to differentiate in its own analysis between the statutory and
            constitutional causes of action.</p>
         <p>[37] THE CHIEF JUSTICE leaves no doubt that he, at least, reads the majority opinion as
            standing for the broad proposition that the President is absolutely immune under the
            Constitution: </p>
         <p>"I write separately to underscore that the Presidential immunity [as spelled out today]
            derives from and is mandated by the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers."
            Concurring opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE, ante, at 758.</p>
         <p>Similarly, THE CHIEF JUSTICE dismisses the majority's claim that it has not decided the
            question of whether Congress could create a damages action against the President: "[T]he
            Court's holding . . . effectively resolves that issue; once it is established that the
            Constitution confers absolute immunity, as the Court holds today, legislative action
            cannot alter that result." Ante, at 763, n. 7.</p>
         <p>[38] Contrary to the suggestion of the majority, Mississippi v. Johnson, <span
               class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">4</span>
               <span class="reporter">Wall.</span>
               <span class="page">475</span>
            </span> (1866), carefully reserved the question of whether a court may compel the
            President himself to perform ministerial executive functions: "We shall limit our
            inquiry to the question presented by the objection, without expressing any opinion on
            the broader issues . . . whether, in any case, the President . . . may be required, by
            the process of this court, to perform a purely ministerial act under a positive law, or
            may be held amenable, in any case, otherwise than by impeachment for crime." Id., at
            498. Similarly, Kendall v. United States, <span class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">12</span>
               <span class="reporter">Pet.</span>
               <span class="page">524</span>
            </span> (1838), also cited by the majority, did not indicate that the President could
            never be subject to judicial process. In fact, it implied just the contrary in rejecting
            the argument that the mandamus sought involved an unconstitutional judicial infringement
            upon the Executive Branch: </p>
         <p>"The mandamus does not seek to direct or control the postmaster general in the discharge
            of any official duty, partaking in any respect of an executive character; but to enforce
            the performance of a mere ministerial act, which neither he nor the President had any
            authority to deny or control." Id., at 610.</p>
         <p>[1] "No man in this country is so high that he is above the law. No officer of the law
            may set that law at defiance with impunity. All the officers of the government, from the
            highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law, and are bound to obey it."</p>
         <p>[2] "The very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every
            individual to claim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury. One of
            the first duties of government is to afford that protection. In Great Britain the king
            himself is sued in the respectful form of a petition, and he never fails to comply with
            the judgment of his court."</p>
         <p>[3] The agreement in Havens was not final until approved by the District Court, 455 U.
            S., at 370-371. In the present case, the parties made their agreement and presented it
            to the District Court only after the fact. Further, there was no preliminary payment in
            Havens. Each respondent there was to receive $400 if the Court denied certiorari or
            affirmed, and nothing if the Court reversed. Here, $142,000 changed hands regardless of
            the subsequent disposition of the case, with the much smaller sum of $28,000 resting on
            the Court's ultimate ruling. For me, this is not the kind of case or controversy
            contemplated by Art. III of the Constitution.</p>
