         <p>JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
         <p>Petitioner Michael Crawford stabbed a man who allegedly tried to rape his wife, Sylvia.
            At his trial, the State played for the jury Sylvia's tape-recorded statement to the
            police describing the stabbing, even though he had no opportunity for cross-examination.
            The Washington Supreme Court upheld petitioner's conviction after determining that
            Sylvia's statement was reliable. The question presented is whether this procedure
            complied with the Sixth Amendment's guarantee that, "[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the
            accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against
            him."</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>On August 5, 1999, Kenneth Lee was stabbed at his apartment. Police arrested petitioner
            later that night. After giving petitioner and his wife Miranda warnings, detectives
            interrogated each of them twice. Petitioner eventually confessed that he and Sylvia had
            gone in search of Lee because he was upset over an earlier incident in which Lee had
            tried to rape her. The two had found Lee at his apartment, and a fight ensued in which
            Lee was stabbed in the torso and petitioner's hand was cut.</p>
         <p>Petitioner gave the following account of the fight:</p> "Q. Okay. Did you ever see
         anything in [Lee's] hands? "A. I think so, but I'm not positive. "Q. Okay, when you think
         so, what do you mean by that? "A. I could a swore I seen him goin' for somethin' before,
         right before everything happened. He was like <span class="star-pagination">*39</span>
         reachin', fiddlin' around down here and stuff . . . and I just . . . I don't know, I think,
         this is just a possibility, but I think, I think that he pulled somethin' out and I grabbed
         for it and that's how I got cut . . . but I'm not positive. I, I, my mind goes blank when
         things like this happen. I mean, I just, I remember things wrong, I remember things that
         just doesn't, don't make sense to me later." App. 155 (punctuation added). <p>Sylvia
            generally corroborated petitioner's story about the events leading up to the fight, but
            her account of the fight itself was arguably different &#x97; particularly with respect
            to whether Lee had drawn a weapon before petitioner assaulted him:</p> "Q. Did Kenny do
         anything to fight back from this assault? "A. (pausing) I know he reached into his pocket .
         . . or somethin' . . . I don't know what. "Q. After he was stabbed? "A. He saw Michael
         coming up. He lifted his hand . . . his chest open, he might [have] went to go strike his
         hand out or something and then (inaudible). "Q. Okay, you, you gotta speak up. "A. Okay, he
         lifted his hand over his head maybe to strike Michael's hand down or something and then he
         put his hands in his . . . put his right hand in his right pocket . . . took a step back .
         . . Michael proceeded to stab him . . . then his hands were like . . . how do you explain
         this . . . open arms . . . with his hands open and he fell down . . . and we ran
         (describing subject holding hands open, palms toward assailant). "Q. Okay, when he's
         standing there with his open hands, you're talking about Kenny, correct? "A. Yeah, after,
         after the fact, yes. "Q. Did you see anything in his hands at that point? <span
            class="star-pagination">*40</span> "A. (pausing) um um (no)." Id., at 137 (punctuation
         added). <p>The State charged petitioner with assault and attempted murder. At trial, he
            claimed self-defense. Sylvia did not testify because of the state marital privilege,
            which generally bars a spouse from testifying without the other spouse's consent. See
            Wash. Rev. Code § 5.60.060(1) (1994). In Washington, this privilege does not extend to a
            spouse's out-of-court statements admissible under a hearsay exception, see State v.
            Burden, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/wash/7kuW/state-v-burden/">

               </a>
            </span>, 377, 841 P. 2d 758, 761 (1992), so the State sought to introduce Sylvia's
            tape-recorded statements to the police as evidence that the stabbing was not in
            self-defense. Noting that Sylvia had admitted she led petitioner to Lee's apartment and
            thus had facilitated the assault, the State invoked the hearsay exception for statements
            against penal interest, Wash. Rule Evid. 804(b)(3) (2003).</p>
         <p>Petitioner countered that, state law notwithstanding, admitting the evidence would
            violate his federal constitutional right to be "confronted with the witnesses against
            him." Amdt. 6. According to our description of that right in Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S.
            56 (1980), it does not bar admission of an unavailable witness's statement against a
            criminal defendant if the statement bears "adequate `indicia of reliability.'" Id., at
            66. To meet that test, evidence must either fall within a "firmly rooted hearsay
            exception" or bear "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness." Ibid. The trial court
            here admitted the statement on the latter ground, offering several reasons why it was
            trustworthy: Sylvia was not shifting blame but rather corroborating her husband's story
            that he acted in self-defense or "justified reprisal"; she had direct knowledge as an
            eyewitness; she was describing recent events; and she was being questioned by a
            "neutral" law enforcement officer. App. 76-77. The prosecution played the tape for the
            jury and relied on it in closing, arguing that it was "damning evidence" that
            "completely <span class="star-pagination">*41</span> refutes [petitioner's] claim of
            self-defense." Tr. 468 (Oct. 21, 1999). The jury convicted petitioner of assault.</p>
         <p>The Washington Court of Appeals reversed. It applied a nine-factor test to determine
            whether Sylvia's statement bore particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, and noted
            several reasons why it did not: The statement contradicted one she had previously given;
            it was made in response to specific questions; and at one point she admitted she had
            shut her eyes during the stabbing. The court considered and rejected the State's
            argument that Sylvia's statement was reliable because it coincided with petitioner's to
            such a degree that the two "interlocked." The court determined that, although the two
            statements agreed about the events leading up to the stabbing, they differed on the
            issue crucial to petitioner's self-defense claim: "[Petitioner's] version asserts that
            Lee may have had something in his hand when he stabbed him; but Sylvia's version has Lee
            grabbing for something only after he has been stabbed." App. 32.</p>
         <p>The Washington Supreme Court reinstated the conviction, unanimously concluding that,
            although Sylvia's statement did not fall under a firmly rooted hearsay exception, it
            bore guarantees of trustworthiness: "`[W]hen a codefendant's confession is virtually
            identical [to, i. e., interlocks with,] that of a defendant, it may be deemed
            reliable.'" <span class="citation no-link">

         of Appeals concluded that the statements were contradictory, upon closer inspection they
         appear to overlap. . . . "[B]oth of the Crawfords' statements indicate that Lee was
         possibly grabbing for a weapon, but they are equally unsure when this event may have taken
         place. They are also equally unsure how Michael received the cut on his hand, leading the
         court to question when, if ever, Lee possessed a weapon. In this respect they overlap. . .
         . <span class="star-pagination">*42</span> "[N]either Michael nor Sylvia clearly stated
         that Lee had a weapon in hand from which Michael was simply defending himself. And it is
         this omission by both that interlocks the statements and makes Sylvia's statement
         reliable." 147 Wash. 2d, at 438-439, 54 P. 3d, at 664 (internal quotation marks
            omitted).<span class="sup">[1]</span>
         <p>We granted certiorari to determine whether the State's use of Sylvia's statement
            violated the Confrontation Clause. 539 U. S. 914 (2003).</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>The Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause provides that, "[i]n all criminal
            prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the
            witnesses against him." We have held that this bedrock procedural guarantee applies to
            both federal and state prosecutions. Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 406 (1965). As
            noted above, Roberts says that an unavailable witness's out-of-court statement may be
            admitted so long as it has adequate indicia of reliability &#x97; i. e., falls within a
            "firmly rooted hearsay exception" or bears "particularized guarantees of
            trustworthiness." 448 U. S., at 66. Petitioner argues that this test strays from the
            original meaning of the Confrontation Clause and urges us to reconsider it.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>The Constitution's text does not alone resolve this case. One could plausibly read
            "witnesses against" a defendant to <span class="star-pagination">*43</span> mean those
            who actually testify at trial, cf. Woodsides v. State, <span class="citation no-link">

            </span>, 664-665 (1837), those whose statements are offered at trial, see 3 J. Wigmore,
            Evidence § 1397, p. 104 (2d ed. 1923) (hereinafter Wigmore), or something in-between,
            see infra, at 52-53. We must therefore turn to the historical background of the Clause
            to understand its meaning.</p>
         <p>The right to confront one's accusers is a concept that dates back to Roman times. See
            Coy v. Iowa, 487 U. S. 1012, 1015 (1988); Herrmann &amp;amp; Speer, Facing the Accuser:
            Ancient and Medieval Precursors of the Confrontation Clause, 34 Va. J. Int'l L. 481
            (1994). The founding generation's immediate source of the concept, however, was the
            common law. English common law has long differed from continental civil law in regard to
            the manner in which witnesses give testimony in criminal trials. The common-law
            tradition is one of live testimony in court subject to adversarial testing, while the
            civil law condones examination in private by judicial officers. See 3 W. Blackstone,
            Commentaries on the Laws of England 373-374 (1768).</p>
         <p>Nonetheless, England at times adopted elements of the civil-law practice. Justices of
            the peace or other officials examined suspects and witnesses before trial. These
            examinations were sometimes read in court in lieu of live testimony, a practice that
            "occasioned frequent demands by the prisoner to have his `accusers,' i. e. the witnesses
            against him, brought before him face to face." 1 J. Stephen, History of the Criminal Law
            of England 326 (1883). In some cases, these demands were refused. See 9 W. Holdsworth,
            History of English Law 216-217, 228 (3d ed. 1944); e. g., Raleigh's Case, 2 How. St. Tr.
            1, 15-16, 24 (1603); Throckmorton's Case, 1 How. St. Tr. 869, 875-876 (1554); cf.
            Lilburn's Case, 3 How. St. Tr. 1315, 1318-1322, 1329 (Star Chamber 1637).</p>
         <p>Pretrial examinations became routine under two statutes passed during the reign of Queen
            Mary in the 16th century, 1 &amp;amp; 2 Phil. &amp;amp; M., c. 13 (1554), and 2
            &amp;amp; 3 id., c. 10 (1555). <span class="star-pagination">*44</span> These Marian
            bail and committal statutes required justices of the peace to examine suspects and
            witnesses in felony cases and to certify the results to the court. It is doubtful that
            the original purpose of the examinations was to produce evidence admissible at trial.
            See J. Langbein, Prosecuting Crime in the Renaissance 21-34 (1974). Whatever the
            original purpose, however, they came to be used as evidence in some cases, see 2 M.
            Hale, Pleas of the Crown 284 (1736), resulting in an adoption of continental procedure.
            See 4 Holdsworth, supra, at 528-530.</p>
         <p>The most notorious instances of civil-law examination occurred in the great political
            trials of the 16th and 17th centuries. One such was the 1603 trial of Sir Walter Raleigh
            for treason. Lord Cobham, Raleigh's alleged accomplice, had implicated him in an
            examination before the Privy Council and in a letter. At Raleigh's trial, these were
            read to the jury. Raleigh argued that Cobham had lied to save himself: "Cobham is
            absolutely in the King's mercy; to excuse me cannot avail him; by accusing me he may
            hope for favour." 1 D. Jardine, Criminal Trials 435 (1832). Suspecting that Cobham would
            recant, Raleigh demanded that the judges call him to appear, arguing that "[t]he Proof
            of the Common Law is by witness and jury: let Cobham be here, let him speak it. Call my
            accuser before my face . . . ." 2 How. St. Tr., at 15-16. The judges refused, id., at
            24, and, despite Raleigh's protestations that he was being tried "by the Spanish
            Inquisition," id., at 15, the jury convicted, and Raleigh was sentenced to death.</p>
         <p>One of Raleigh's trial judges later lamented that "`the justice of England has never
            been so degraded and injured as by the condemnation of Sir Walter Raleigh.'" 1 Jardine,
            supra, at 520. Through a series of statutory and judicial reforms, English law developed
            a right of confrontation that limited these abuses. For example, treason statutes
            required witnesses to confront the accused "face to face" at his arraignment. E. g., 13
            Car. 2, c. 1, § 5 (1661); see 1 Hale, <span class="star-pagination">*45</span> supra, at
            306. Courts, meanwhile, developed relatively strict rules of unavailability, admitting
            examinations only if the witness was demonstrably unable to testify in person. See Lord
            Morley's Case, 6 How. St. Tr. 769, 770-771 (H. L. 1666); 2 Hale, supra, at 284; 1
            Stephen, supra, at 358. Several authorities also stated that a suspect's confession
            could be admitted only against himself, and not against others he implicated. See 2 W.
            Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, ch. 46, § 3, pp. 603-604 (T. Leach 6th ed. 1787); 1 Hale,
            supra, at 585, n. (k); 1 G. Gilbert, Evidence 216 (C. Lofft ed. 1791); cf. Tong's Case,
            Kel. J. 17, 18, 84 Eng. Rep. 1061, 1062 (1662) (treason). But see King v. Westbeer, 1
            Leach 12, 168 Eng. Rep. 108, 109 (1739).</p>
         <p>One recurring question was whether the admissibility of an unavailable witness's
            pretrial examination depended on whether the defendant had had an opportunity to
            cross-examine him. In 1696, the Court of King's Bench answered this question in the
            affirmative, in the widely reported misdemeanor libel case of King v. Paine, 5 Mod. 163,
            87 Eng. Rep. 584. The court ruled that, even though a witness was dead, his examination
            was not admissible where "the defendant not being present when [it was] taken before the
            mayor . . . had lost the benefit of a cross-examination." Id., at 165, 87 Eng. Rep., at
            585. The question was also debated at length during the infamous proceedings against Sir
            John Fenwick on a bill of attainder. Fenwick's counsel objected to admitting the
            examination of a witness who had been spirited away, on the ground that Fenwick had had
            no opportunity to cross-examine. See Fenwick's Case, 13 How. St. Tr. 537, 591-592 (H. C.
            1696) (Powys) ("[T]hat which they would offer is something that Mr. Goodman hath sworn
            when he was examined . . . ; sir J. F. not being present or privy, and no opportunity
            given to cross-examine the person; and I conceive that cannot be offered as evidence . .
            ."); id., at 592 (Shower) ("[N]o deposition of a person can be read, though beyond sea,
            unless in cases where the party it is to be read <span class="star-pagination"
               >*46</span> against was privy to the examination, and might have cross-examined him .
            . . . [O]ur constitution is, that the person shall see his accuser"). The examination
            was nonetheless admitted on a closely divided vote after several of those present opined
            that the common-law rules of procedure did not apply to parliamentary attainder
            proceedings &#x97; one speaker even admitting that the evidence would normally be
            inadmissible. See id., at 603-604 (Williamson); id., at 604-605 (Chancellor of the
            Exchequer); id., at 607; 3 Wigmore § 1364, at 22-23, n. 54. Fenwick was condemned, but
            the proceedings "must have burned into the general consciousness the vital importance of
            the rule securing the right of cross-examination." Id., § 1364, at 22; cf. Carmell v.
            Texas, 529 U. S. 513, 526-530 (2000).</p>
         <p>Paine had settled the rule requiring a prior opportunity for cross-examination as a
            matter of common law, but some doubts remained over whether the Marian statutes
            prescribed an exception to it in felony cases. The statutes did not identify the
            circumstances under which examinations were admissible, see 1 &amp;amp; 2 Phil.
            &amp;amp; M., c. 13 (1554); 2 &amp;amp; 3 id., c. 10 (1555), and some inferred that no
            prior opportunity for cross-examination was required. See Westbeer, supra, at 12, 168
            Eng. Rep., at 109; compare Fenwick's Case, 13 How. St. Tr., at 596 (Sloane), with id.,
            at 602 (Musgrave). Many who expressed this view acknowledged that it meant the statutes
            were in derogation of the common law. See King v. Eriswell, 3 T. R. 707, 710, 100 Eng.

            Force `of the Statute'"), with id., at 65. Nevertheless, by 1791 (the year the Sixth
            Amendment was ratified), courts were applying the cross-examination rule even to
            examinations by justices of the peace in felony cases. See King v. Dingler, 2 Leach 561,
            562-563, 168 Eng. Rep. 383, 383-384 (1791); King v. Woodcock, 1 Leach 500, 502-504, 168

            23. Early 19th-century treatises confirm that requirement. See 1 T. Starkie, Evidence 95
            (1826); 2 id., at 484-492; T. Peake, Evidence 63-64 (3d ed. 1808). When Parliament
            amended the statutes in 1848 to make the requirement explicit, see 11 &amp;amp; 12
            Vict., c. 42, § 17, the change merely "introduced in terms" what was already afforded
            the defendant "by the equitable construction of the law." Queen v. Beeston, 29 Eng. L.

         <p>Controversial examination practices were also used in the Colonies. Early in the 18th
            century, for example, the Virginia Council protested against the Governor for having
            "privately issued several commissions to examine witnesses against particular men ex
            parte," complaining that "the person accused is not admitted to be confronted with, or
            defend himself against his defamers." A Memorial Concerning the Maladministrations of
            His Excellency Francis Nicholson, reprinted in 9 English Historical Documents 253, 257
            (D. Douglas ed. 1955). A decade before the Revolution, England gave jurisdiction over
            Stamp Act offenses to the admiralty courts, which followed civil-law rather than
            common-law <span class="star-pagination">*48</span> procedures and thus routinely took
            testimony by deposition or private judicial examination. See 5 Geo. 3, c. 12, § 57
            (1765); Pollitt, The Right of Confrontation: Its History and Modern Dress, 8 J. Pub. L.
            381, 396-397 (1959). Colonial representatives protested that the Act subverted their
            rights "by extending the jurisdiction of the courts of admiralty beyond its ancient
            limits." Resolutions of the Stamp Act Congress § 8th (Oct. 19, 1765), reprinted in
            Sources of Our Liberties 270, 271 (R. Perry &amp;amp; J. Cooper eds. 1959). John Adams,
            defending a merchant in a high-profile admiralty case, argued: "Examinations of
            witnesses upon Interrogatories, are only by the Civil Law. Interrogatories are unknown
            at common Law, and Englishmen and common Lawyers have an aversion to them if not an
            Abhorrence of them." Draft of Argument in Sewall v. Hancock (Oct. 1768-Mar. 1769), in 2
            Legal Papers of John Adams 194, 207 (L. Wroth &amp;amp; H. Zobel eds. 1965).</p>
         <p>Many declarations of rights adopted around the time of the Revolution guaranteed a right
            of confrontation. See Virginia Declaration of Rights § 8 (1776); Pennsylvania
            Declaration of Rights § IX (1776); Delaware Declaration of Rights § 14 (1776); Maryland
            Declaration of Rights § XIX (1776); North Carolina Declaration of Rights § VII (1776);
            Vermont Declaration of Rights Ch. I, § X (1777); Massachusetts Declaration of Rights §
            XII (1780); New Hampshire Bill of Rights § XV (1783), all reprinted in 1 B. Schwartz,
            The Bill of Rights: A Documentary History 235, 265, 278, 282, 287, 323, 342, 377 (1971).
            The proposed Federal Constitution, however, did not. At the Massachusetts ratifying
            convention, Abraham Holmes objected to this omission precisely on the ground that it
            would lead to civil-law practices: "The mode of trial is altogether indetermined; . . .
            whether [the defendant] is to be allowed to confront the witnesses, and have the
            advantage of cross-examination, we are not yet told. . . . [W]e shall find Congress
            possessed of powers enabling them to institute judicatories little less inauspicious
            than a certain <span class="star-pagination">*49</span> tribunal in Spain, . . . the
            Inquisition." 2 Debates on the Federal Constitution 110-111 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1863).
            Similarly, a prominent Anti<ref type="" num="">Federalist</ref> writing under the pseudonym Federal Farmer
            criticized the use of "written evidence" while objecting to the omission of a vicinage
            right: "Nothing can be more essential than the cross examining [of] witnesses, and
            generally before the triers of the facts in question. . . . [W]ritten evidence . . .
            [is] almost useless; it must be frequently taken ex parte, and but very seldom leads to
            the proper discovery of truth." R. Lee, Letter IV by the Federal Farmer (Oct. 15, 1787),
            reprinted in 1 Schwartz, supra, at 469, 473. The First Congress responded by including
            the Confrontation Clause in the proposal that became the Sixth Amendment.</p>
         <p>Early state decisions shed light upon the original understanding of the common-law
            right. State v. Webb, 2 N. C. 103 (Super. L. &amp;amp; Eq. 1794) (per curiam), decided a
            mere three years after the adoption of the Sixth Amendment, held that depositions could
            be read against an accused only if they were taken in his presence. Rejecting a broader
            reading of the English authorities, the court held: "[I]t is a rule of the common law,
            founded on natural justice, that no man shall be prejudiced by evidence which he had not
            the liberty to cross examine." Id., at 104.</p>
         <p>Similarly, in State v. Campbell, 30 S. C. L. 124 (App. L. 1844), South Carolina's
            highest law court excluded a deposition taken by a coroner in the absence of the
            accused. It held: "[I]f we are to decide the question by the established rules of the
            common law, there could not be a dissenting voice. For, notwithstanding the death of the
            witness, and whatever the respectability of the court taking the depositions, the
            solemnity of the occasion and the weight of the testimony, such depositions are ex
            parte, and, therefore, utterly incompetent." Id., at 125. The court said that one of the
            "indispensable conditions" implicitly guaranteed by the State Constitution was that
            "prosecutions be carried on <span class="star-pagination">*50</span> to the conviction
            of the accused, by witnesses confronted by him, and subjected to his personal
            examination." Ibid.</p>
         <p>Many other decisions are to the same effect. Some early cases went so far as to hold
            that prior testimony was inadmissible in criminal cases even if the accused had a
            previous opportunity to cross-examine. See Finn v. Commonwealth, <span

         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>This history supports two inferences about the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>First, the principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the
            civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of ex parte examinations
            as evidence against the accused. It was these practices that the Crown deployed in
            notorious treason cases like Raleigh's; that the Marian statutes invited; that English
            law's assertion of a right to confrontation was meant to prohibit; and that the
            founding-era rhetoric decried. The Sixth Amendment must be interpreted with this focus
            in mind.</p>
         <p>Accordingly, we once again reject the view that the Confrontation Clause applies of its
            own force only to in-court testimony, and that its application to out-of-court
            statements <span class="star-pagination">*51</span> introduced at trial depends upon
            "the law of Evidence for the time being." 3 Wigmore § 1397, at 101; accord, Dutton v.
            Evans, 400 U. S. 74, 94 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in result). Leaving the
            regulation of out-of-court statements to the law of evidence would render the
            Confrontation Clause powerless to prevent even the most flagrant inquisitorial
            practices. Raleigh was, after all, perfectly free to confront those who read Cobham's
            confession in court.</p>
         <p>This focus also suggests that not all hearsay implicates the Sixth Amendment's core
            concerns. An off-hand, overheard remark might be unreliable evidence and thus a good
            candidate for exclusion under hearsay rules, but it bears little resemblance to the
            civil-law abuses the Confrontation Clause targeted. On the other hand, ex parte
            examinations might sometimes be admissible under modern hearsay rules, but the Framers
            certainly would not have condoned them.</p>
         <p>The text of the Confrontation Clause reflects this focus. It applies to "witnesses"
            against the accused &#x97; in other words, those who "bear testimony." 2 N. Webster, An
            American Dictionary of the English Language (1828). "Testimony," in turn, is typically
            "[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving
            some fact." Ibid. An accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears
            testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does
            not. The constitutional text, like the history underlying the common-law right of
            confrontation, thus reflects an especially acute concern with a specific type of
            out-of-court statement.</p>
         <p>Various formulations of this core class of "testimonial" statements exist: "ex parte
            in-court testimony or its functional equivalent &#x97; that is, material such as
            affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to
            cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to
            be used prosecutorially," Brief for Petitioner 23; "extrajudicial statements . . . <span
               class="star-pagination">*52</span> contained in formalized testimonial materials,
            such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions," White v. Illinois,
            502 U. S. 346, 365 (1992) (THOMAS, J., joined by SCALIA, J., concurring in part and
            concurring in judgment); "statements that were made under circumstances which would lead
            an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use
            at a later trial," Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as
            Amici Curiae 3. These formulations all share a common nucleus and then define the
            Clause's coverage at various levels of abstraction around it. Regardless of the precise
            articulation, some statements qualify under any definition &#x97; for example, ex parte
            testimony at a preliminary hearing.</p>
         <p>Statements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations are also testimonial
            under even a narrow standard. Police interrogations bear a striking resemblance to
            examinations by justices of the peace in England. The statements are not sworn
            testimony, but the absence of oath was not dispositive. Cobham's examination was
            unsworn, see 1 Jardine, Criminal Trials, at 430, yet Raleigh's trial has long been
            thought a paradigmatic confrontation violation, see, e. g., Campbell, 30 S. C. L., at
            130. Under the Marian statutes, witnesses were typically put on oath, but suspects were
            not. See 2 Hale, Pleas of the Crown, at 52. Yet Hawkins and others went out of their way
            to caution that such unsworn confessions were not admissible against anyone but the
            confessor. See supra, at 45.<span class="sup">[3]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*53</span> That interrogators are police officers rather
            than magistrates does not change the picture either. Justices of the peace conducting
            examinations under the Marian statutes were not magistrates as we understand that office
            today, but had an essentially investigative and prosecutorial function. See 1 Stephen,
            Criminal Law of England, at 221; Langbein, Prosecuting Crime in the Renaissance, at
            34-45. England did not have a professional police force until the 19th century, see 1
            Stephen, supra, at 194-200, so it is not surprising that other government officers
            performed the investigative functions now associated primarily with the police. The
            involvement of government officers in the production of testimonial evidence presents
            the same risk, whether the officers are police or justices of the peace.</p>
         <p>In sum, even if the Sixth Amendment is not solely concerned with testimonial hearsay,
            that is its primary object, and interrogations by law enforcement officers fall squarely
            within that class.<span class="sup">[4]</span>
         </p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B</h2>
         <p>The historical record also supports a second proposition: that the Framers would not
            have allowed admission of testimonial <span class="star-pagination">*54</span>
            statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to
            testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. The text
            of the Sixth Amendment does not suggest any open-ended exceptions from the confrontation
            requirement to be developed by the courts. Rather, the "right . . . to be confronted
            with the witnesses against him," Amdt. 6, is most naturally read as a reference to the
            right of confrontation at common law, admitting only those exceptions established at the
            time of the founding. See Mattox v. United States, 156 U. S. 237, 243 (1895); cf.
            Houser, 26 Mo., at 433-435. As the English authorities above reveal, the common law in
            1791 conditioned admissibility of an absent witness's examination on unavailability and
            a prior opportunity to cross-examine. The Sixth Amendment therefore incorporates those
            limitations. The numerous early state decisions applying the same test confirm that
            these principles were received as part of the common law in this country.<span
               class="sup">[5]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*55</span> We do not read the historical sources to say
            that a prior opportunity to cross-examine was merely a sufficient, rather than a
            necessary, condition for admissibility of testimonial statements. They suggest that this
            requirement was dispositive, <span class="star-pagination">*56</span> and not merely one
            of several ways to establish reliability. This is not to deny, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE
            notes, that "[t]here were always exceptions to the general rule of exclusion" of hearsay
            evidence. Post, at 73. Several had become well established by 1791. See 3 Wigmore §
            1397, at 101; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13, n. 5. But there is scant
            evidence that exceptions were invoked to admit testimonial statements against the
            accused in a criminal case.<span class="sup">[6]</span> Most of the hearsay exceptions
            covered statements that by their nature were not testimonial &#x97; for example,
            business records or statements in furtherance of a conspiracy. We do not infer from
            these that the Framers thought exceptions would apply even to prior testimony. Cf. Lilly
            v. Virginia, 527 U. S. 116, 134 (1999) (plurality opinion) ("[A]ccomplices' confessions
            that inculpate a criminal defendant are not within a firmly rooted exception to the
            hearsay rule").<span class="sup">[7]</span>
         </p>
         <p/>
         <h2>
            <span class="star-pagination">*57</span> IV</h2>
         <p>Our case law has been largely consistent with these two principles. Our leading early
            decision, for example, involved a deceased witness's prior trial testimony. Mattox v.
            United States, 156 U. S. 237 (1895). In allowing the statement to be admitted, we relied
            on the fact that the defendant had had, at the first trial, an adequate opportunity to
            confront the witness: "The substance of the constitutional protection is preserved to
            the prisoner in the advantage he has once had of seeing the witness face to face, and of
            subjecting him to the ordeal of a cross-examination. This, the law says, he shall under
            no circumstances be deprived of . . . ." Id., at 244.</p>
         <p>Our later cases conform to Mattox's holding that prior trial or preliminary hearing
            testimony is admissible only if the defendant had an adequate opportunity to
            cross-examine. See Mancusi v. Stubbs, 408 U. S. 204, 213-216 (1972); California v.
            Green, 399 U. S. 149, 165-168 (1970); Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S., at 406-408; cf. Kirby
            v. United States, 174 U. S. 47, 55-61 (1899). Even where the defendant had such an
            opportunity, we excluded the testimony where the government had not established
            unavailability of the witness. See Barber v. Page, 390 U. S. 719, 722-725 (1968); cf.
            Motes v. United States, 178 U. S. 458, 470-471 (1900). We similarly excluded accomplice
            confessions where the defendant had no opportunity to cross-examine. See Roberts v.
            Russell, 392 U. S. 293, 294-295 (1968) (per curiam); Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S.
            123, 126-128 (1968); Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 415, 418-420 (1965). In contrast, we
            considered reliability factors beyond prior opportunity for cross-examination when the
            hearsay statement at issue was not testimonial. See Dutton v. Evans, 400 U. S., at 87-89
            (plurality opinion).</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*58</span> Even our recent cases, in their outcomes, hew
            closely to the traditional line. Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S., at 67-70, admitted
            testimony from a preliminary hearing at which the defendant had examined the witness.
            Lilly v. Virginia, supra, excluded testimonial statements that the defendant had had no
            opportunity to test by cross-examination. And Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U. S. 171,
            181-184 (1987), admitted statements made unwittingly to a Federal Bureau of
            Investigation informant after applying a more general test that did not make prior
            cross-examination an indispensable requirement.<span class="sup">[8]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Lee v. Illinois, 476 U. S. 530 (1986), on which the State relies, is not to the
            contrary. There, we rejected the State's attempt to admit an accomplice confession. The
            State had argued that the confession was admissible because it "interlocked" with the
            defendant's. We dealt with the argument by rejecting its premise, holding that "when the
            discrepancies between the statements are not insignificant, the codefendant's confession
            may not be admitted." Id., at 545. Respondent argues that "[t]he logical inference of
            this statement <span class="star-pagination">*59</span> is that when the discrepancies
            between the statements are insignificant, then the codefendant's statement may be
            admitted." Brief for Respondent 6. But this is merely a possible inference, not an
            inevitable one, and we do not draw it here. If Lee had meant authoritatively to announce
            an exception &#x97; previously unknown to this Court's jurisprudence &#x97; for
            interlocking confessions, it would not have done so in such an oblique manner. Our only
            precedent on interlocking confessions had addressed the entirely different question
            whether a limiting instruction cured prejudice to codefendants from admitting a
            defendant's own confession against him in a joint trial. See Parker v. Randolph, 442 U.
            S. 62, 69-76 (1979) (plurality opinion), abrogated by Cruz v. New York, 481 U. S. 186
            (1987).</p>
         <p>Our cases have thus remained faithful to the Framers' understanding: Testimonial
            statements of witnesses absent from trial have been admitted only where the declarant is
            unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to
               cross-examine.<span class="sup">[9]</span>
         </p>
         <p/>
         <h2>
            <span class="star-pagination">*60</span> V</h2>
         <p>Although the results of our decisions have generally been faithful to the original
            meaning of the Confrontation Clause, the same cannot be said of our rationales. Roberts
            conditions the admissibility of all hearsay evidence on whether it falls under a "firmly
            rooted hearsay exception" or bears "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness." 448
            U. S., at 66. This test departs from the historical principles identified above in two
            respects. First, it is too broad: It applies the same mode of analysis whether or not
            the hearsay consists of ex parte testimony. This often results in close constitutional
            scrutiny in cases that are far removed from the core concerns of the Clause. At the same
            time, however, the test is too narrow: It admits statements that do consist of ex parte
            testimony upon a mere finding of reliability. This malleable standard often fails to
            protect against paradigmatic confrontation violations.</p>
         <p>Members of this Court and academics have suggested that we revise our doctrine to
            reflect more accurately the original understanding of the Clause. See, e. g., Lilly, 527
            U. S., at 140-143 (BREYER, J., concurring); White, 502 U. S., at 366 <span
               class="star-pagination">*61</span> (THOMAS, J., joined by SCALIA, J., concurring in
            part and concurring in judgment); A. Amar, The Constitution and Criminal Procedure
            125-131 (1997); Friedman, Confrontation: The Search for Basic Principles, 86 Geo. L. J.
            1011 (1998). They offer two proposals: First, that we apply the Confrontation Clause
            only to testimonial statements, leaving the remainder to regulation by hearsay law
            &#x97; thus eliminating the over-breadth referred to above. Second, that we impose an
            absolute bar to statements that are testimonial, absent a prior opportunity to
            cross-examine &#x97; thus eliminating the excessive narrowness referred to above.</p>
         <p>In White, we considered the first proposal and rejected it. 502 U. S., at 352-353.
            Although our analysis in this case casts doubt on that holding, we need not definitively
            resolve whether it survives our decision today, because Sylvia Crawford's statement is
            testimonial under any definition. This case does, however, squarely implicate the second
            proposal.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>Where testimonial statements are involved, we do not think the Framers meant to leave
            the Sixth Amendment's protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence, much less to
            amorphous notions of "reliability." Certainly none of the authorities discussed above
            acknowledges any general reliability exception to the common-law rule. Admitting
            statements deemed reliable by a judge is fundamentally at odds with the right of
            confrontation. To be sure, the Clause's ultimate goal is to ensure reliability of
            evidence, but it is a procedural rather than a substantive guarantee. It commands, not
            that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by
            testing in the crucible of cross-examination. The Clause thus reflects a judgment, not
            only about the desirability of reliable evidence (a point on which there could be little
            dissent), but about how reliability can best be determined. Cf. 3 Blackstone,
            Commentaries, at 373 ("This open examination of witnesses . . . is <span
               class="star-pagination">*62</span> much more conducive to the clearing up of truth");
            M. Hale, History and Analysis of the Common Law of England 258 (1713) (adversarial
            testing "beats and bolts out the Truth much better").</p>
         <p>The Roberts test allows a jury to hear evidence, untested by the adversary process,
            based on a mere judicial determination of reliability. It thus replaces the
            constitutionally prescribed method of assessing reliability with a wholly foreign one.
            In this respect, it is very different from exceptions to the Confrontation Clause that
            make no claim to be a surrogate means of assessing reliability. For example, the rule of
            forfeiture by wrongdoing (which we accept) extinguishes confrontation claims on
            essentially equitable grounds; it does not purport to be an alternative means of
            determining reliability. See Reynolds v. United States, 98 U. S. 145, 158-159
            (1879).</p>
         <p>The Raleigh trial itself involved the very sorts of reliability determinations that
            Roberts authorizes. In the face of Raleigh's repeated demands for confrontation, the
            prosecution responded with many of the arguments a court applying Roberts might invoke
            today: that Cobham's statements were self-inculpatory, 2 How. St. Tr., at 19, that they
            were not made in the heat of passion, id., at 14, and that they were not "extracted from
            [him] upon any hopes or promise of Pardon," id., at 29. It is not plausible that the
            Framers' only objection to the trial was that Raleigh's judges did not properly weigh
            these factors before sentencing him to death. Rather, the problem was that the judges
            refused to allow Raleigh to confront Cobham in court, where he could cross-examine him
            and try to expose his accusation as a lie.</p>
         <p>Dispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to
            dispensing with jury trial because a defendant is obviously guilty. This is not what the
            Sixth Amendment prescribes.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B</h2>
         <p>The legacy of Roberts in other courts vindicates the Framers' wisdom in rejecting a
            general reliability exception. <span class="star-pagination">*63</span> The framework is
            so unpredictable that it fails to provide meaningful protection from even core
            confrontation violations.</p>
         <p>Reliability is an amorphous, if not entirely subjective, concept. There are countless
            factors bearing on whether a statement is reliable; the nine-factor balancing test
            applied by the Court of Appeals below is representative. See, e. g., People v. Farrell,
            34 P. 3d 401, 406-407 (Colo. 2001) (eight-factor test). Whether a statement is deemed
            reliable depends heavily on which factors the judge considers and how much weight he
            accords each of them. Some courts wind up attaching the same significance to opposite
            facts. For example, the Colorado Supreme Court held a statement more reliable because
            its inculpation of the defendant was "detailed," id., at 407, while the Fourth Circuit
            found a statement more reliable because the portion implicating another was "fleeting,"
            United States v. Photogrammetric Data Servs., Inc., 259 F. 3d 229, 245 (2001). The
            Virginia Court of Appeals found a statement more reliable because the witness was in
            custody and charged with a crime (thus making the statement more obviously against her
            penal interest), see Nowlin v. Commonwealth, <span class="citation">

            found a statement more reliable because the witness was not in custody and not a
            suspect, see State v. Bintz, 2002 WI App. 204, ¶ 13, <span class="citation">

            </span>, ¶ 13, 650 N. W. 2d 913, ¶ 13. Finally, the Colorado Supreme Court in one case
            found a statement more reliable because it was given "immediately after" the events at
            issue, Farrell, supra, at 407, while that same court, in another case, found a statement
            more reliable because two years had elapsed, Stevens v. People, 29 P. 3d 305, 316
            (2001).</p>
         <p>The unpardonable vice of the Roberts test, however, is not its unpredictability, but its
            demonstrated capacity to admit core testimonial statements that the Confrontation Clause
            plainly meant to exclude. Despite the plurality's speculation in Lilly, 527 U. S., at
            137, that it was "highly unlikely" that <span class="star-pagination">*64</span>
            accomplice confessions implicating the accused could survive Roberts, courts continue
            routinely to admit them. See Photogrammetric Data Servs., supra, at 245-246; Farrell,

            Courts have invoked Roberts to admit other sorts of plainly testimonial statements
            despite the absence of any opportunity to cross-examine. See United States v. Aguilar,
            295 F. 3d 1018, 1021-1023 (CA9 2002) (plea allocution showing existence of a

            (same).</p>
         <p>To add insult to injury, some of the courts that admit untested testimonial statements
            find reliability in the very factors that make the statements testimonial. As noted
            earlier, one court relied on the fact that the witness's statement was made to police
            while in custody on pending charges &#x97; the theory being that this made the statement
            more clearly against penal interest and thus more reliable. Nowlin, supra, at 335-338,
            579 S. E. 2d, at 371-372. Other courts routinely rely on the fact that a prior statement
            is given under oath in judicial proceedings. E. g., Gallego, supra, at 168 (plea
            allocution); Papajohn, supra, at 1120 (grand jury testimony). That inculpating
            statements are given in a testimonial setting is not an antidote to the confrontation
            problem, but rather the trigger that makes the Clause's demands most urgent. It is not
            enough to point out that most of the usual safeguards of the adversary process attend
            the statement, when the single safeguard missing is the one the Confrontation Clause
            demands.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>C</h2>
         <p>Roberts' failings were on full display in the proceedings below. Sylvia Crawford made
            her statement while in police custody, herself a potential suspect in the case. Indeed,
            she had been told that whether she would be released "depend[ed] on how the
            investigation continues." App. 81. In response to often leading questions from police
            detectives, she implicated her husband in Lee's stabbing and at least arguably
            undermined his self-defense claim. Despite all this, the trial court admitted her
            statement, listing several reasons why it was reliable. In its opinion reversing, the
            Court of Appeals listed several other reasons why the statement was not reliable.
            Finally, the State Supreme Court relied exclusively on the interlocking character of the
               <span class="star-pagination">*66</span> statement and disregarded every other factor
            the lower courts had considered. The case is thus a self-contained demonstration of
            Roberts' unpredictable and inconsistent application.</p>
         <p>Each of the courts also made assumptions that cross-examination might well have
            undermined. The trial court, for example, stated that Sylvia Crawford's statement was
            reliable because she was an eyewitness with direct knowledge of the events. But Sylvia
            at one point told the police that she had "shut [her] eyes and . . . didn't really
            watch" part of the fight, and that she was "in shock." App. 134. The trial court also
            buttressed its reliability finding by claiming that Sylvia was "being questioned by law
            enforcement, and, thus, the [questioner] is . . . neutral to her and not someone who
            would be inclined to advance her interests and shade her version of the truth
            unfavorably toward the defendant." Id., at 77. The Framers would be astounded to learn
            that ex parte testimony could be admitted against a criminal defendant because it was
            elicited by "neutral" government officers. But even if the court's assessment of the
            officer's motives was accurate, it says nothing about Sylvia's perception of her
            situation. Only cross-examination could reveal that.</p>
         <p>The State Supreme Court gave dispositive weight to the interlocking nature of the two
            statements &#x97; that they were both ambiguous as to when and whether Lee had a weapon.
            The court's claim that the two statements were equally ambiguous is hard to accept.
            Petitioner's statement is ambiguous only in the sense that he had lingering doubts about
            his recollection: "A. I could a swore I seen him goin' for somethin' before, right
            before everything happened. . . . [B]ut I'm not positive." Id., at 155. Sylvia's
            statement, on the other hand, is truly inscrutable, since the key timing detail was
            simply assumed in the leading question she was asked: "Q. Did Kenny do anything to fight
            back from this assault?" Id., at 137 (punctuation added). Moreover, Sylvia specifically
               <span class="star-pagination">*67</span> said Lee had nothing in his hands after he
            was stabbed, while petitioner was not asked about that.</p>
         <p>The prosecutor obviously did not share the court's view that Sylvia's statement was
            ambiguous &#x97; he called it "damning evidence" that "completely refutes [petitioner's]
            claim of self-defense." Tr. 468 (Oct. 21, 1999). We have no way of knowing whether the
            jury agreed with the prosecutor or the court. Far from obviating the need for
            cross-examination, the "interlocking" ambiguity of the two statements made it all the
            more imperative that they be tested to tease out the truth.</p>
         <p>We readily concede that we could resolve this case by simply reweighing the "reliability
            factors" under Roberts and finding that Sylvia Crawford's statement falls short. But we
            view this as one of those rare cases in which the result below is so improbable that it
            reveals a fundamental failure on our part to interpret the Constitution in a way that
            secures its intended constraint on judicial discretion. Moreover, to reverse the
            Washington Supreme Court's decision after conducting our own reliability analysis would
            perpetuate, not avoid, what the Sixth Amendment condemns. The Constitution prescribes a
            procedure for determining the reliability of testimony in criminal trials, and we, no
            less than the state courts, lack authority to replace it with one of our own
            devising.</p>
         <p>We have no doubt that the courts below were acting in utmost good faith when they found
            reliability. The Framers, however, would not have been content to indulge this
            assumption. They knew that judges, like other government officers, could not always be
            trusted to safeguard the rights of the people; the likes of the dread Lord Jeffreys were
            not yet too distant a memory. They were loath to leave too much discretion in judicial
            hands. Cf. U. S. Const., Amdt. 6 (criminal jury trial); Amdt. 7 (civil jury trial); Ring
            v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 611-612 (2002) (SCALIA, J., concurring). By replacing
            categorical constitutional guarantees with <span class="star-pagination">*68</span>
            open-ended balancing tests, we do violence to their design. Vague standards are
            manipulable, and, while that might be a small concern in run-of-the-mill assault
            prosecutions like this one, the Framers had an eye toward politically charged cases like
            Raleigh's &#x97; great state trials where the impartiality of even those at the highest
            levels of the judiciary might not be so clear. It is difficult to imagine Roberts'
            providing any meaningful protection in those circumstances.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>* * *</h2>
         <p>Where nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framers'
            design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law &#x97; as
            does Roberts, and as would an approach that exempted such statements from Confrontation
            Clause scrutiny altogether. Where testimonial evidence is at issue, however, the Sixth
            Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity
            for cross-examination. We leave for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive
            definition of "testimonial."<span class="sup">[10]</span> Whatever else the term covers,
            it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand
            jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations. These are the modern practices
            with closest kinship to the abuses at which the Confrontation Clause was directed.</p>
         <p>In this case, the State admitted Sylvia's testimonial statement against petitioner,
            despite the fact that he had no opportunity to cross-examine her. That alone is
            sufficient to make out a violation of the Sixth Amendment. Roberts notwithstanding, we
            decline to mine the record in search of indicia of reliability. Where testimonial
            statements are at <span class="star-pagination">*69</span> issue, the only indicium of
            reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the Constitution
            actually prescribes: confrontation.</p>
         <p>The judgment of the Washington Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for
            further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>
         <p>It is so ordered.</p></div>

         <p>CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR joins, concurring in the
            judgment.</p>
         <p>I dissent from the Court's decision to overrule Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980). I
            believe that the Court's adoption of a new interpretation of the Confrontation Clause is
            not backed by sufficiently persuasive reasoning to overrule long-established precedent.
            Its decision casts a mantle of uncertainty over future criminal trials in both federal
            and state courts, and is by no means necessary to decide the present case.</p>
         <p>The Court's distinction between testimonial and nontestimonial statements, contrary to
            its claim, is no better rooted in history than our current doctrine. Under the common
            law, although the courts were far from consistent, out-of-court statements made by
            someone other than the accused and not taken under oath, unlike ex parte depositions or
            affidavits, were generally not considered substantive evidence upon which a conviction
            could be based.<span class="sup">[1]</span> See, e. g., King v. <span
               class="star-pagination">*70</span> Brasier, 1 Leach 199, 200, 168 Eng. Rep. 202 (K.
            B. 1779); see also J. Langbein, Origins of Adversary Criminal Trial 235-242 (2003); G.
            Gilbert, Evidence 152 (3d ed. 1769).<span class="sup">[2]</span> Testimonial statements
            such as accusatory statements to police officers likely would have been disapproved of
            in the 18th century, not necessarily because they resembled ex parte affidavits or
            depositions as the Court reasons, but more likely than not because they were not made
            under oath.<span class="sup">[3]</span> See King v. Woodcock, 1 Leach 500, 503, 168 Eng.
            Rep. 352, 353 (1789) (noting that a statement taken by a justice of the peace may not be
            admitted into evidence unless taken under oath). <span class="star-pagination"
               >*71</span> Without an oath, one usually did not get to the second step of whether
            confrontation was required.</p>
         <p>Thus, while I agree that the Framers were mainly concerned about sworn affidavits and
            depositions, it does not follow that they were similarly concerned about the Court's
            broader category of testimonial statements. See 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of
            the English Language (1828) (defining "Testimony" as "[a] solemn declaration or
            affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact. Such affirmation
            in judicial proceedings, may be verbal or written, but must be under oath" (emphasis
            added)). As far as I can tell, unsworn testimonial statements were treated no
            differently at common law than were nontestimonial statements, and it seems to me any
            classification of statements as testimonial beyond that of sworn affidavits and
            depositions will be somewhat arbitrary, merely a proxy for what the Framers might have
            intended had such evidence been liberally admitted as substantive evidence like it is
               today.<span class="sup">[4]</span>
         </p>
         <p>I therefore see no reason why the distinction the Court draws is preferable to our
            precedent. Starting with Chief Justice Marshall's interpretation as a Circuit Justice in
            1807, 16 years after the ratification of the Sixth Amendment, United States v. Burr,
               <span class="citation">

            </span>, 193 (No. 14,694) (CC Va. 1807), continuing with our cases in the late 19th
            century, Mattox v. United States, 156 U. S. 237, 243-244 (1895); Kirby <span
               class="star-pagination">*72</span> v. United States, 174 U. S. 47, 54-57 (1899), and
            through today, e. g., White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346, 352-353 (1992), we have never
            drawn a distinction between testimonial and nontestimonial statements. And for that
            matter, neither has any other court of which I am aware. I see little value in trading
            our precedent for an imprecise approximation at this late date.</p>
         <p>I am also not convinced that the Confrontation Clause categorically requires the
            exclusion of testimonial statements. Although many States had their own Confrontation
            Clauses, they were of recent vintage and were not interpreted with any regularity before
            1791. State cases that recently followed the ratification of the Sixth Amendment were
            not uniform; the Court itself cites state cases from the early 19th century that took a
            more stringent view of the right to confrontation than does the Court, prohibiting
            former testimony even if the witness was subjected to cross-examination. See ante, at 50
            (citing Finn v. Commonwealth, <span class="citation no-link">

            </span> (Super. L. &amp;amp; Eq. 1807) (per curiam)).</p>
         <p>Nor was the English law at the time of the framing entirely consistent in its treatment
            of testimonial evidence. Generally ex parte affidavits and depositions were excluded as
            the Court notes, but even that proposition was not universal. See King v. Eriswell, 3 T.
            R. 707, 100 Eng. Rep. 815 (K. B. 1790) (affirming by an equally divided court the
            admission of an ex parte examination because the declarant was unavailable to testify);
            King v. Westbeer, 1 Leach 12, 13, 168 Eng. Rep. 108, 109 (1739) (noting the admission of
            an ex parte affidavit); see also 1 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 585-586 (1736) (noting
            that statements of "accusers and witnesses" which were taken under oath could be
            admitted into evidence if the declarant was "dead or not able to travel"). Wigmore notes
            that sworn examinations of witnesses before justices of the peace in certain cases would
            not have been excluded <span class="star-pagination">*73</span> until the end of the
            1700's, 5 Wigmore § 1364, at 26-27, and sworn statements of witnesses before coroners
            became excluded only by statute in the 1800's, see ibid.; id., § 1374, at 59. With
            respect to unsworn testimonial statements, there is no indication that once the hearsay
            rule was developed courts ever excluded these statements if they otherwise fell within a
            firmly rooted exception. See, e. g., Eriswell, supra, at 715-719 (Buller, J.), 720
            (Ashhurst, J.), 100 Eng. Rep., at 819-822 (concluding that an ex parte examination was
            admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule because it was a declaration by a party
            of his state and condition). Dying declarations are one example. See, e. g., Woodcock,
            supra, at 502-504, 168 Eng. Rep., at 353-354; King v. Reason, 16 How. St. Tr. 1, 22-23
            (K. B. 1722).</p>
         <p>Between 1700 and 1800 the rules regarding the admissibility of out-of-court statements
            were still being developed. See n. 1, supra. There were always exceptions to the general
            rule of exclusion, and it is not clear to me that the Framers categorically wanted to
            eliminate further ones. It is one thing to trace the right of confrontation back to the
            Roman Empire; it is quite another to conclude that such a right absolutely excludes a
            large category of evidence. It is an odd conclusion indeed to think that the Framers
            created a cut-and-dried rule with respect to the admissibility of testimonial statements
            when the law during their own time was not fully settled.</p>
         <p>To find exceptions to exclusion under the Clause is not to denigrate it as the Court
            suggests. Chief Justice Marshall stated of the Confrontation Clause: "I know of no
            principle in the preservation of which all are more concerned. I know none, by
            undermining which, life, liberty and property, might be more endangered. It is therefore
            incumbent on courts to be watchful of every inroad on a principle so truly important."
            Burr, 25 F. Cas., at 193. Yet, he recognized that such a right was not absolute,
            acknowledging that exceptions <span class="star-pagination">*74</span> to the
            exclusionary component of the hearsay rule, which he considered as an "inroad" on the
            right to confrontation, had been introduced. See ibid.</p>
         <p>Exceptions to confrontation have always been derived from the experience that some
            out-of-court statements are just as reliable as cross-examined in-court testimony due to
            the circumstances under which they were made. We have recognized, for example, that
            co-conspirator statements simply "cannot be replicated, even if the declarant testifies
            to the same matters in court." United States v. Inadi, 475 U. S. 387, 395 (1986).
            Because the statements are made while the declarant and the accused are partners in an
            illegal enterprise, the statements are unlikely to be false and their admission
            "actually furthers the `Confrontation Clause's very mission' which is to `advance the
            accuracy of the truth-determining process in criminal trials.'" Id., at 396 (quoting
            Tennessee v. Street, 471 U. S. 409, 415 (1985) (some internal quotation marks omitted)).
            Similar reasons justify the introduction of spontaneous declarations, see White, 502 U.
            S., at 356, statements made in the course of procuring medical services, see ibid.,
            dying declarations, see Kirby, supra, at 61, and countless other hearsay exceptions.
            That a statement might be testimonial does nothing to undermine the wisdom of one of
            these exceptions.</p>
         <p>Indeed, cross-examination is a tool used to flesh out the truth, not an empty procedure.
            See Kentucky v. Stincer, 482 U. S. 730, 737 (1987) ("The right to cross-examination,
            protected by the Confrontation Clause, thus is essentially a `functional' right designed
            to promote reliability in the truth-finding functions of a criminal trial"); see also
            Maryland v. Craig, 497 U. S. 836, 845 (1990) ("The central concern of the Confrontation
            Clause is to ensure the reliability of the evidence against a criminal defendant by
            subjecting it to rigorous testing in the context of an adversary proceeding before the
            trier of fact"). "[I]n a given instance [cross-examination <span class="star-pagination"
               >*75</span> may] be superfluous; it may be sufficiently clear, in that instance, that
            the statement offered is free enough from the risk of inaccuracy and untrustworthiness,
            so that the test of cross-examination would be a work of supererogation." 5 Wigmore §
            1420, at 251. In such a case, as we noted over 100 years ago, "The law in its wisdom
            declares that the rights of the public shall not be wholly sacrificed in order that an
            incidental benefit may be preserved to the accused." Mattox, 156 U. S., at 243; see also
            Salinger v. United States, 272 U. S. 542, 548 (1926). By creating an immutable category
            of excluded evidence, the Court adds little to a trial's truth-finding function and
            ignores this longstanding guidance.</p>
         <p>In choosing the path it does, the Court of course overrules Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S.
            56 (1980), a case decided nearly a quarter of a century ago. Stare decisis is not an
            inexorable command in the area of constitutional law, see Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S.
            808, 828 (1991), but by and large, it "is the preferred course because it promotes the
            evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters
            reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of
            the judicial process," id., at 827. And in making this appraisal, doubt that the new
            rule is indeed the "right" one should surely be weighed in the balance. Though there are
            no vested interests involved, unresolved questions for the future of everyday criminal
            trials throughout the country surely counsel the same sort of caution. The Court grandly
            declares that "[w]e leave for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive
            definition of `testimonial,'" ante, at 68. But the thousands of federal prosecutors and
            the tens of thousands of state prosecutors need answers as to what beyond the specific
            kinds of "testimony" the Court lists, see ibid., is covered by the new rule. They need
            them now, not months or years from now. Rules of criminal evidence are applied every day
            in courts throughout <span class="star-pagination">*76</span> the country, and parties
            should not be left in the dark in this manner.</p>
         <p>To its credit, the Court's analysis of "testimony" excludes at least some hearsay
            exceptions, such as business records and official records. See ante, at 56. To hold
            otherwise would require numerous additional witnesses without any apparent gain in the
            truth-seeking process. Likewise to the Court's credit is its implicit recognition that
            the mistaken application of its new rule by courts which guess wrong as to the scope of
            the rule is subject to harmless-error analysis. See ante, at 42, n. 1.</p>
         <p>But these are palliatives to what I believe is a mistaken change of course. It is a
            change of course not in the least necessary to reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court
            of Washington in this case. The result the Court reaches follows inexorably from Roberts
            and its progeny without any need for overruling that line of cases. In Idaho v. Wright,
            497 U. S. 805, 820-824 (1990), we held that an out-of-court statement was not admissible
            simply because the truthfulness of that statement was corroborated by other evidence at
            trial. As the Court notes, ante, at 66, the Supreme Court of Washington gave decisive
            weight to the "interlocking nature of the two statements." No re-weighing of the
            "reliability factors," which is hypothesized by the Court, ante, at 67, is required to
            reverse the judgment here. A citation to Idaho v. Wright, supra, would suffice. For the
            reasons stated, I believe that this would be a far preferable course for the Court to
            take here.</p>

         <p>[3] These sources &#x97; especially Raleigh's trial &#x97; refute THE CHIEF JUSTICE's
            assertion, post, at 71 (opinion concurring in judgment), that the right of confrontation
            was not particularly concerned with unsworn testimonial statements. But even if, as he
            claims, a general bar on unsworn hearsay made application of the Confrontation Clause to
            unsworn testimonial statements a moot point, that would merely change our focus from
            direct evidence of original meaning of the Sixth Amendment to reasonable inference. We
            find it implausible that a provision which concededly condemned trial by sworn ex parte
            affidavit thought trial by unsworn ex parte affidavit perfectly OK. (The claim that
            unsworn testimony was self-regulating because jurors would disbelieve it, cf. post, at
            69-70, n. 1, is belied by the very existence of a general bar on unsworn testimony.) Any
            attempt to determine the application of a constitutional provision to a phenomenon that
            did not exist at the time of its adoption (here, allegedly, admissible unsworn
            testimony) involves some degree of estimation &#x97; what THE CHIEF JUSTICE calls use of
            a "proxy," post, at 71 &#x97; but that is hardly a reason not to make the estimation as
            accurate as possible. Even if, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE mistakenly asserts, there were no
            direct evidence of how the Sixth Amendment originally applied to unsworn testimony,
            there is no doubt what its application would have been.</p>
         <p>[4] We use the term "interrogation" in its colloquial, rather than any technical legal,
            sense. Cf. Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U. S. 291, 300-301 (1980). Just as various
            definitions of "testimonial" exist, one can imagine various definitions of
            "interrogation," and we need not select among them in this case. Sylvia's recorded
            statement, knowingly given in response to structured police questioning, qualifies under
            any conceivable definition.</p>
         <p>[5] THE CHIEF JUSTICE claims that English law's treatment of testimonial statements was
            inconsistent at the time of the framing, post, at 72-73, but the examples he cites
            relate to examinations under the Marian statutes. As we have explained, to the extent
            Marian examinations were admissible, it was only because the statutes derogated from the
            common law. See supra, at 46-47. Moreover, by 1791 even the statutory-derogation view
            had been rejected with respect to justice-of-the-peace examinations &#x97; explicitly in
            King v. Woodcock, 1 Leach 500, 502-504, 168 Eng. Rep. 352, 353 (1789), and King v.
            Dingler, 2 Leach 561, 562-563, 168 Eng. Rep. 383, 383-384 (1791), and by implication in
            King v. Radbourne, 1 Leach 457, 459-461, 168 Eng. Rep. 330, 331-332 (1787). </p>
         <p>None of THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S citations proves otherwise. King v. Westbeer, 1 Leach 12,
            168 Eng. Rep. 108 (1739), was decided a half century earlier and cannot be taken as an
            accurate statement of the law in 1791 given the directly contrary holdings of Woodcock
            and Dingler. Hale's treatise is older still, and far more ambiguous on this point, see 1
            M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 585-586 (1736); some who espoused the requirement of a prior
            opportunity for cross-examination thought it entirely consistent with Hale's views. See
            Fenwick's Case, 13 How. St. Tr. 537, 602 (H. C. 1696) (Musgrave). The only timely
            authority THE CHIEF JUSTICE cites is King v. Eriswell, 3 T. R. 707, 100 Eng. Rep. 815
            (K. B. 1790), but even that decision provides no substantial support. Eriswell was not a
            criminal case at all, but a Crown suit against the inhabitants of a town to charge them
            with care of an insane pauper. Id., at 707-708, 100 Eng. Rep., at 815-816. It is
            relevant only because the judges discuss the Marian statutes in dicta. One of them,
            Buller, J., defended admission of the pauper's statement of residence on the basis of
            authorities that purportedly held ex parte Marian examinations admissible. Id., at
            713-714, 100 Eng. Rep., at 819. As evidence writers were quick to point out, however,
            his authorities said no such thing. See Peake, Evidence, at 64, n. (m) ("Mr. J. Buller
            is reported to have said that it was so settled in 1 Lev. 180, and Kel. 55; certainly
            nothing of the kind appears in those books"); 2 T. Starkie, Evidence 487-488, n. (c)
            (1826) ("Buller, J. . . . refers to Radbourne's case . . .; but in that case the
            deposition was taken in the hearing of the prisoner, and of course the question did not
            arise" (citation omitted)). Two other judges, Grose, J., and Kenyon, C. J., responded to
            Buller's argument by distinguishing Marian examinations as a statutory exception to the
            common-law rule, but the context and tenor of their remarks suggest they merely assumed
            the accuracy of Buller's premise without independent consideration, at least with
            respect to examinations by justices of the peace. See 3 T. R., at 710, 100 Eng. Rep., at
            817 (Grose, J.); id., at 722-723, 100 Eng. Rep., at 823-824 (Kenyon, C. J.). In fact,
            the case reporter specifically notes in a footnote that their assumption was erroneous.
            See id., at 710, n. (c), 100 Eng. Rep., at 817, n. (c). Notably, Buller's position on
            pauper examinations was resoundingly rejected only a decade later in King v. Ferry
            Frystone, 2 East 54, 55, 102 Eng. Rep. 289 (K. B. 1801) ("The point . . . has been since
            considered to be so clear against the admissibility of the evidence . . . that it was
            abandoned by the counsel . . . without argument"), further suggesting that his views on
            evidence were not mainstream at the time of the framing.</p>
         <p>In short, none of THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S sources shows that the law in 1791 was unsettled
            even as to examinations by justices of the peace under the Marian statutes. More
            importantly, however, even if the statutory rule in 1791 were in doubt, the numerous
            early state-court decisions make abundantly clear that the Sixth Amendment incorporated
            the common-law right of confrontation and not any exceptions the Marian statutes
            supposedly carved out from it. See supra, at 49-50; see also supra, at 47, n. 2 (coroner
            statements). The common-law rule had been settled since Paine in 1696. See King v.
            Paine, 5 Mod. 163, 165, 87 Eng. Rep. 584, 585 (K. B.).</p>
         <p>[6] The one deviation we have found involves dying declarations. The existence of that
            exception as a general rule of criminal hearsay law cannot be disputed. See, e. g.,
            Mattox v. United States, 156 U. S. 237, 243-244 (1895); King v. Reason, 16 How. St. Tr.
            1, 24-38 (K. B. 1722); 1 D. Jardine, Criminal Trials 435 (1832); Cooley, Constitutional
            Limitations, at *318; 1 G. Gilbert, Evidence 211 (C. Lofft ed. 1791); see also F.
            Heller, The Sixth Amendment 105 (1951) (asserting that this was the only recognized
            criminal hearsay exception at common law). Although many dying declarations may not be
            testimonial, there is authority for admitting even those that clearly are. See Woodcock,
            supra, at 501-504, 168 Eng. Rep., at 353-354; Reason, supra, at 24-38; Peake, supra, at
            64; cf. Radbourne, supra, at 460-462, 168 Eng. Rep., at 332-333. We need not decide in
            this case whether the Sixth Amendment incorporates an exception for testimonial dying
            declarations. If this exception must be accepted on historical grounds, it is sui
            generis.</p>
         <p>[7] We cannot agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE that the fact "[t]hat a statement might be
            testimonial does nothing to undermine the wisdom of one of these [hearsay] exceptions."
            Post, at 74. Involvement of government officers in the production of testimony with an
            eye toward trial presents unique potential for prosecutorial abuse &#x97; a fact borne
            out time and again throughout a history with which the Framers were keenly familiar.
            This consideration does not evaporate when testimony happens to fall within some broad,
            modern hearsay exception, even if that exception might be justifiable in other
            circumstances.</p>
         <p>[8] One case arguably in tension with the rule requiring a prior opportunity for
            cross-examination when the proffered statement is testimonial is White v. Illinois, 502
            U. S. 346 (1992), which involved, inter alia, statements of a child victim to an
            investigating police officer admitted as spontaneous declarations. Id., at 349-351. It
            is questionable whether testimonial statements would ever have been admissible on that
            ground in 1791; to the extent the hearsay exception for spontaneous declarations existed
            at all, it required that the statements be made "immediat[ely] upon the hurt received,
            and before [the declarant] had time to devise or contrive any thing for her own
            advantage." Thompson v. Trevanion, Skin. 402, 90 Eng. Rep. 179 (K. B. 1693). In any
            case, the only question presented in White was whether the Confrontation Clause imposed
            an unavailability requirement on the types of hearsay at issue. See 502 U. S., at
            348-349. The holding did not address the question whether certain of the statements,
            because they were testimonial, had to be excluded even if the witness was unavailable.
            We "[took] as a given . . . that the testimony properly falls within the relevant
            hearsay exceptions." Id., at 351, n. 4.</p>
         <p>[9] THE CHIEF JUSTICE complains that our prior decisions have "never drawn a
            distinction" like the one we now draw, citing in particular Mattox v. United States, 156
            U. S. 237 (1895), Kirby v. United States, 174 U. S. 47 (1899), and United States v.
            Burr, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/moctapp/a2Da/state-v-burr/">
                  <span class="volume">25</span>
                  <span class="reporter">F. Cas.</span>
                  <span class="page">187</span>
               </a>
            </span> (No. 14,694) (CC Va. 1807) (Marshall, C. J.). Post, at 71-72. But nothing in
            these cases contradicts our holding in any way. Mattox and Kirby allowed or excluded
            evidence depending on whether the defendant had had an opportunity for
            cross-examination. Mattox, supra, at 242-244; Kirby, supra, at 55-61. That the two cases
            did not extrapolate a more general class of evidence to which that criterion applied
            does not prevent us from doing so now. As to Burr, we disagree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE's
            reading of the case. Although Chief Justice Marshall made one passing reference to the
            Confrontation Clause, the case was fundamentally about the hearsay rules governing
            statements in furtherance of a conspiracy. The "principle so truly important" on which
            "inroad[s]" had been introduced was the "rule of evidence which rejects mere hearsay
            testimony." See 25 F. Cas., at 193. Nothing in the opinion concedes exceptions to the
            Confrontation Clause's exclusion of testimonial statements as we use the term. THE CHIEF
            JUSTICE fails to identify a single case (aside from one minor, arguable exception, see
            supra, at 58, n. 8), where we have admitted testimonial statements based on indicia of
            reliability other than a prior opportunity for cross-examination. If nothing else, the
            test we announce is an empirically accurate explanation of the results our cases have
            reached. </p>
         <p>Finally, we reiterate that, when the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial,
            the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior
            testimonial statements. See California v. Green, 399 U. S. 149, 162 (1970). It is
            therefore irrelevant that the reliability of some out-of-court statements "`cannot be
            replicated, even if the declarant testifies to the same matters in court.'" Post, at 74
            (quoting United States v. Inadi, 475 U. S. 387, 395 (1986)). The Clause does not bar
            admission of a statement so long as the declarant is present at trial to defend or
            explain it. (The Clause also does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes
            other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted. See Tennessee v. Street, 471
            U. S. 409, 414 (1985).)</p>
         <p>[10] We acknowledge THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S objection, post, at 75-76, that our refusal to
            articulate a comprehensive definition in this case will cause interim uncertainty. But
            it can hardly be any worse than the status quo. See supra, at 63-67, and cases cited.
            The difference is that the Roberts test is inherently, and therefore permanently,
            unpredictable.</p>
         <p>[1] Modern scholars have concluded that at the time of the founding the law had yet to
            fully develop the exclusionary component of the hearsay rule and its attendant
            exceptions, and thus hearsay was still often heard by the jury. See Gallanis, The Rise
            of Modern Evidence Law, 84 Iowa L. Rev. 499, 534-535 (1999); Mosteller, Remaking
            Confrontation Clause and Hearsay Doctrine Under the Challenge of Child Sexual Abuse
            Prosecutions, 1993 U. Ill. L. Rev. 691, 738-746. In many cases, hearsay alone was
            generally not considered sufficient to support a conviction; rather, it was used to
            corroborate sworn witness testimony. See 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 1364, pp. 17, 19-20,
            19, n. 33 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1974) (hereinafter Wigmore) (noting in the 1600's and early
            1700's testimonial and non-testimonial hearsay was permissible to corroborate direct
            testimony); see also J. Langbein, Origins of Adversary Criminal Trial 238-239 (2003).
            Even when unsworn hearsay was proffered as substantive evidence, however, because of the
            predominance of the oath in society, juries were largely skeptical of it. See Landsman,
            Rise of the Contentious Spirit: Adversary Procedure in Eighteenth Century England, 75
            Cornell L. Rev. 497, 506 (1990) (describing late 17th-century sentiments); Langbein,
            Criminal Trial before the Lawyers, 45 U. Chi. L. Rev. 263, 291-293 (1978). In the 18th
            century, unsworn hearsay was simply held to be of much lesser value than were sworn
            affidavits or depositions.</p>
         <p>[2] Gilbert's noted in 1769: </p>
         <p>"Hearsay is no Evidence . . . though a Person Testify what he hath heard upon Oath, yet
            the Person who spake it was not upon Oath; and if a Man had been in Court and said the
            same Thing and had not sworn it, he had not been believed in a Court of Justice; for all
            Credit being derived from Attestation and Evidence, it can rise no higher than the
            Fountain from whence it flows, and if the first Speech was without Oath, an Oath that
            there was such a Speech makes it no more than a bare speaking, and so of no Value in a
            Court of Justice, where all Things were determined under the Solemnities of an Oath . .
            . ."</p>
         <p>[3] Confessions not taken under oath were admissible against a confessor because "`the
            most obvious Principles of Justice, Policy, and Humanity'" prohibited an accused from
            attesting to his statements. 1 G. Gilbert, Evidence 216 (C. Lofft ed. 1791). Still,
            these unsworn confessions were considered evidence only against the confessor as the
            Court points out, see ante, at 52, and in cases of treason, were insufficient to support
            even the conviction of the confessor, 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, ch. 46, § 4, p.
            604, n. 3 (T. Leach 6th ed. 1787).</p>
         <p>[4] The fact that the prosecution introduced an unsworn examination in 1603 at Sir
            Walter Raleigh's trial, as the Court notes, see ante, at 52, says little about the
            Court's distinction between testimonial and nontestimonial statements. Our precedent
            indicates that unsworn testimonial statements, as do some nontestimonial statements,
            raise confrontation concerns once admitted into evidence, see, e. g., Lilly v. Virginia,
            527 U. S. 116 (1999); Lee v. Illinois, 476 U. S. 530 (1986), and I do not contend
            otherwise. My point is not that the Confrontation Clause does not reach these
            statements, but rather that it is far from clear that courts in the late 18th century
            would have treated unsworn statements, even testimonial ones, the same as sworn
            statements.</p>
