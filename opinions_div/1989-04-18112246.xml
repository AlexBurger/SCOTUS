            <span class="star-pagination">*109</span> JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the
            Court.</p>
         <p>This case requires us to determine whether a company's policy of paying its discharged
            employees for their unused vacation time constitutes an "employee welfare benefit plan"
            within the meaning of § 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
            (ERISA or Act), 88 Stat. 833, as amended, 29 U. S. C. § 1002(1), and whether a criminal
            action to enforce that policy is foreclosed by the Act's broad pre-emption
            provision.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>In May 1986, petitioner, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, issued two complaints in the
            Boston Municipal Court against respondent, Richard N. Morash, president of the Yankee
            Bank for Finance and Savings (Bank). The complaints charged Morash with criminal
            violations of the Massachusetts Payment of Wages Statute, Mass. Gen. Laws § 149:148
               (1987).<span class="sup">[1]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Under the Massachusetts law, an employer is required to pay a discharged employee his
            full wages, including holiday or vacation payments, on the date of discharge. Similar
            wage payment statutes have been enacted by 47 other States,<span class="sup">[2]</span>
            the <span class="star-pagination">*110</span> District of Columbia,<span class="sup"
               >[3]</span> and the United States,<span class="sup">[4]</span> and over half of these
            include vacation pay. The complaints filed in the Boston Municipal Court alleged that
            respondent had failed to compensate two discharged bank vice presidents for vacation
            time they accrued but did not use.</p>
         <p>Respondent moved to dismiss the criminal complaints on the ground that the Massachusetts
            statute, insofar as it applied to these complaints, had been pre-empted by ERISA. He
            argued that the Bank's vacation policy constituted an "employee welfare benefit plan"
            under the Act, and that the State's prosecution of him for failure to comply with the
            policy therefore ran afoul of § 514(a) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. <span
               class="star-pagination">*111</span> § 1144(a), which pre-empts "any and all State
            laws insofar as they . . . relate to any employee benefit plan."<span class="sup"
               >[5]</span> Without ruling on the motion, the trial judge reported the pre-emption
            question to the Massachusetts Appeals Court for decision; the Supreme Judicial Court
            then transferred the case to its docket on its own initiative. For the purpose of
            answering the reported question, the parties stipulated that the Bank had made oral or
            written agreements stemming from handbooks, manuals, memoranda, and practices to pay
            employees in lieu of unused vacation time, and that "such payments are made out of the
            Bank's general assets" in lump sums upon termination of employment.</p>
         <p>The Supreme Judicial Court held that the policy constituted an employee welfare benefit
            plan and that the prosecution was pre-empted by ERISA. <span class="citation">

               </a>
            </span>, 522 N. E. 2d 409 (1988). The court found that under the plain language of the
            statute and its earlier decision in Barry v. Dymo Graphic Systems, Inc., <span
               class="citation">
               <a href="/mass/cwmJ/barry-v-dymo-graphic-systems-inc/">

                  <span class="page">830</span>
               </a>
            </span>, 478 N. E. 2d 707 (1985), the Bank's policy constituted a plan, fund, or program
            for the purpose of providing its participants vacation benefits. It rejected the
            Commonwealth's argument that a regulation promulgated by the Secretary of Labor
               (Secretary),<span class="sup">[6]</span>
            <span class="star-pagination">*112</span> had excepted payments out of an employer's
            general assets for unused vacation time from the definition of a welfare plan because
            even if regular vacation pay was not included in ERISA, the lump-sum payment for unused
            vacation time upon discharge was akin to severance pay covered by ERISA. The fact that
            it would be necessary for an employer to maintain records relating to its employees'
            unused vacation time, plus the need to accumulate funds to pay the benefits, made it
            appropriate to treat the employer's promise to its employees as a "plan." The court
            concluded that the Massachusetts statute related to the plan within the meaning of §
            514, and was not excluded from its coverage by the provision saving from pre-emption a
            "generally applicable criminal law." ERISA § 514(b)(4), 29 U. S. C. § 1144(b)(4).</p>
         <p>Because the federal question decided by the Supreme Judicial Court is an important one
            over which the courts have disagreed,<span class="sup">[7]</span> we granted certiorari,
            488 U. S. 815 (1988). We now reverse.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>ERISA was passed by Congress in 1974 to safeguard employees from the abuse and
            mismanagement of funds that had been accumulated to finance various types of employee
            benefits. Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S. 1, 15 <span
               class="star-pagination">*113</span> (1987). The "comprehensive and reticulated
            statute," Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 446 U. S. 359, 361
            (1980), contains elaborate provisions for the regulation of employee benefit plans. It
            sets forth reporting and disclosure obligations for plans, imposes a fiduciary standard
            of care for plan administrators, and establishes schedules for the vesting and accrual
            of pension benefits. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 732
            (1985). Suits to enforce the terms of the statute and to recover welfare benefits
            wrongfully withheld arise under federal law and can be brought in federal court without
            regard for the amount in controversy. See Firestone Tire &amp;amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch,
            489 U. S. 101, 108 (1989).</p>
         <p>The precise coverage of ERISA is not clearly set forth in the Act. ERISA covers
            "employee benefit plans," which it defines as plans that are either "an employee welfare
            benefit plan," or "an employee pension benefit plan," or both. ERISA § 3(3), 29 U. S. C.
            § 1002(3). An employee welfare benefit plan, in turn, is defined as:</p> "[A]ny plan,
         fund, or program which was heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an
         employer or by an employee organization, or by both, to the extent that such plan, fund, or
         program was established or is maintained for the purpose of providing for its participants
         or their beneficiaries, through the purchase of insurance or otherwise, (A) medical,
         surgical, or hospital care or benefits, or benefits in the event of sickness, accident,
         disability, death or unemployment, or vacation benefits, apprenticeship or other training
         programs, or day care centers, scholarship funds, or prepaid legal services, or (B) any
         benefit described in section 186(c) of this title (other than pensions on retirement or
         death, and insurance to provide such pensions)." ERISA § 3(1), as codified, 29 U. S. C. §
            1002(1).<span class="sup">[8]</span>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*114</span> The Act does not further define "plan, fund,
            or program" or "vacation benefits" and does not specify whether every policy to provide
            vacation benefits falls within its ambit.</p>
         <p>The words "any plan, fund, or program . . . maintained for the purpose of providing . .
            . vacation benefits" may surely be read to encompass any form of regular vacation
            payments to an employee. A multiemployer fund created to provide vacation benefits for
            union members who typically work for several employers during the course of a year, see,
            e. g., Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern
            Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 4, n. 2 (1983), undoubtedly falls within the scope of the Act. In
            addition, the creation of a separate fund to pay employees vacation benefits would
            subject a single employer to the regulatory provisions of ERISA. See California Hospital
            Assn. v. Henning, 770 F. 2d 856, 861 (1985), modified, 783 F. 2d 946 (CA9), cert.
            denied, 477 U. S. 904 (1986).<span class="sup">[9]</span> We do not believe, however,
            that the policy here to pay employees for unused vacation time constitutes an employee
            welfare benefit plan.</p>
         <p>The interpretation of § 3(1) is governed by the familiar principles that " `words
            grouped in a list should be given related <span class="star-pagination">*115</span>
            meaning,' " Schreiber v. Burlington Northern, Inc., 472 U. S. 1, 8 (1985) (quoting
            Securities Industry Assn. v. Board of Governors, FRS, 468 U. S. 207, 218 (1984)), and
            that "in expounding a statute, we [are] not . . . guided by a single sentence or member
            of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and
            policy." Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 51 (1987). In enacting ERISA,
            Congress' primary concern was with the mismanagement of funds accumulated to finance
            employee benefits and the failure to pay employees benefits from accumulated funds.
            California Hospital Assn., supra, at 859.<span class="sup">[10]</span> To that end, it
            established extensive reporting, disclosure, and fiduciary duty requirements to insure
            against the possibility that the employee's expectation of the benefit would be defeated
            through poor management by the plan administrator. Because ordinary vacation payments
            are typically fixed, due at known times, and do not depend on contingencies outside the
            employee's control, they present none of the risks that ERISA is intended to address. If
            there is a danger of defeated expectations, it is no different from the danger of
            defeated expectations of wages for services performed &#x97; a danger Congress chose not
            to regulate in ERISA.</p>
         <p>This conclusion is supported by viewing the reference to vacation benefits not in
            isolation but in light of the words that accompany it and give the provision meaning.
            Section 3(1) subjects to ERISA regulation plans to provide medical, sickness, accident,
            disability, and death benefits, training programs, day care centers, scholarship funds,
            and legal services. The distinguishing feature of most of these benefits is <span
               class="star-pagination">*116</span> that they accumulate over a period of time and
            are payable only upon the occurrence of a contingency outside of the control of the
            employee. See 40 Fed. Reg. 24642 (1975). Thus, for example, plans to pay employees
            severance benefits, which are payable only upon termination of employment, are employee
            welfare benefit plans within the meaning of the Act. See Holland v. Burlington
            Industries, Inc., 772 F. 2d 1140 (CA4 1985), summarily aff'd sub nom. Brooks v.
            Burlington Industries, Inc., 477 U. S. 901 (1986); Gilbert v. Burlington Industries,
            Inc., 765 F. 2d 320 (CA2 1985), summarily aff'd sub nom. Roberts v. Burlington
            Industries, Inc., 477 U. S. 901 (1986). The reference to vacation payments in § 3(1)
            should be understood to include within the scope of ERISA those vacation benefit funds,
            analogous to other welfare benefits, in which either the employee's right to a benefit
            is contingent upon some future occurrence or the employee bears a risk different from
            his ordinary employment risk. It is unlikely that Congress intended to subject to
            ERISA's reporting and disclosure requirements those vacation benefits which by their
            nature are payable on a regular basis from the general assets of the employer and are
            accumulated over time only at the election of the employee.</p>
         <p>The Secretary, who is specifically authorized to define ERISA's "accounting, technical,
            and trade terms," ERISA § 505, 29 U. S. C. § 1135,<span class="sup">[11]</span> and to
            whose reasonable views we give deference, Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources
            Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843 (1984); Watt v. Alaska, 451 U. S. 259, 272-273
            (1981); Udall v. Tallman, 380 U. S. 1, 16 (1965), has also so understood the statute. In
            a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published shortly after the effective date of the Act,
            the Secretary identified a basic <span class="star-pagination">*117</span> distinction
            between the benefit programs covered by the Act and the types of regular compensation,
            including vacation pay, that are not covered:</p> "The Secretary also anticipates
         issuance of regulations that will make it clear that other programs, including certain
         employer practices (whether pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement or not) under
         which employees are paid as a part of their regular compensation directly by the employer
         and under which no separate fund is established will not subject the employer to any filing
         or disclosure duties under Title I of the Act. Examples of the employer practices that may
         receive this treatment are payment of overtime pay, vacation pay, shift premiums, Sunday
         premiums, holiday premiums, jury duty or military duty, make-up pay, and pay while absent
         on account of illness or excused absences." 39 Fed. Reg. 42236 (1974) (emphasis added).
            <p>The Secretary subsequently proposed regulations excluding payment of compensation for
            work performed at night or during holidays and paid sick leave and vacation leave from
            the definition of an employee benefit. 40 Fed. Reg. 24642-24643 (1975). He
            explained:</p> "[P]aid vacations . . . are not treated as employee benefit plans because
         they are associated with regular wages or salary, rather than benefits triggered by
         contingencies such as hospitalization. Moreover, the abuses which created the impetus for
         the reforms in Title I were not in this area, and there is no indication that Congress
         intended to subject these practices to Title I coverage." Ibid. <p>The proposed regulations
            promulgated by the Secretary were adopted without significant modification. They provide
            that numerous "payroll practices," including the payment of vacation benefits "out of
            [an] employer's general assets" rather than from a trust fund, are not employee <span
               class="star-pagination">*118</span> welfare benefit plans within the meaning of
               ERISA.<span class="sup">[12]</span> In addition, under the regulations, the term
            "employee welfare benefit plan" does not include the payment by an employer of premium
            rates for work performed during special periods such as holidays and weekends.<span
               class="sup">[13]</span> The Secretary has consistently adhered to this position even
            when the premium pay is accumulated and carried over to later years.<span class="sup"
               >[14]</span>
         </p>
         <p>A contrary interpretation, including routine vacation pay policies within ERISA, would
            have profound consequences. Most employers in the United States provide some type of
            vacation benefit to their employees.<span class="sup">[15]</span> ERISA coverage would
            put all these employers to the choice of complying with the statute's detailed
            requirements for reporting and disclosure or discontinuing the practice of compensating
            employees for unused vacation time. In addition, the extension of ERISA to claims for
            vacation benefits would vastly expand the jurisdiction of the federal courts, providing
            a federal <span class="star-pagination">*119</span> forum for any employee with a
            vacation grievance.<span class="sup">[16]</span> Finally, such an interpretation would
            also displace the extensive state regulation of the vesting, funding, and participation
            rights of vacation benefits; because ERISA's vesting and funding requirements do not
            apply to welfare benefit plans, ERISA §§ 201(1), 301(a), as amended, 29 U. S. C. §§
            1051(1), 1081(a), employees would actually receive less protection if ERISA were applied
            to ordinary vacation wages paid from the employer's general assets. See Note, 87 Colum.
            L. Rev. 1702, 1718 (1987).<span class="sup">[17]</span> The States have traditionally
            regulated the payment of wages, including vacation pay. Absent any indication that
            Congress intended such far-reaching consequences, we are reluctant to so significantly
            interfere with "the separate spheres of governmental authority preserved in our
            <ref type="" num="">Federalist</ref> system." Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S., at 19.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>Respondent argues that, even if the Department of Labor regulation exempting vacation
            payments from ERISA constitutes a reasonable construction of the Act, the Bank's policy
            did not constitute a payroll practice under the regulation because employees were
            allowed at their option to accumulate vacation time and defer payment for such time
            until termination. See Brief for Respondent 11. We do not agree. Although neither of the
            Secretary's regulations explicitly covers the precise practice at issue in this case,
            the reasons for treating holiday and weekend premiums and payments of compensation while
            an employee is on vacation as "payroll <span class="star-pagination">*120</span>
            practices" are equally applicable to the payment of an employee's regular wages for
            accrued and unused vacation time upon discharge. If the employees in this case had
            chosen to take a vacation, the vacation days would have been available and the vacation
            benefit would have been excluded under the regulation; the benefit cannot be transformed
            into an employee welfare benefit plan under ERISA solely because the employees did not
            use their vacation days prior to their formal termination of employment. See Shea v.
            Wells Fargo Armored Service Corp., 810 F. 2d 372, 377 (CA2 1987).</p>
         <p>Moreover, except for the fact that the payment has been deferred, such payments are as
            much a part of the employees' regular basic compensation as overtime pay or the payment
            of salary while the employee is absent on vacation. If in the end the employee elects to
            receive additional compensation instead of a paid vacation, he or she is receiving the
            same kind of premium pay that is available for holiday or weekend work. The fact that
            the payments in this case were due at the time of the employee's termination does not
            affect their character as a part of regular compensation. Unlike normal severance pay,
            the employees' right to compensation for accrued vacation time is not contingent upon
            the termination of their employment.</p>
         <p>In reaching this conclusion, we emphasize that the case before us &#x97; and the
            Secretary's regulations on which we rely &#x97; concern payments by a single employer
            out of its general assets. An entirely different situation would be presented if a
            separate fund had been created by a group of employers to guarantee the payment of
            vacation benefits to laborers who regularly shift their jobs from one employer to
            another. Employees who are beneficiaries of such a trust face far different risks and
            have far greater need for the reporting and disclosure requirements that the federal law
            imposes than those whose vacation benefits come from the same fund from which they
            receive their paychecks. It is sufficient for this case that the Secretary's
            determination that a single employer's <span class="star-pagination">*121</span>
            administration of a vacation pay policy from its general assets does not possess the
            characteristics of a welfare benefit plan constitutes a reasonable construction of the
               statute.<span class="sup">[18]</span>

         <p>[8] The benefits described "in section 186(c) of this title" include "pooled vacation,
            holiday, severance or similar benefits." See 29 U. S. C. § 186(c)(6).</p>
         <p>[9] Respondent argues that because a pooled vacation benefit plan is "a benefit
            described in section 186(c) of this title" and thus constitutes an employee welfare
            benefit plan under 29 U. S. C. § 1002(1)(B), the exclusion of ordinary vacation pay
            plans from ERISA coverage would render the reference to vacation pay in clause (A)
            surplusage. Clause (A), however, also includes within ERISA vacation wages paid from a
            separate fund rather than from general assets. See United States Dept. of Labor, ERISA
            Opinion Letter No. 77-84A (Nov. 7, 1977). The fact that a benefit covered by clause (B)
            is also covered by clause (A) is not dispositive of the meaning of clause (A). As the
            Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit noted: "Many of the benefits incorporated in
            section 1002(1) by the cross-reference to section 186(c) are already found in section
            1002(1). Thus it is evident that Congress was not concerned with duplication, but only
            with assuring that all benefits covered by section 186(c) were also covered by section
            1002(1)." California Hospital Assn. v. Henning, 770 F. 2d 856, 861 (1985), modified, 783

         <p>[16] A 1983 survey found that state agencies each year resolve more than 19,000 vacation
            pay claims, involving more than $7.5 million. Note, 16 Loyola U. Chi. L. J. 387, 422

            Colum. L. Rev. 1702, 1714 (1987), and for the administrative resolution of vacation pay
            claims, Note, 16 Loyola U. Chi. L. J., at 421-422. An interpretation of ERISA to include
            ordinary vacation pay would imperil these mechanisms designed for the benefit of
            employees.</p>
