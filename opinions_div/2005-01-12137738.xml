         <p>JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court in part.<span class="sup">[*]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The question presented in each of these cases is whether an application of the Federal
            Sentencing Guidelines violated the Sixth Amendment. In each case, the courts below held
            that binding rules set forth in the Guidelines limited the severity of the sentence that
            the judge could lawfully impose on the defendant based on the facts found by the jury at
            his trial. In both cases the courts rejected, on the basis of our decision in Blakely v.
            Washington, 542 U. S. 296 (2004), the Government's recommended application of the
            Sentencing Guidelines because the proposed sentences were based on additional facts that
            the sentencing judge found by a preponderance of the evidence. We hold that both courts
            correctly concluded that the Sixth Amendment as construed in <span
               class="star-pagination">*227</span> Blakely does apply to the Sentencing Guidelines.
            In a separate opinion authored by JUSTICE BREYER, the Court concludes that in light of
            this holding, two provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA) that have the
            effect of making the Guidelines mandatory must be invalidated in order to allow the
            statute to operate in a manner consistent with congressional intent.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>Respondent Booker was charged with possession with intent to distribute at least 50
            grams of cocaine base (crack). Having heard evidence that he had 92.5 grams in his
            duffel bag, the jury found him guilty of violating 21 U. S. C. § 841(a)(1). That statute
            prescribes a minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life for
            that offense. § 841(b)(1)(A)(iii).</p>
         <p>Based upon Booker's criminal history and the quantity of drugs found by the jury, the
            Sentencing Guidelines required the District Court Judge to select a "base" sentence of
            not less than 210 nor more than 262 months in prison. See United States Sentencing
            Commission, Guidelines Manual §§ 2D1.1(c)(4), 4A1.1 (Nov. 2003) (USSG). The judge,
            however, held a post-trial sentencing proceeding and concluded by a preponderance of the
            evidence that Booker had possessed an additional 566 grams of crack and that he was
            guilty of obstructing justice. Those findings mandated that the judge select a sentence
            between 360 months and life imprisonment; the judge imposed a sentence at the low end of
            the range. Thus, instead of the sentence of 21 years and 10 months that the judge could
            have imposed on the basis of the facts proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt,
            Booker received a 30-year sentence.</p>
         <p>Over the dissent of Judge Easterbrook, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held
            that this application of the Sentencing Guidelines conflicted with our holding in
            Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000), that "[o]ther than the fact of a
            prior conviction, any fact that increases <span class="star-pagination">*228</span> the
            penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,
            and proved beyond a reasonable doubt." 375 F. 3d 508, 510 (2004). The majority relied on
            our holding in Blakely, 542 U. S. 296, that "the `statutory maximum' for Apprendi
            purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts
            reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant." Id., at 303. The court held
            that the sentence violated the Sixth Amendment, and remanded with instructions to the
            District Court either to sentence respondent within the sentencing range supported by
            the jury's findings or to hold a separate sentencing hearing before a jury.</p>
         <p>Respondent Fanfan was charged with conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent
            to distribute at least 500 grams of cocaine in violation of 21 U. S. C. §§ 846,
            841(a)(1), and 841(b)(1)(B)(ii). He was convicted by the jury after it answered "Yes" to
            the question "Was the amount of cocaine 500 or more grams?" App. C to Pet. for Cert. in
            No. 04-105, p. 15a. Under the Guidelines, without additional findings of fact, the
            maximum sentence authorized by the jury verdict was imprisonment for 78 months.</p>
         <p>A few days after our decision in Blakely, the trial judge conducted a sentencing hearing
            at which he found additional facts that, under the Guidelines, would have authorized a
            sentence in the 188-to-235-month range. Specifically, he found that respondent Fanfan
            was responsible for 2.5 kilograms of cocaine powder, and 261.6 grams of crack. He also
            concluded that respondent had been an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in the
            criminal activity. Both findings were made by a preponderance of the evidence. Under the
            Guidelines, these additional findings would have required an enhanced sentence of 15 or
            16 years instead of the 5 or 6 years authorized by the jury verdict alone. Relying not
            only on the majority opinion in Blakely, but also on the categorical statements in the
            dissenting opinions and in the Solicitor <span class="star-pagination">*229</span>
            General's brief in Blakely, see App. A to Pet. for Cert. in No. 04-105, pp. 6a-7a, the
            judge concluded that he could not follow the particular provisions of the Sentencing
            Guidelines "which involve drug quantity and role enhancement," id., at 11a. Expressly
            refusing to make "any blanket decision about the federal guidelines," he followed the
            provisions of the Guidelines that did not implicate the Sixth Amendment by imposing a
            sentence on respondent "based solely upon the jury verdict in this case." Ibid.</p>
         <p>Following the denial of its motion to correct the sentence in Fanfan's case, the
            Government filed a notice of appeal in the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, and a
            petition in this Court for a writ of certiorari before judgment. Because of the
            importance of the questions presented, we granted that petition, 542 U. S. 956 (2004),
            as well as a similar petition filed by the Government in Booker's case, ibid. In both
            petitions, the Government asks us to determine whether our Apprendi line of cases
            applies to the Sentencing Guidelines, and if so, what portions of the Guidelines remain
            in effect.<span class="sup">[1]</span>
         </p>
         <p>In this opinion, we explain why we agree with the lower courts' answer to the first
            question. In a separate opinion for the Court, JUSTICE BREYER explains the Court's
            answer to the second question.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>
            <span class="star-pagination">*230</span> II</h2>
         <p>It has been settled throughout our history that the Constitution protects every criminal
            defendant "against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact
            necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged." In re Winship, 397 U. S.
            358, 364 (1970). It is equally clear that the "Constitution gives a criminal defendant
            the right to demand that a jury find him guilty of all the elements of the crime with
            which he is charged." United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 511 (1995). These basic
            precepts, firmly rooted in the common law, have provided the basis for recent decisions
            interpreting modern criminal statutes and sentencing procedures.</p>
         <p>In Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 230 (1999), we considered the federal
            carjacking statute, which provides three different maximum sentences depending on the
            extent of harm to the victim: 15 years in jail if there was no serious injury to a
            victim, 25 years if there was "serious bodily injury," and life in prison if death
            resulted. 18 U. S. C. § 2119 (1988 ed., Supp. V). In spite of the fact that the statute
            "at first glance has a look to it suggesting [that the provisions relating to the extent
            of harm to the victim] are only sentencing provisions," 526 U. S., at 232, we concluded
            that the harm to the victim was an element of the crime. That conclusion was supported
            by the statutory text and structure, and was influenced by our desire to avoid the
            constitutional issues implicated by a contrary holding, which would have reduced the
            jury's role "to the relative importance of low-level gate-keeping." Id., at 244.
            Foreshadowing the result we reach today, we noted that our holding was consistent with a
            "rule requiring jury determination of facts that raise a sentencing ceiling" in state
            and federal sentencing guidelines systems. Id., at 251-252, n. 11.</p>
         <p>In Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), the defendant pleaded guilty to
            second-degree possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose, which carried a prison
            term <span class="star-pagination">*231</span> of 5-to-10 years. Thereafter, the trial
            court found that his conduct had violated New Jersey's "hate crime" law because it was
            racially motivated, and imposed a 12-year sentence. This Court set aside the enhanced
            sentence. We held: "Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases
            the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a
            jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt." Id., at 490.</p>
         <p>The fact that New Jersey labeled the hate crime a "sentence enhancement" rather than a
            separate criminal act was irrelevant for constitutional purposes. Id., at 478. As a
            matter of simple justice, it seemed obvious that the procedural safeguards designed to
            protect Apprendi from punishment for the possession of a firearm should apply equally to
            his violation of the hate crime statute. Merely using the label "sentence enhancement"
            to describe the latter did not provide a principled basis for treating the two crimes
            differently. Id., at 476.</p>
         <p>In Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584 (2002), we reaffirmed our conclusion that the
            characterization of critical facts is constitutionally irrelevant. There, we held that
            it was impermissible for "the trial judge, sitting alone" to determine the presence or
            absence of the aggravating factors required by Arizona law for imposition of the death
            penalty. Id., at 588-589. "If a State makes an increase in a defendant's authorized
            punishment contingent on the finding of a fact, that fact&#x97;no matter how the State
            labels it&#x97;must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt." Id., at 602. Our
            opinion made it clear that ultimately, while the procedural error in Ring's case might
            have been harmless because the necessary finding was implicit in the jury's guilty
            verdict, id., at 609, n. 7, "the characterization of a fact or circumstance as an
            `element' or a `sentencing factor' is not determinative of the question `who decides,'
            judge or jury," id., at 605.</p>
         <p>In Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296 (2004), we dealt with a determinate sentencing
            scheme similar to the Federal <span class="star-pagination">*232</span> Sentencing
            Guidelines. There the defendant pleaded guilty to kidnaping, a class B felony punishable
            by a term of not more than 10 years. Other provisions of Washington law, comparable to
            the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, mandated a "standard" sentence of 49-to-53 months,
            unless the judge found aggravating facts justifying an exceptional sentence. Although
            the prosecutor recommended a sentence in the standard range, the judge found that the
            defendant had acted with "`deliberate cruelty'" and sentenced him to 90 months. Id., at
            300.</p>
         <p>For reasons explained in Jones, Apprendi, and Ring, the requirements of the Sixth
            Amendment were clear. The application of Washington's sentencing scheme violated the
            defendant's right to have the jury find the existence of "`any particular fact'" that
            the law makes essential to his punishment. 542 U. S., at 301. That right is implicated
            whenever a judge seeks to impose a sentence that is not solely based on "facts reflected
            in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant." Id., at 303 (emphasis deleted). We
            rejected the State's argument that the jury verdict was sufficient to authorize a
            sentence within the general 10-year sentence for class B felonies, noting that under
            Washington law, the judge was required to find additional facts in order to impose the
            greater 90-month sentence. Our precedents, we explained, make clear "that the `statutory
            maximum' for Apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the
            basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant." Ibid.
            (emphasis in original). The determination that the defendant acted with deliberate
            cruelty, like the determination in Apprendi that the defendant acted with racial malice,
            increased the sentence that the defendant could have otherwise received. Since this fact
            was found by a judge using a preponderance of the evidence standard, the sentence
            violated Blakely's Sixth Amendment rights.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*233</span> As the dissenting opinions in Blakely
            recognized, there is no distinction of constitutional significance between the Federal
            Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue in that case. See, e. g.,
            542 U. S., at 325 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.) ("The structure of the Federal Guidelines
            likewise does not, as the Government half-heartedly suggests, provide any grounds for
            distinction. . . . If anything, the structural differences that do exist make the
            Federal Guidelines more vulnerable to attack"). This conclusion rests on the premise,
            common to both systems, that the relevant sentencing rules are mandatory and impose
            binding requirements on all sentencing judges.</p>
         <p>If the Guidelines as currently written could be read as merely advisory provisions that
            recommended, rather than required, the selection of particular sentences in response to
            differing sets of facts, their use would not implicate the Sixth Amendment. We have
            never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a
            sentence within a statutory range. See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 481; Williams v. New
            York, 337 U. S. 241, 246 (1949). Indeed, everyone agrees that the constitutional issues
            presented by these cases would have been avoided entirely if Congress had omitted from
            the SRA the provisions that make the Guidelines binding on district judges; it is that
            circumstance that makes the Court's answer to the second question presented possible.
            For when a trial judge exercises his discretion to select a specific sentence within a
            defined range, the defendant has no right to a jury determination of the facts that the
            judge deems relevant.</p>
         <p>The Guidelines as written, however, are not advisory; they are mandatory and binding on
            all judges.<span class="sup">[2]</span> While subsection <span class="star-pagination"
               >*234</span> (a) of § 3553 of the sentencing statute<span class="sup">[3]</span>
            lists the Sentencing Guidelines as one factor to be considered in imposing a sentence,
            subsection (b) directs that the court "shall impose a sentence of the kind, and within
            the range" established by the Guidelines, subject to departures in specific, limited
            cases. (Emphasis added.) Because they are binding on judges, we have consistently held
            that the Guidelines have the force and effect of laws. See, e. g., Mistretta v. United
            States, 488 U. S. 361, 391 (1989); Stinson v. United States, 508 U. S. 36, 42
            (1993).</p>
         <p>The availability of a departure in specified circumstances does not avoid the
            constitutional issue, just as it did not in Blakely itself. The Guidelines permit
            departures from the prescribed sentencing range in cases in which the judge "finds that
            there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not
            adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the
            guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described." 18 U. S. C.
            A. § 3553(b)(1) (Supp. 2004). At first glance, one might believe that the ability of a
            district judge to depart from the Guidelines means that she is bound only by the
            statutory maximum. Were this the case, there would be no Apprendi problem. Importantly,
            however, departures are not available in every case, and in fact are unavailable in
            most. In most cases, as a matter of law, the Commission will have adequately taken all
            relevant factors into account, and no departure will be legally permissible. In those
            instances, the judge is bound to impose a sentence within the Guidelines range. It was
            for this reason that we rejected a similar argument in Blakely, holding that although
            the Washington statute allowed the judge to impose a sentence outside the sentencing
            range for "`substantial and compelling reasons,'" that exception was not available for
            Blakely himself. 542 U. S., at 299. The sentencing judge <span class="star-pagination"
               >*235</span> would have been reversed had he invoked the departure section to justify
            the sentence.</p>
         <p>Booker's case illustrates the mandatory nature of the Guidelines. The jury convicted him
            of possessing at least 50 grams of crack in violation of 21 U. S. C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(iii)
            based on evidence that he had 92.5 grams of crack in his duffel bag. Under these facts,
            the Guidelines specified an offense level of 32, which, given the defendant's criminal
            history category, authorized a sentence of 210-to-262 months. See USSG § 2D1.1(c)(4).
            Booker's is a run-of-the-mill drug case, and does not present any factors that were
            inadequately considered by the Commission. The sentencing judge would therefore have
            been reversed had he not imposed a sentence within the level 32 Guidelines range.</p>
         <p>Booker's actual sentence, however, was 360 months, almost 10 years longer than the
            Guidelines range supported by the jury verdict alone. To reach this sentence, the judge
            found facts beyond those found by the jury: namely, that Booker possessed 566 grams of
            crack in addition to the 92.5 grams in his duffel bag. The jury never heard any evidence
            of the additional drug quantity, and the judge found it true by a preponderance of the
            evidence. Thus, just as in Blakely, "the jury's verdict alone does not authorize the
            sentence. The judge acquires that authority only upon finding some additional fact." 542
            U. S., at 305. There is no relevant distinction between the sentence imposed pursuant to
            the Washington statutes in Blakely and the sentences imposed pursuant to the Federal
            Sentencing Guidelines in these cases.</p>
         <p>In his dissent, post, at 327-329, JUSTICE BREYER argues on historical grounds that the
            Guidelines scheme is constitutional across the board. He points to traditional judicial
            authority to increase sentences to take account of any unusual blameworthiness in the
            manner employed in committing a crime, an authority that the Guidelines require to be
            exercised consistently throughout the system. This tradition, <span
               class="star-pagination">*236</span> however, does not provide a sound guide to
            enforcement of the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a jury trial in today's world.</p>
         <p>It is quite true that once determinate sentencing had fallen from favor, American judges
            commonly determined facts justifying a choice of a heavier sentence on account of the
            manner in which particular defendants acted. Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 481. In 1986,
            however, our own cases first recognized a new trend in the legislative regulation of
            sentencing when we considered the significance of facts selected by legislatures that
            not only authorized, or even mandated, heavier sentences than would otherwise have been
            imposed, but increased the range of sentences possible for the underlying crime. See
            McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 87-88 (1986). Provisions for such enhancements
            of the permissible sentencing range reflected growing and wholly justified legislative
            concern about the proliferation and variety of drug crimes and their frequent
            identification with firearms offenses.</p>
         <p>The effect of the increasing emphasis on facts that enhanced sentencing ranges, however,
            was to increase the judge's power and diminish that of the jury. It became the judge,
            not the jury, who determined the upper limits of sentencing, and the facts determined
            were not required to be raised before trial or proved by more than a preponderance.</p>
         <p>As the enhancements became greater, the jury's finding of the underlying crime became
            less significant. And the enhancements became very serious indeed. See, e. g., Jones,
            526 U. S., at 230-231 (judge's finding increased the maximum sentence from 15 to 25
            years); respondent Booker's case (from 262 months to a life sentence); respondent
            Fanfan's case (from 78 to 235 months); United States v. Rodriguez, 73 F. 3d 161, 162-163
            (CA7 1996) (Posner, C. J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (from
            approximately 54 months to a life sentence); United States v. Hammoud, 381 F. 3d 316,
               <span class="star-pagination">*237</span> 361-362 (CA4 2004) (en banc) (Motz, J.,
            dissenting) (actual sentence increased from 57 months to 155 years).</p>
         <p>As it thus became clear that sentencing was no longer taking place in the tradition that
            JUSTICE BREYER invokes, the Court was faced with the issue of preserving an ancient
            guarantee under a new set of circumstances. The new sentencing practice forced the Court
            to address the question how the right of jury trial could be preserved, in a meaningful
            way guaranteeing that the jury would still stand between the individual and the power of
            the government under the new sentencing regime. And it is the new circumstances, not a
            tradition or practice that the new circumstances have superseded, that have led us to
            the answer first considered in Jones and developed in Apprendi and subsequent cases
            culminating with this one. It is an answer not motivated by Sixth Amendment formalism,
            but by the need to preserve Sixth Amendment substance.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>The Government advances three arguments in support of its submission that we should not
            apply our reasoning in Blakely to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. It contends that
            Blakely is distinguishable because the Guidelines were promulgated by a Commission
            rather than the Legislature; that principles of stare decisis require us to follow four
            earlier decisions that are arguably inconsistent with Blakely; and that the application
            of Blakely to the Guidelines would conflict with separation-of-powers principles
            reflected in Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361 (1989). These arguments are
            unpersuasive.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>
            <i>Commission v. Legislature:</i>
         </h2>
         <p>In our judgment the fact that the Guidelines were promulgated by the Sentencing
            Commission, rather than Congress, lacks constitutional significance. In order to impose
            the defendants' sentences under the Guidelines, the judges in these <span
               class="star-pagination">*238</span> cases were required to find an additional fact,
            such as drug quantity, just as the judge found the additional fact of serious bodily
            injury to the victim in Jones. As far as the defendants are concerned, they face
            significantly higher sentences &#x97; in Booker's case almost 10 years higher &#x97;
            because a judge found true by a preponderance of the evidence a fact that was never
            submitted to the jury. Regardless of whether Congress or a Sentencing Commission
            concluded that a particular fact must be proved in order to sentence a defendant within
            a particular range, "[t]he Framers would not have thought it too much to demand that,
            before depriving a man of [ten] more years of his liberty, the State should suffer the
            modest inconvenience of submitting its accusation to `the unanimous suffrage of twelve
            of his equals and neighbours,' rather than a lone employee of the State." Blakely, 542
            U. S., at 313-314 (citation omitted).</p>
         <p>The Government correctly notes that in Apprendi we referred to "`any fact that increases
            the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum . . . .'" Brief for
            United States 15 (quoting Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 490 (emphasis in Brief for United
            States)). The simple answer, of course, is that we were only considering a statute in
            that case; we expressly declined to consider the Guidelines. See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at
            497, n. 21. It was therefore appropriate to state the rule in that case in terms of a
            "statutory maximum" rather than answering a question not properly before us.</p>
         <p>More important than the language used in our holding in Apprendi are the principles we
            sought to vindicate. Those principles are unquestionably applicable to the Guidelines.
            They are not the product of recent innovations in our jurisprudence, but rather have
            their genesis in the ideals our constitutional tradition assimilated from the common
            law. See Jones, 526 U. S., at 244-248. The Framers of the Constitution understood the
            threat of "judicial despotism" that could arise from "arbitrary punishments upon
            arbitrary convictions" <span class="star-pagination">*239</span> without the benefit of
            a jury in criminal cases. The <ref type="intent" num="83">Federalist</ref> No. 83, p. 499 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A.
            Hamilton). The Founders presumably carried this concern from England, in which the right
            to a jury trial had been enshrined since the Magna Carta. As we noted in Apprendi:</p>
         "[T]he historical foundation for our recognition of these principles extends down centuries
         into the common law. `[T]o guard against a spirit of oppression and tyranny on the part of
         rulers,' and `as the great bulwark of [our] civil and political liberties,' trial by jury
         has been understood to require that `the truth of every accusation, whether preferred in
         the shape of indictment, information, or appeal, should afterwards be confirmed by the
         unanimous suffrage of twelve of [the defendant's] equals and neighbours . . . .'" 530 U.
         S., at 477 (citations omitted). <p>Regardless of whether the legal basis of the accusation
            is in a statute or in guidelines promulgated by an independent commission, the
            principles behind the jury trial right are equally applicable.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>
            <i>Stare Decisis:</i>
         </h2>
         <p>The Government next argues that four recent cases preclude our application of Blakely to
            the Sentencing Guidelines. We disagree. In United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U. S. 87
            (1993), we held that the provisions of the Guidelines that require a sentence
            enhancement if the judge determines that the defendant committed perjury do not violate
            the privilege of the accused to testify on her own behalf. There was no contention that
            the enhancement was invalid because it resulted in a more severe sentence than the jury
            verdict had authorized. Accordingly, we found this case indistinguishable from United
            States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41 (1978), a pre-Guidelines case in which we upheld a
            similar sentence increase. Applying Blakely to the Guidelines would invalidate <span
               class="star-pagination">*240</span> a sentence that relied on such an enhancement if
            the resulting sentence was outside the range authorized by the jury verdict.
            Nevertheless, there are many situations in which the district judge might find that the
            enhancement is warranted, yet still sentence the defendant within the range authorized
            by the jury. See post, at 276-279 (STEVENS, J., dissenting in part). Thus, while the
            reach of Dunnigan may be limited, we need not overrule it.</p>
         <p>In Witte v. United States, 515 U. S. 389 (1995), we held that the Double Jeopardy Clause
            did not bar a prosecution for conduct that had provided the basis for an enhancement of
            the defendant's sentence in a prior case. "We concluded that `consideration of
            information about the defendant's character and conduct at sentencing does not result in
            "punishment" for any offense other than the one of which the defendant was convicted.'
            Rather, the defendant is `punished only for the fact that the present offense was
            carried out in a manner that warrants increased punishment . . . .'" United States v.
            Watts, 519 U. S. 148, 155 (1997) (per curiam) (emphasis deleted) (quoting Witte, 515 U.
            S., at 401, 403). In Watts, relying on Witte, we held that the Double Jeopardy Clause
            permitted a court to consider acquitted conduct in sentencing a defendant under the
            Guidelines. In neither Witte nor Watts was there any contention that the sentencing
            enhancement had exceeded the sentence authorized by the jury verdict in violation of the
            Sixth Amendment. The issue we confront today simply was not presented.<span class="sup"
               >[4]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Finally, in Edwards v. United States, 523 U. S. 511 (1998), the Court held that a jury's
            general verdict finding the defendants guilty of a conspiracy involving either cocaine
            or crack supported a sentence based on their involvement with <span
               class="star-pagination">*241</span> both drugs. Even though the indictment had
            charged that their conspiracy embraced both, they argued on appeal that the verdict
            limited the judge's sentencing authority. We recognized that the defendants' statutory
            and constitutional claims might have had merit if it had been possible to argue that
            their crack-related activities were not part of the same conspiracy as their cocaine
            activities. But they failed to make that argument, and, based on our review of the
            record which showed "a series of interrelated drug transactions involving both cocaine
            and crack," we concluded that no such claim could succeed.<span class="sup"

         <p>None of our prior cases is inconsistent with today's decision. Stare decisis does not

         <h2>
            <i>Separation of Powers:</i>
         </h2>
         <p>Finally, the Government and, to a lesser extent, JUSTICE BREYER's dissent, argue that
            any holding that would require Guidelines sentencing factors to be proved to a jury
            beyond a reasonable doubt would effectively transform them into a code defining elements
            of criminal offenses. The result, according to the Government, would be an
            unconstitutional grant to the Sentencing Commission of the inherently legislative power
            to define criminal elements.</p>
         <p>There is no merit to this argument because the Commission's authority to identify the
            facts relevant to sentencing <span class="star-pagination">*242</span> decisions and to
            determine the impact of such facts on federal sentences is precisely the same whether
            one labels such facts "sentencing factors" or "elements" of crimes. Our decision in
            Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 371, upholding the validity of the delegation of that
            authority, is unaffected by the characterization of such facts, or by the procedures
            used to find such facts in particular sentencing proceedings. Indeed, we rejected a
            similar argument in Jones:</p> "Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, the constitutional
         proposition that drives our concern in no way `call[s] into question the principle that the
         definition of the elements of a criminal offense is entrusted to the legislature.' The
         constitutional guarantees that give rise to our concern in no way restrict the ability of
         legislatures to identify the conduct they wish to characterize as criminal or to define the
         facts whose proof is essential to the establishment of criminal liability. The
         constitutional safeguards that figure in our analysis concern not the identity of the
         elements defining criminal liability but only the required procedures for finding the facts
         that determine the maximum permissible punishment; these are the safeguards going to the
         formality of notice, the identity of the factfinder, and the burden of proof." 526 U. S.,
         at 243, n. 6 (citation omitted). <p>Our holding today does not call into question any
            aspect of our decision in Mistretta. That decision was premised on an understanding that
            the Commission, rather than performing adjudicatory functions, instead makes political
            and substantive decisions. 488 U. S., at 393. We noted that the promulgation of the
            Guidelines was much like other activities in the Judicial Branch, such as the creation
            of the Federal Rules of Evidence, all of which are nonadjudicatory activities. Id., at
            387. We also noted that "Congress may delegate to the Judicial Branch nonadjudicatory
            functions that do not trench upon the prerogatives of another Branch and <span
               class="star-pagination">*243</span> that are appropriate to the central mission of
            the Judiciary." Id., at 388. While we recognized that the Guidelines were more
            substantive than the Rules of Evidence or other nonadjudicatory functions delegated to
            the Judicial Branch, we nonetheless concluded that such a delegation did not exceed
            Congress' powers.</p>
         <p>Further, a recognition that the Commission did not exercise judicial authority, but was
            more properly thought of as exercising some sort of legislative power, ibid., was
            essential to our holding. If the Commission in fact performed adjudicatory functions, it
            would have violated Article III because some of the members were not Article III judges.
            As we explained:</p> "[T]he `practical consequences' of locating the Commission within
         the Judicial Branch pose no threat of undermining the integrity of the Judicial Branch or
         of expanding the powers of the Judiciary beyond constitutional bounds by uniting within the
         Branch the political or quasi-legislative power of the Commission with the judicial power
         of the courts. [The Commission's] powers are not united with the powers of the Judiciary in
         a way that has meaning for separation-of-powers analysis. Whatever constitutional problems
         might arise if the powers of the Commission were vested in a court, the Commission is not a
         court, does not exercise judicial power, and is not controlled by or accountable to members
         of the Judicial Branch." Id., at 393. <p>We have thus always recognized the fact that the
            Commission is an independent agency that exercises policymaking authority delegated to
            it by Congress. Nothing in our holding today is inconsistent with our decision in
            Mistretta.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>IV</h2>
         <p>All of the foregoing supports our conclusion that our holding in Blakely applies to the
            Sentencing Guidelines. We <span class="star-pagination">*244</span> recognize, as we did
            in Jones, Apprendi, and Blakely, that in some cases jury factfinding may impair the most
            expedient and efficient sentencing of defendants. But the interest in fairness and
            reliability protected by the right to a jury trial &#x97; a common-law right that
            defendants enjoyed for centuries and that is now enshrined in the Sixth Amendment &#x97;
            has always outweighed the interest in concluding trials swiftly. Blakely, 542 U. S., at
            313. As Blackstone put it:</p> "[H]owever convenient these [new methods of trial] may
         appear at first, (as doubtless all arbitrary powers, well executed, are the most
         convenient) yet let it be again remembered, that delays, and little inconveniences in the
         forms of justice, are the price that all free nations must pay for their liberty in more
         substantial matters; that these inroads upon this sacred bulwark of the nation are
         fundamentally opposite to the spirit of our constitution; and that, though begun in
         trifles, the precedent may gradually increase and spread, to the utter disuse of juries in
         questions of the most momentous concerns." 4 Commentaries on the Laws of England 343-344
         (1769). <p>Accordingly, we reaffirm our holding in Apprendi: Any fact (other than a prior
            conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by
            the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the
            defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p></div>
      <div type="majority" judge="breyer">
         <p>JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court in part.<span class="sup">[*]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The first question that the Government has presented in these cases is the
            following:</p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*245</span> "Whether the Sixth Amendment is violated by the
         imposition of an enhanced sentence under the United States Sentencing Guidelines based on
         the sentencing judge's determination of a fact (other than a prior conviction) that was not
         found by the jury or admitted by the defendant." Pet. for Cert. in No. 04-104, p. (I).
            <p>The Court, in an opinion by JUSTICE STEVENS, answers this question in the
            affirmative. Applying its decisions in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), and
            Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296 (2004), to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the
            Court holds that, in the circumstances mentioned, the Sixth Amendment requires juries,
            not judges, to find facts relevant to sentencing. See ante, at 226-227, 244 (STEVENS,
            J., opinion of the Court).</p>
         <p>We here turn to the second question presented, a question that concerns the remedy. We
            must decide whether or to what extent, "as a matter of severability analysis," the
            Guidelines "as a whole" are "inapplicable . . . such that the sentencing court must
            exercise its discretion to sentence the defendant within the maximum and minimum set by
            statute for the offense of conviction." Pet. for Cert. in No. 04-104, p. (I).</p>
         <p>We answer the question of remedy by finding the provision of the federal sentencing
            statute that makes the Guidelines mandatory, 18 U. S. C. A. § 3553(b)(1) (Supp. 2004),
            incompatible with today's constitutional holding. We conclude that this provision must
            be severed and excised, as must one other statutory section, § 3742(e) (main ed. and
            Supp. 2004), which depends upon the Guidelines' mandatory nature. So modified, the
            federal sentencing statute, see Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Sentencing Act), as
            amended, 18 U. S. C. § 3551 et seq., 28 U. S. C. § 991 et seq., makes the Guidelines
            effectively advisory. It requires a sentencing court to consider Guidelines ranges, see
            18 U. S. C. A. § 3553(a)(4) (Supp. 2004), but it permits the court to tailor the
            sentence in light <span class="star-pagination">*246</span> of other statutory concerns
            as well, see § 3553(a) (Supp. 2004).</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>We answer the remedial question by looking to legislative intent. See, e. g., Minnesota
            v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U. S. 172, 191 (1999); Alaska Airlines, Inc.
            v. Brock, 480 U. S. 678, 684 (1987); Regan v. Time, Inc., 468 U. S. 641, 653 (1984)
            (plurality opinion). We seek to determine what "Congress would have intended" in light
            of the Court's constitutional holding. Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium,
            Inc. v. FCC, 518 U. S. 727, 767 (1996) (plurality opinion) ("Would Congress still have
            passed" the valid sections "had it known" about the constitutional invalidity of the
            other portions of the statute? (internal quotation marks omitted)). In this instance, we
            must determine which of the two following remedial approaches is the more compatible
            with the Legislature's intent as embodied in the 1984 Sentencing Act.</p>
         <p>One approach, that of JUSTICE STEVENS' dissent, would retain the Sentencing Act (and the
            Guidelines) as written, but would engraft onto the existing system today's Sixth
            Amendment "jury trial" requirement. The addition would change the Guidelines by
            preventing the sentencing court from increasing a sentence on the basis of a fact that
            the jury did not find (or that the offender did not admit).</p>
         <p>The other approach, which we now adopt, would (through severance and excision of two
            provisions) make the Guidelines system advisory while maintaining a strong connection
            between the sentence imposed and the offender's real conduct &#x97; a connection
            important to the increased uniformity of sentencing that Congress intended its
            Guidelines system to achieve.</p>
         <p>Both approaches would significantly alter the system that Congress designed. But today's
            constitutional holding means that it is no longer possible to maintain the judicial
            factfinding that Congress thought would underpin the mandatory <span
               class="star-pagination">*247</span> Guidelines system that it sought to create and
            that Congress wrote into the Act in 18 U. S. C. A. §§ 3553(a) and 3661 (main ed. and
            Supp. 2004). Hence we must decide whether we would deviate less radically from Congress'
            intended system (1) by superimposing the constitutional requirement announced today or
            (2) through elimination of some provisions of the statute.</p>
         <p>To say this is not to create a new kind of severability analysis. Post, at 291 (STEVENS,
            J., dissenting in part). Rather, it is to recognize that sometimes severability
            questions (questions as to how, or whether, Congress would intend a statute to apply)
            can arise when a legislatively unforeseen constitutional problem requires modification
            of a statutory provision as applied in a significant number of instances. Compare, e.
            g., Welsh v. United States, 398 U. S. 333, 361 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in result)
            (explaining that when a statute is defective because of its failure to extend to some
            group a constitutionally required benefit, the court may "either declare it a nullity"
            or "extend" the benefit "to include those who are aggrieved by exclusion"); Heckler v.
            Mathews, 465 U. S. 728, 739, n. 5 (1984) ("Although . . . ordinarily `extension, rather
            than nullification, is the proper course,' the court should not, of course, `use its
            remedial powers to circumvent the intent of the legislature . . . .'" (quoting Califano
            v. Westcott, 443 U. S. 76, 89 (1979) and id., at 94 (Powell, J., concurring in part and
            dissenting in part))); Sloan v. Lemon, 413 U. S. 825, 834 (1973) (striking down entire
            Pennsylvania tuition reimbursement statute because to eliminate only unconstitutional
            applications "would be to create a program quite different from the one the legislature
            actually adopted"). See also post, at 320, 323 (THOMAS, J., dissenting in part)
            ("[S]everability questions" can "arise from unconstitutional applications" of statutes,
            and such a question "is squarely presented" here); Vermeule, Saving Constructions, 85
            Geo. L. J. 1945, 1950, n. 26 (1997).</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*248</span> In today's context &#x97; a highly complex
            statute, interrelated provisions, and a constitutional requirement that creates
            fundamental change &#x97; we cannot assume that Congress, if faced with the statute's
            invalidity in key applications, would have preferred to apply the statute in as many
            other instances as possible. Neither can we determine likely congressional intent
            mechanically. We cannot simply approach the problem grammatically, say, by looking to
            see whether the constitutional requirement and the words of the Act are linguistically
            compatible.</p>
         <p>Nor do simple numbers provide an answer. It is, of course, true that the numbers show
            that the constitutional jury trial requirement would lead to additional decisionmaking
            by juries in only a minority of cases. See post, at 277 (STEVENS, J., dissenting in
            part). Prosecutors and defense attorneys would still resolve the lion's share of
            criminal matters through plea bargaining, and plea bargaining takes place without a
            jury. See ibid. Many of the rest involve only simple issues calling for no upward
            Guidelines adjustment. See post, at 275. And in at least some of the remainder, a judge
            may find adequate room to adjust a sentence within the single Guidelines range to which
            the jury verdict points, or within the overlap between that range and the next highest.
            See post, at 278-279.</p>
         <p>But the constitutional jury trial requirement would nonetheless affect every case. It
            would affect decisions about whether to go to trial. It would affect the content of plea
            negotiations. It would alter the judge's role in sentencing. Thus we must determine
            likely intent not by counting proceedings, but by evaluating the consequences of the
            Court's constitutional requirement in light of the Act's language, its history, and its
            basic purposes.</p>
         <p>While reasonable minds can, and do, differ about the outcome, we conclude that the
            constitutional jury trial requirement is not compatible with the Act as written and that
            some severance and excision are necessary. In Part II, infra, we <span
               class="star-pagination">*249</span> explain the incompatibility. In Part III, infra,
            we describe the necessary excision. In Part IV, infra, we explain why we have rejected
            other possibilities. In essence, in what follows, we explain both (1) why Congress would
            likely have preferred the total invalidation of the Act to an Act with the Court's Sixth
            Amendment requirement engrafted onto it, and (2) why Congress would likely have
            preferred the excision of some of the Act, namely the Act's mandatory language, to the
            invalidation of the entire Act. That is to say, in light of today's holding, we compare
            maintaining the Act as written with jury factfinding added (the dissenters' proposed
            remedy) to the total invalidation of the statute, and conclude that Congress would have
            preferred the latter. We then compare our own remedy to the total invalidation of the
            statute, and conclude that Congress would have preferred our remedy.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>Several considerations convince us that, were the Court's constitutional requirement
            added onto the Sentencing Act as currently written, the requirement would so transform
            the scheme that Congress created that Congress likely would not have intended the Act as
            so modified to stand. First, the statute's text states that "[t]he court" when
            sentencing will consider "the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history
            and characteristics of the defendant." 18 U. S. C. A. § 3553(a)(1) (main ed. and Supp.
            2004). In context, the words "the court" mean "the judge without the jury," not "the
            judge working together with the jury." A further statutory provision, by removing
            typical "jury trial" evidentiary limitations, makes this clear. See § 3661 (ruling out
            any "limitation . . . on the information concerning the [offender's] background,
            character, and conduct" that the "court . . . may receive"). The Act's history confirms
            it. See, e. g., S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 51 (1983) (the Guidelines system "will guide the
            judge in making" sentencing decisions (emphasis added)); id., at 52 (before sentencing,
            "the judge" <span class="star-pagination">*250</span> must consider "the nature and
            circumstances of the offense"); id., at 53 ("the judge" must conduct "a comprehensive
            examination of the characteristics of the particular offense and the particular
            offender").</p>
         <p>This provision is tied to the provision of the Act that makes the Guidelines mandatory,
            see § 3553(b)(1) (Supp. 2004). They are part and parcel of a single, unified whole
            &#x97; a whole that Congress intended to apply to all federal sentencing.</p>
         <p>This provision makes it difficult to justify JUSTICE STEVENS' approach, for that
            approach requires reading the words "the court" as if they meant "the judge working
            together with the jury." Unlike JUSTICE STEVENS, we do not believe we can interpret the
            statute's language to save its constitutionality, see post, at 286 (opinion dissenting
            in part), because we believe that any such reinterpretation, even if limited to
            instances in which a Sixth Amendment problem arises, would be "plainly contrary to the
            intent of Congress." United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 78 (1994).
            Without some such reinterpretation, however, this provision of the statute, along with
            those inextricably connected to it, are constitutionally invalid, and fall outside of
            Congress' power to enact. Nor can we agree with JUSTICE STEVENS that a newly passed
            "identical statute" would be valid, post, at 283 (opinion dissenting in part). Such a
            new, identically worded statute would be valid only if (unlike the present statute) we
            could interpret that new statute (without disregarding Congress' basic intent) as being
            consistent with the Court's jury factfinding requirement. Compare post, at 283-284
            (STEVENS, J., dissenting in part). If so, the statute would stand.</p>
         <p>Second, Congress' basic statutory goal &#x97; a system that diminishes sentencing
            disparity &#x97; depends for its success upon judicial efforts to determine, and to base
            punishment upon, the real conduct that underlies the crime of conviction. That
            determination is particularly important in the federal <span class="star-pagination"
               >*251</span> system where crimes defined as, for example, "obstruct[ing], delay[ing],
            or affect[ing] commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by . .
            . extortion," 18 U. S. C. § 1951(a), or, say, using the mail "for the purpose of
            executing" a "scheme or artifice to defraud," § 1341 (2000 ed., Supp. II), can encompass
            a vast range of very different kinds of underlying conduct. But it is also important
            even in respect to ordinary crimes, such as robbery, where an act that meets the
            statutory definition can be committed in a host of different ways. Judges have long
            looked to real conduct when sentencing. Federal judges have long relied upon a
            presentence report, prepared by a probation officer, for information (often unavailable
            until after the trial) relevant to the manner in which the convicted offender committed
            the crime of conviction.</p>
         <p>Congress expected this system to continue. That is why it specifically inserted into the
            Act the provision cited above, which (recodifying prior law) says that</p> "[n]o
         limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and
         conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive
         and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence." 18 U. S. C. § 3661.
            <p>This Court's earlier opinions assumed that this system would continue. That is why
            the Court, for example, held in United States v. Watts, 519 U. S. 148 (1997) (per
            curiam), that a sentencing judge could rely for sentencing purposes upon a fact that a
            jury had found unproved (beyond a reasonable doubt). See id., at 157; see also id., at
            152-153 (quoting United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 1B1.3,
            comment., backg'd (Nov. 1995) (USSG), which "describes in sweeping language the conduct
            that a sentencing court may consider in determining the applicable guideline range," and
            which provides that "`[c]onduct that is not formally charged or is not an element of the
            offense of conviction <span class="star-pagination">*252</span> may enter into the
            determination of the applicable guideline sentencing range'").</p>
         <p>The Sentencing Guidelines also assume that Congress intended this system to continue.
            See USSG § 1B1.3, comment., backg'd (Nov. 2003). That is why, among other things, they
            permit a judge to reject a plea-bargained sentence if he determines, after reviewing the
            presentence report, that the sentence does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the
            defendant's actual conduct. See § 6B1.2(a).</p>
         <p>To engraft the Court's constitutional requirement onto the sentencing statutes, however,
            would destroy the system. It would prevent a judge from relying upon a presentence
            report for factual information, relevant to sentencing, uncovered after the trial. In
            doing so, it would, even compared to pre-Guidelines sentencing, weaken the tie between a
            sentence and an offender's real conduct. It would thereby undermine the sentencing
            statute's basic aim of ensuring similar sentences for those who have committed similar
            crimes in similar ways.</p>
         <p>Several examples help illustrate the point. Imagine Smith and Jones, each of whom
            violates the Hobbs Act in very different ways. See 18 U. S. C. § 1951(a) (forbidding
            "obstruct[ing], delay[ing], or affect[ing] commerce or the movement of any article or
            commodity in commerce, by ... extortion"). Smith threatens to injure a co-worker unless
            the co-worker advances him a few dollars from the interstate company's till; Jones,
            after similarly threatening the co-worker, causes far more harm by seeking far more
            money, by making certain that the co-worker's family is aware of the threat, by
            arranging for deliveries of dead animals to the co-worker's home to show he is serious,
            and so forth. The offenders' behavior is very different; the known harmful consequences
            of their actions are different; their punishments both before, and after, the Guidelines
            would have been different. But, under the dissenters' approach, unless prosecutors
            decide to charge more than the elements of the crime, <span class="star-pagination"
               >*253</span> the judge would have to impose similar punishments. See, e. g., post, at
            303-304 (SCALIA, J., dissenting in part).</p>
         <p>Now imagine two former felons, Johnson and Jackson, each of whom engages in identical
            criminal behavior: threatening a bank teller with a gun, securing $50,000, and injuring
            an innocent bystander while fleeing the bank. Suppose prosecutors charge Johnson with
            one crime (say, illegal gun possession, see 18 U. S. C. § 922(g)) and Jackson with
            another (say, bank robbery, see § 2113(a)). Before the Guidelines, a single judge faced
            with such similar real conduct would have been able (within statutory limits) to impose
            similar sentences upon the two similar offenders despite the different charges brought
            against them. The Guidelines themselves would ordinarily have required judges to
            sentence the two offenders similarly. But under the dissenters' system, in these
            circumstances the offenders likely would receive different punishments. See, e. g.,
            post, at 303-304 (SCALIA, J., dissenting in part).</p>
         <p>Consider, too, a complex mail fraud conspiracy where a prosecutor may well be uncertain
            of the amount of harm and of the role each indicted individual played until after
            conviction &#x97; when the offenders may turn over financial records, when it becomes
            easier to determine who were the leaders and who the followers, when victim interviews
            are seen to be worth the time. In such a case the relation between the sentence and what
            actually occurred is likely to be considerably more distant under a system with a jury
            trial requirement patched onto it than it was even prior to the Sentencing Act, when
            judges routinely used information obtained after the verdict to decide upon a proper
            sentence.</p>
         <p>This point is critically important. Congress' basic goal in passing the Sentencing Act
            was to move the sentencing system in the direction of increased uniformity. See 28 U. S.
            C. § 991(b)(1)(B); see also § 994(f). That uniformity does not consist simply of similar
            sentences for those convicted of violations of the same statute &#x97; a uniformity
            consistent with the <span class="star-pagination">*254</span> dissenters' remedial
            approach. It consists, more importantly, of similar relationships between sentences and
            real conduct, relationships that Congress' sentencing statutes helped to advance and
            that JUSTICE STEVENS' approach would undermine. Compare post, at 288 (opinion dissenting
            in part) (conceding that the Sixth Amendment requirement would "undoubtedly affect `real
            conduct' sentencing in certain cases," but minimizing the significance of that
            circumstance). In significant part, it is the weakening of this
            real-conduct/uniformity-in-sentencing relationship, and not any "[i]nexplicabl[e]"
            concerns for the "manner of achieving uniform sentences," post, at 304 (SCALIA, J.,
            dissenting in part), that leads us to conclude that Congress would have preferred no
            mandatory system to the system the dissenters envisage.</p>
         <p>Third, the sentencing statutes, read to include the Court's Sixth Amendment requirement,
            would create a system far more complex than Congress could have intended. How would
            courts and counsel work with an indictment and a jury trial that involved not just
            whether a defendant robbed a bank but also how? Would the indictment have to allege, in
            addition to the elements of robbery, whether the defendant possessed a firearm, whether
            he brandished or discharged it, whether he threatened death, whether he caused bodily
            injury, whether any such injury was ordinary, serious, permanent or life threatening,
            whether he abducted or physically restrained anyone, whether any victim was unusually
            vulnerable, how much money was taken, and whether he was an organizer, leader, manager,
            or supervisor in a robbery gang? See USSG §§ 2B3.1, 3B1.1. If so, how could a defendant
            mount a defense against some or all such specific claims should he also try
            simultaneously to maintain that the Government's evidence failed to place him at the
            scene of the crime? Would the indictment in a mail fraud case have to allege the number
            of victims, their vulnerability, and the amount taken from each? How could a judge
            expect a jury to work with the Guidelines' definitions of, say, "relevant conduct,"
               <span class="star-pagination">*255</span> which includes "all acts and omissions
            committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused
            by the defendant; and [in the case of a conspiracy] all reasonably foreseeable acts and
            omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity"? §§
            1B1.3(a)(1)(A)-(B). How would a jury measure "loss" in a securities fraud case &#x97; a
            matter so complex as to lead the Commission to instruct judges to make "only ... a
            reasonable estimate"? § 2B1.1, comment., n. 3(C). How would the court take account, for
            punishment purposes, of a defendant's contemptuous behavior at trial &#x97; a matter
            that the Government could not have charged in the indictment? § 3C1.1.</p>
         <p>Fourth, plea bargaining would not significantly diminish the consequences of the Court's
            constitutional holding for the operation of the Guidelines. Compare post, at 273-274
            (STEVENS, J., dissenting in part). Rather, plea bargaining would make matters worse.
            Congress enacted the sentencing statutes in major part to achieve greater uniformity in
            sentencing, i. e., to increase the likelihood that offenders who engage in similar real
            conduct would receive similar sentences. The statutes reasonably assume that their
            efforts to move the trial-based sentencing process in the direction of greater
            sentencing uniformity would have a similar positive impact upon plea-bargained
            sentences, for plea bargaining takes place in the shadow of (i. e., with an eye towards
            the hypothetical result of) a potential trial.</p>
         <p>That, too, is why Congress, understanding the realities of plea bargaining, authorized
            the Commission to promulgate policy statements that would assist sentencing judges in
            determining whether to reject a plea agreement after reading about the defendant's real
            conduct in a presentence report (and giving the offender an opportunity to challenge the
            report). See 28 U. S. C. § 994(a)(2)(E); USSG § 6B1.2(a), p. s. This system has not
            worked perfectly; judges have often simply accepted an agreed-upon account of the
            conduct at <span class="star-pagination">*256</span> issue. But compared to pre-existing
            law, the statutes try to move the system in the right direction, i. e., toward greater
            sentencing uniformity.</p>
         <p>The Court's constitutional jury trial requirement, however, if patched onto the present
            Sentencing Act, would move the system backwards in respect both to tried and to
            plea-bargained cases. In respect to tried cases, it would effectively deprive the judge
            of the ability to use post-verdict-acquired real-conduct information; it would prohibit
            the judge from basing a sentence upon any conduct other than the conduct the prosecutor
            chose to charge; and it would put a defendant to a set of difficult strategic choices as
            to which prosecutorial claims he would contest. The sentence that would emerge in a case
            tried under such a system would likely reflect real conduct less completely, less
            accurately, and less often than did a pre-Guidelines, as well as a Guidelines,
            trial.</p>
         <p>Because plea bargaining inevitably reflects estimates of what would happen at trial,
            plea bargaining too under such a system would move in the wrong direction. That is to
            say, in a sentencing system modified by the Court's constitutional requirement, plea
            bargaining would likely lead to sentences that gave greater weight not to real conduct,
            but rather to the skill of counsel, the policies of the prosecutor, the case-load, and
            other factors that vary from place to place, defendant to defendant, and crime to crime.
            Compared to pre-Guidelines plea bargaining, plea bargaining of this kind would
            necessarily move federal sentencing in the direction of diminished, not increased,
            uniformity in sentencing. Compare supra, at 250-252, with post, at 288 (STEVENS, J.,
            dissenting in part). It would tend to defeat, not to further, Congress' basic statutory
            goal.</p>
         <p>Such a system would have particularly troubling consequences with respect to
            prosecutorial power. Until now, sentencing factors have come before the judge in the
            presentence report. But in a sentencing system with the Court's <span
               class="star-pagination">*257</span> constitutional requirement engrafted onto it, any
            factor that a prosecutor chose not to charge at the plea negotiation would be placed
            beyond the reach of the judge entirely. Prosecutors would thus exercise a power the
            Sentencing Act vested in judges: the power to decide, based on relevant information
            about the offense and the offender, which defendants merit heavier punishment.</p>
         <p>In respondent Booker's case, for example, the jury heard evidence that the crime had
            involved 92.5 grams of crack cocaine, and convicted Booker of possessing more than 50
            grams. But the judge, at sentencing, found that the crime had involved an additional 566
            grams, for a total of 658.5 grams. A system that would require the jury, not the judge,
            to make the additional "566 grams" finding is a system in which the prosecutor, not the
            judge, would control the sentence. That is because it is the prosecutor who would have
            to decide what drug amount to charge. He could choose to charge 658.5 grams, or 92.5, or
            less. It is the prosecutor who, through such a charging decision, would control the
            sentencing range. And it is different prosecutors who, in different cases &#x97; say, in
            two cases involving 566 grams &#x97; would potentially insist upon different punishments
            for similar defendants who engaged in similar criminal conduct involving similar amounts
            of unlawful drugs &#x97; say, by charging one of them with the full 566 grams, and the
            other with 10. As long as different prosecutors react differently, a system with a
            patched-on jury factfinding requirement would mean different sentences for otherwise
            similar conduct, whether in the context of trials or that of plea bargaining.</p>
         <p>Fifth, Congress would not have enacted sentencing statutes that make it more difficult
            to adjust sentences upward than to adjust them downward. As several United States
            Senators have written in an amicus brief, "the Congress that enacted the 1984 Act did
            not conceive of &#x97; much less establish &#x97; a sentencing guidelines system in
            which sentencing judges were free to consider facts or circumstances not found <span
               class="star-pagination">*258</span> by a jury or admitted in a plea agreement for the
            purpose of adjusting a base-offense level down, but not up, within the applicable
            guidelines range. Such a one-way lever would be grossly at odds with Congress's intent."
            Brief for Sen. Orrin G. Hatch et al. as Amici Curiae 22. Yet that is the system that the
            dissenters' remedy would create. Compare post, at 291 (STEVENS, J., dissenting in part)
            (conceding asymmetry but stating belief that this "is unlikely to have more than a
            minimal effect").</p>
         <p>For all these reasons, Congress, had it been faced with the constitutional jury trial
            requirement, likely would not have passed the same Sentencing Act. It likely would have
            found the requirement incompatible with the Act as written. Hence the Act cannot remain
            valid in its entirety. Severance and excision are necessary.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>We now turn to the question of which portions of the sentencing statute we must sever
            and excise as inconsistent with the Court's constitutional requirement. Although, as we
            have explained, see Part II, supra, we believe that Congress would have preferred the
            total invalidation of the statute to the dissenters' remedial approach, we nevertheless
            do not believe that the entire statute must be invalidated. Compare post, at 292
            (STEVENS, J., dissenting in part). Most of the statute is perfectly valid. See, e.g., 18
            U. S. C. A. § 3551 (main ed. and Supp. 2004) (describing authorized sentences as
            probation, fine, or imprisonment); § 3552 (presentence reports); § 3554 (forfeiture); §
            3555 (notification to the victims); § 3583 (supervised release). And we must "refrain
            from invalidating more of the statute than is necessary." Regan, 468 U.S., at 652
            (plurality opinion). Indeed, we must retain those portions of the Act that are (1)
            constitutionally valid, id., at 652-653, (2) capable of "functioning independently,"
            Alaska Airlines, 480 U. S., at 684, <span class="star-pagination">*259</span> and (3)
            consistent with Congress' basic objectives in enacting the statute, Regan, supra, at
            653.</p>
         <p>Application of these criteria indicates that we must sever and excise two specific
            statutory provisions: the provision that requires sentencing courts to impose a sentence
            within the applicable Guidelines range (in the absence of circumstances that justify a
            departure), see 18 U. S. C. A. § 3553(b)(1) (Supp. 2004), and the provision that sets
            forth standards of review on appeal, including de novo review of departures from the
            applicable Guidelines range, see § 3742(e) (main ed. and Supp. 2004) (see Appendix,
            infra, for text of both provisions). With these two sections excised (and statutory
            cross-references to the two sections consequently invalidated), the remainder of the Act
            satisfies the Court's constitutional requirements.</p>
         <p>As the Court today recognizes in its first opinion in these cases, the existence of §
            3553(b)(1) is a necessary condition of the constitutional violation. That is to say,
            without this provision &#x97; namely the provision that makes "the relevant sentencing
            rules . . . mandatory and impose[s] binding requirements on all sentencing judges"
            &#x97; the statute falls outside the scope of Apprendi's requirement. Ante, at 233
            (STEVENS, J., opinion of the Court); see also ibid. ("[E]veryone agrees that the
            constitutional issues presented by these cases would have been avoided entirely if
            Congress had omitted from the [Sentencing Reform Act] the provisions that make the
            Guidelines binding on district judges"). Cf. post, at 314-320 (THOMAS, J., dissenting in
            part).</p>
         <p>The remainder of the Act "function[s] independently." Alaska Airlines, supra, at 684.
            Without the "mandatory" provision, the Act nonetheless requires judges to take account
            of the Guidelines together with other sentencing goals. See 18 U. S. C. A. § 3553(a)
            (Supp. 2004). The Act nonetheless requires judges to consider the Guidelines "sentencing
            range established for . . . the applicable category of offense committed by the
            applicable category of defendant," <span class="star-pagination">*260</span> §
            3553(a)(4)(A), the pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements, the need to avoid
            unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims, §§
            3553(a)(1), (3), (5)-(7) (main ed. and Supp. 2004). And the Act nonetheless requires
            judges to impose sentences that reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect
            for the law, provide just punishment, afford adequate deterrence, protect the public,
            and effectively provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training and
            medical care. § 3553(a)(2) (main ed. and Supp. 2004) (see Appendix, infra, for text of §
            3553(a)).</p>
         <p>Moreover, despite the absence of § 3553(b)(1) (Supp. 2004), the Act continues to provide
            for appeals from sentencing decisions (irrespective of whether the trial judge sentences
            within or outside the Guidelines range in the exercise of his discretionary power under
            § 3553(a)). See § 3742(a) (appeal by defendant); § 3742(b) (appeal by Government). We
            concede that the excision of § 3553(b)(1) requires the excision of a different,
            appeals-related section, namely § 3742(e) (main ed. and Supp. 2004), which sets forth
            standards of review on appeal. That section contains critical cross-references to the
            (now-excised) § 3553(b)(1) and consequently must be severed and excised for similar
            reasons.</p>
         <p>Excision of § 3742(e), however, does not pose a critical problem for the handling of
            appeals. That is because, as we have previously held, a statute that does not explicitly
            set forth a standard of review may nonetheless do so implicitly. See Pierce v.
            Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 558-560 (1988) (adopting a standard of review, where "neither
            a clear statutory prescription nor a historical tradition" existed, based on the
            statutory text and structure, and on practical considerations); see also Cooter
            &amp;amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384, 403-405 (1990) (same); Koon v. United
            States, 518 U. S. 81, 99 (1996) (citing Pierce and Cooter &amp;amp; Gell with approval).
            We infer appropriate review standards from related statutory language, the structure of
            the statute, and the "`sound <span class="star-pagination">*261</span> administration of
            justice.'" Pierce, supra, at 559-560. And in this instance those factors, in addition to
            the past two decades of appellate practice in cases involving departures, imply a
            practical standard of review already familiar to appellate courts: review for
            "unreasonable[ness]." 18 U. S. C. § 3742(e)(3) (1994 ed.).</p>
         <p>Until 2003, § 3742(e) explicitly set forth that standard. See § 3742(e)(3) (1994 ed.).
            In 2003, Congress modified the pre-existing text, adding a de novo standard of review
            for departures and inserting cross-references to § 3553(b)(1). Prosecutorial Remedies
            and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003, Pub. L. 108-21, §
            401(d)(1), 117 Stat. 670. In light of today's holding, the reasons for these revisions
            &#x97; to make Guidelines sentencing even more mandatory than it had been &#x97; have
            ceased to be relevant. The pre-2003 text directed appellate courts to review sentences
            that reflected an applicable Guidelines range for correctness, but to review other
            sentences &#x97; those that fell "outside the applicable Guideline range" &#x97; with a
            view toward determining whether such a sentence</p> "is unreasonable, having regard for
         ... the factors to be considered in imposing a sentence, as set forth in chapter 227 of
         this title; and . . . the reasons for the imposition of the particular sentence, as stated
         by the district court pursuant to the provisions of section 3553(c)." 18 U. S. C. §
         3742(e)(3) (1994 ed.) (emphasis added). <p>In other words, the text told appellate courts
            to determine whether the sentence "is unreasonable" with regard to § 3553(a). Section
            3553(a) remains in effect, and sets forth numerous factors that guide sentencing. Those
            factors in turn will guide appellate courts, as they have in the past, in determining
            whether a sentence is unreasonable.</p>
         <p>Taking into account the factors set forth in Pierce, we read the statute as implying
            this appellate review standard &#x97; a <span class="star-pagination">*262</span>
            standard consistent with appellate sentencing practice during the last two decades.
            JUSTICE SCALIA believes that only in "Wonderland" is it possible to infer a standard of
            review after excising § 3742(e). See post, at 309 (opinion dissenting in part). But our
            application of Pierce does not justify that characterization. Pierce requires us to
            judge the appropriateness of our inference based on the statute's language and basic
            purposes. We believe our inference a fair one linguistically, and one consistent with
            Congress' intent to provide appellate review. Under these circumstances, to refuse to
            apply Pierce and thereby retreat to a remedy that raises the problems discussed in Part
            II, supra (as the dissenters would do), or thereby eliminate appellate review entirely,
            would cut the statute loose from its moorings in congressional purpose.</p>
         <p>Nor do we share the dissenters' doubts about the practicality of a "reasonableness"
            standard of review. "Reasonableness" standards are not foreign to sentencing law. The
            Act has long required their use in important sentencing circumstances &#x97; both on
            review of departures, see 18 U. S. C. § 3742(e)(3) (1994 ed.), and on review of
            sentences imposed where there was no applicable Guideline, see §§ 3742(a)(4), (b)(4),
            (e)(4). Together, these cases account for about 16.7% of sentencing appeals. See United
            States Sentencing Commission, 2002 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics 107, n.
            1, 111 (at least 711 of 5,018 sentencing appeals involved departures), 108 (at least 126
            of 5,018 sentencing appeals involved the imposition of a term of imprisonment after the
            revocation of supervised release). See also, e. g., United States v. White Face, 383 F.
            3d 733, 737-740 (CA8 2004); United States v. Tsosie, 376 F. 3d 1210, 1218-1219 (CA10
            2004); United States v. Salinas, 365 F. 3d 582, 588-590 (CA7 2004); United States v.
            Cook, 291 F. 3d 1297, 1300-1302 (CA11 2002 (per curiam); United States v. Olabanji, 268
            F. 3d 636, 637-639 (CA9 2001); United States v. Ramirez-Rivera, 241 F. 3d 37, 40-41 (CA1
            2001). That is why we think it fair (and not, in JUSTICE SCALIA's words, a "gross
            exaggeratio[n]," <span class="star-pagination">*263</span> post, at 311 (opinion
            dissenting in part)), to assume judicial familiarity with a "reasonableness" standard.
            And that is why we believe that appellate judges will prove capable of facing with
            greater equanimity than would JUSTICE SCALIA what he calls the "daunting prospect,"
            post, at 312, of applying such a standard across the board.</p>
         <p>Neither do we share JUSTICE SCALIA's belief that use of a reasonableness standard "will
            produce a discordant symphony" leading to "excessive sentencing disparities," and "wreak
            havoc" on the judicial system, post, at 312-313 (internal quotation marks omitted). The
            Sentencing Commission will continue to collect and study appellate court
            decision-making. It will continue to modify its Guidelines in light of what it learns,
            thereby encouraging what it finds to be better sentencing practices. It will thereby
            promote uniformity in the sentencing process. 28 U. S. C. A. § 994 (main ed. and Supp.
            2004).</p>
         <p>Regardless, in this context, we must view fears of a "discordant symphony," "excessive
            disparities," and "havoc" (if they are not themselves "gross exaggerations") with a
            comparative eye. We cannot and do not claim that use of a "reasonableness" standard will
            provide the uniformity that Congress originally sought to secure. Nor do we doubt that
            Congress wrote the language of the appellate provisions to correspond with the mandatory
            system it intended to create. Compare post, at 306-307 (SCALIA, J., dissenting in part)
            (expressing concern regarding the presence of § 3742(f) in light of the absence of §
            3742(e)). But, as by now should be clear, that mandatory system is no longer an open
            choice. And the remedial question we must ask here (as we did in respect to §
            3553(b)(1)) is, which alternative adheres more closely to Congress' original objective:
            (1) retention of sentencing appeals, or (2) invalidation of the entire Act, including
            its appellate provisions? The former, by providing appellate review, would tend to iron
            out sentencing differences; the latter would not. Hence we believe Congress would have
            preferred <span class="star-pagination">*264</span> the former to the latter &#x97; even
            if the former means that some provisions will apply differently from the way Congress
            had originally expected. See post, at 306-307 (SCALIA, J., dissenting in part). But, as
            we have said, we believe that Congress would have preferred even the latter to the
            system the dissenters recommend, a system that has its own problems of practicality. See
            supra, at 254-256.</p>
         <p>Finally, the Act without its "mandatory" provision and related language remains
            consistent with Congress' initial and basic sentencing intent. Congress sought to
            "provide certainty and fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing, [while] avoiding
            unwarranted sentencing disparities ... [and] maintaining sufficient flexibility to
            permit individualized sentences when warranted." 28 U.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B); see also USSG
            § 1A1.1, application note (explaining that Congress sought to achieve "honesty,"
            "uniformity," and "proportionality" in sentencing (emphases deleted)). The system
            remaining after excision, while lacking the mandatory features that Congress enacted,
            retains other features that help to further these objectives.</p>
         <p>As we have said, the Sentencing Commission remains in place, writing Guidelines,
            collecting information about actual district court sentencing decisions, undertaking
            research, and revising the Guidelines accordingly. See 28 U. S. C. A. § 994 (main ed.
            and Supp. 2004). The district courts, while not bound to apply the Guidelines, must
            consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing. See 18 U. S. C. A.
            §§ 3553(a)(4), (5)(Supp. 2004). But compare post, at 305 (SCALIA, J., dissenting in
            part) (claiming that the sentencing judge has the same discretion "he possessed before
            the Act was passed"). The courts of appeals review sentencing decisions for
            unreasonableness. These features of the remaining system, while not the system Congress
            enacted, nonetheless continue to move sentencing in Congress' preferred direction,
            helping to avoid excessive sentencing disparities while maintaining flexibility
            sufficient to <span class="star-pagination">*265</span> individualize sentences where
            necessary. See 28 U. S. C. § 991(b). We can find no feature of the remaining system that
            tends to hinder, rather than to further, these basic objectives. Under these
            circumstances, why would Congress not have preferred excision of the "mandatory"
            provision to a system that engrafts today's constitutional requirement onto the
            unchanged pre-existing statute &#x97; a system that, in terms of Congress' basic
            objectives, is counterproductive?</p>
         <p>We do not doubt that Congress, when it wrote the Sentencing Act, intended to create a
            form of mandatory Guidelines system. See post, at 291-296 (STEVENS, J., dissenting in
            part). But, we repeat, given today's constitutional holding, that is not a choice that
            remains open. Hence we have examined the statute in depth to determine Congress' likely
            intent in light of today's holding. See, e. g., Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications
            Consortium, Inc., 518 U. S., at 767. And we have concluded that today's holding is
            fundamentally inconsistent with the judge-based sentencing system that Congress enacted
            into law. In our view, it is more consistent with Congress' likely intent in enacting
            the Sentencing Reform Act (1) to preserve important elements of that system while
            severing and excising two provisions (§§ 3553(b)(1) and 3742(e)) than (2) to maintain
            all provisions of the Act and engraft today's constitutional requirement onto that
            statutory scheme.</p>
         <p>Ours, of course, is not the last word: The ball now lies in Congress' court. The
            National Legislature is equipped to devise and install, long term, the sentencing
            system, compatible with the Constitution, that Congress judges best for the federal
            system of justice.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>IV</h2>
         <p>We briefly explain why we have not fully adopted the remedial proposals that the parties
            have advanced. First, the Government argues that "in any case in which the Constitution
            prohibits the judicial factfinding procedures that Congress and the Commission
            contemplated for implementing <span class="star-pagination">*266</span> the Guidelines,
            the Guidelines as a whole become inapplicable." Brief for United States in No. 04-104,
            p. 44. Thus the Guidelines "system contemplated by Congress and created by the
            Commission would be inapplicable in a case in which the Guidelines would require the
            sentencing court to find a sentence-enhancing fact." Id., at 66-67. The Guidelines would
            remain advisory, however, for § 3553(a) would remain intact. Ibid. Cf. Brief for New
            York Council of Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 15, n. 9 (A "decision that Section
            3553(b) ... is unconstitutional ... would not necessarily jeopardize the other reforms
            made by the Sentencing Reform Act, including ... 18 U. S. C. § 3553(a)"); see also ibid.
            (recognizing that the remainder of the Act functions independently); Brief for Families
            Against Mandatory Minimums as Amicus Curiae 29, 30.</p>
         <p>As we understand the Government's remedial suggestion, it coincides significantly with
            our own. But compare post, at 282 (STEVENS, J., dissenting in part) (asserting that no
            party or amicus sought the remedy we adopt); post, at 309 (SCALIA, J., dissenting in
            part) (same). The Government would render the Guidelines advisory in "any case in which
            the Constitution prohibits" judicial factfinding. But it apparently would leave them as
            binding in all other cases.</p>
         <p>We agree with the first part of the Government's suggestion. However, we do not see how
            it is possible to leave the Guidelines as binding in other cases. For one thing, the
            Government's proposal would impose mandatory Guidelines-type limits upon a judge's
            ability to reduce sentences, but it would not impose those limits upon a judge's ability
            to increase sentences. We do not believe that such "one-way lever[s]" are compatible
            with Congress' intent. Cf. Brief for Sen. Orrin G. Hatch et al. as Amici Curiae 22; see
            also supra, at 253-254. For another, we believe that Congress would not have authorized
            a mandatory system in some cases and a nonmandatory system in others, given the
            administrative complexities that such a system would create. <span
               class="star-pagination">*267</span> Such a two-system proposal seems unlikely to
            further Congress' basic objective of promoting uniformity in sentencing.</p>
         <p>Second, the respondents in essence would take the same approach as would JUSTICE
            STEVENS. They believe that the constitutional requirement is compatible with the
            Sentencing Act, and they ask us to hold that the Act continues to stand as written with
            the constitutional requirement engrafted onto it. We do not accept their position for
            the reasons we have already given. See Part II, supra.</p>
         <p>Respondent Fanfan argues in the alternative that we should excise those provisions of
            the Sentencing Act that require judicial factfinding at sentencing. That system,
            however, would produce problems similar to those we have discussed in Part II, supra. We
            reject Fanfan's remedial suggestion for that reason.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>V</h2>
         <p>In respondent Booker's case, the District Court applied the Guidelines as written and
            imposed a sentence higher than the maximum authorized solely by the jury's verdict. The
            Court of Appeals held Blakely applicable to the Guidelines, concluded that Booker's
            sentence violated the Sixth Amendment, vacated the judgment of the District Court, and
            remanded for resentencing. We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the
            case. On remand, the District Court should impose a sentence in accordance with today's
            opinions, and, if the sentence comes before the Court of Appeals for review, the Court
            of Appeals should apply the review standards set forth in this opinion.</p>
         <p>In respondent Fanfan's case, the District Court held Blakely applicable to the
            Guidelines. It then imposed a sentence that was authorized by the jury's verdict &#x97;
            a sentence lower than the sentence authorized by the Guidelines as written. Thus,
            Fanfan's sentence does not violate the Sixth Amendment. Nonetheless, the Government (and
            the defendant should he so choose) may seek resentencing under the system set forth in
            today's opinions. Hence we vacate <span class="star-pagination">*268</span> the judgment
            of the District Court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this
            opinion.</p>
         <p>As these dispositions indicate, we must apply today's holdings &#x97; both the Sixth
            Amendment holding and our remedial interpretation of the Sentencing Act &#x97; to all
            cases on direct review. See Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 328 (1987) ("[A] new
            rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all
            cases ... pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in
            which the new rule constitutes a `clear break' with the past"). See also Reynoldsville
            Casket Co. v. Hyde, 514 U. S. 749, 752 (1995) (civil case); Harper v. Virginia Dept. of
            Taxation, 509 U. S. 86, 97 (1993) (same). That fact does not mean that we believe that
            every sentence gives rise to a Sixth Amendment violation. Nor do we believe that every
            appeal will lead to a new sentencing hearing. That is because we expect reviewing courts
            to apply ordinary prudential doctrines, determining, for example, whether the issue was
            raised below and whether it fails the "plain-error" test. It is also because, in cases
            not involving a Sixth Amendment violation, whether resentencing is warranted or whether
            it will instead be sufficient to review a sentence for reasonableness may depend upon
            application of the harmless-error doctrine.</p>
         <p>It is so ordered.</p>
         <p/>

            <span class="star-pagination">*272</span> JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER
            joins, and with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins except for Part III and footnote 17,
            dissenting in part.</p>
         <p>Neither of the two Court opinions that decide these cases finds any constitutional
            infirmity inherent in any provision of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA) or the
            Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Specifically, neither 18 U. S. C. A. § 3553(b)(1) (Supp.
            2004), which makes application of the Guidelines mandatory, nor § 3742(e) (main ed. and
            Supp. 2004), which authorizes appellate review of departures from the Guidelines, is
            even arguably unconstitutional. Neither the Government, nor the respondents, nor any of
            the numerous amici has suggested that there is any need to invalidate either provision
            in order to avoid violations of the Sixth Amendment in the administration of the
            Guidelines. The Court's decision to do so represents a policy choice that Congress has
            considered and decisively rejected. While it is perfectly clear that Congress has ample
            power to repeal these two statutory provisions if it so desires, this Court should not
            make that choice on Congress' behalf. I respectfully dissent from the Court's
            extraordinary exercise of authority.</p>
         <p>Before explaining why the law does not authorize the Court's creative remedy, why the
            reasons it advances in support of its decision are unpersuasive, and why it is
            abundantly clear that Congress has already rejected that very remedy, it is appropriate
            to explain how the violation of the Sixth Amendment that occurred in Booker's case could
            readily have been avoided without making any change in the Guidelines. Booker received a
            sentence of 360 months' imprisonment. His sentence was based on four factual
            determinations: (1) the jury's finding that he possessed 92.5 grams of crack (cocaine
            base); (2) the judge's finding that he possessed an additional 566 grams; (3) the
            judge's conclusion that he had obstructed justice; and (4) the judge's evaluation of his
            prior criminal record. Under the jury's 92.5 grams finding, the maximum sentence
            authorized by the Guidelines <span class="star-pagination">*273</span> was a term of 262
            months. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 2D1.1(c)(4) (Nov.
            2003) (USSG).</p>
         <p>If the 566 gram finding had been made by the jury based on proof beyond a reasonable
            doubt, that finding would have authorized a Guidelines sentence anywhere between 324 and
            405 months &#x97; the equivalent of a range from 27 to nearly 34 years &#x97; given
            Booker's criminal history. § 2D1.1(c)(2). Relying on his own appraisal of the
            defendant's obstruction of justice, and presumably any other information in the
            presentence report, the judge would have had discretion to select any sentence within
            that range. Thus, if the two facts, which in this case actually established two separate
            crimes, had both been found by the jury, the judicial factfinding that produced the
            actual sentence would not have violated the Constitution. In other words, the judge
            could have considered Booker's obstruction of justice, his criminal history, and all
            other real offense and offender factors without violating the Sixth Amendment. Because
            the Guidelines as written possess the virtue of combining a mandatory determination of
            sentencing ranges and discretionary decisions within those ranges, they allow ample
            latitude for judicial factfinding that does not even arguably raise any Sixth Amendment
            issue.</p>
         <p>The principal basis for the Court's chosen remedy is its assumption that Congress did
            not contemplate that the Sixth Amendment would be violated by depriving the defendant of
            the right to a jury trial on a factual issue as important as whether Booker possessed
            the additional 566 grams of crack that exponentially increased the maximum sentence that
            he could receive. I am not at all sure that that assumption is correct, but even if it
            is, it does not provide an adequate basis for volunteering a systemwide remedy that
            Congress has already rejected and could enact on its own if it elected to.</p>
         <p>When one pauses to note that over 95% of all federal criminal prosecutions are
            terminated by a plea bargain, and the <span class="star-pagination">*274</span> further
            fact that in almost half of the cases that go to trial there are no sentencing
            enhancements, the extraordinary overbreadth of the Court's unprecedented remedy is
            manifest. It is, moreover, unique because, under the Court's reasoning, if Congress
            should decide to reenact the exact text of the two provisions that the Court has chosen
            to invalidate, that reenactment would be unquestionably constitutional. In my judgment,
            it is therefore clear that the Court's creative remedy is an exercise of legislative,
            rather than judicial, power.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>It is a fundamental premise of judicial review that all Acts of Congress are
            presumptively valid. See Regan v. Time, Inc., 468 U. S. 641, 652 (1984). "A ruling of
            unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the elected representatives of the people."
            Ibid. In the past, because of its respect for the coordinate branches of Government, the
            Court has invalidated duly enacted statutes &#x97; or particular provisions of such
            statutes &#x97; "only upon a plain showing that Congress has exceeded its constitutional
            bounds." United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 607 (2000); see also El Paso
            &amp;amp; Northeastern R. Co. v. Gutierrez, 215 U. S. 87, 97 (1909). The exercise of
            such power is traditionally limited to issues presented in the case or controversy
            before the Court, and to the imposition of remedies that redress specific constitutional
            violations.</p>
         <p>There are two narrow exceptions to this general rule. A facial challenge may succeed if
            a legislative scheme is unconstitutional in all or nearly all of its applications. That
            is certainly not true in these cases, however, because most applications of the
            Guidelines are unquestionably valid. A second exception involves cases in which an
            invalid provision or application cannot be severed from the remainder of the statute.
            That exception is inapplicable because there is no statutory or Guidelines provision
            that is invalid. Neither exception supports the majority's newly minted remedy.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>
            <span class="star-pagination">*275</span>
            <i>Facial Invalidity:</i>
         </h2>
         <p>Regardless of how the Court defines the standard for determining when a facial challenge
            to a statute should succeed,<span class="sup">[1]</span> it is abundantly clear that the
            fact that a statute, or any provision of a statute, is unconstitutional in a portion of
            its applications does not render the statute or provision invalid, and no party suggests
            otherwise. The Government conceded at oral argument that 45% of federal sentences
            involve no enhancements. Cf. United States Sentencing Commission, 2002 Sourcebook of
            Federal Sentencing Statistics 39-40 (hereinafter Sourcebook).<span class="sup"
               >[2]</span> And, according to two U. S. Sentencing Commissioners who testified before
            Congress shortly after we handed down our decision in Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S.
            296 (2004), the number of enhancements that would actually implicate a defendant's Sixth
            Amendment rights is even smaller. See Hearings on Blakely v. Washington and the Future
            of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 108th
            Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (2004) (hereinafter Hearings on Blakely) (testimony of Commissioners
            John R. Steer and Hon. William K. Sessions III) ("[A] majority of the cases sentenced
            under the federal guidelines do not receive sentencing enhancements that could
            potentially implicate Blakely"), available at
            http://www.ussc.gov/hearings/BlakelyTest.pdf (all Internet materials as visited Jan. 7,
            2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). Simply stated, the Government's
               <span class="star-pagination">*276</span> submissions to this Court and to Congress
            demonstrate that the Guidelines could be constitutionally applied in their entirety,
            without any modifications, in the "majority of the cases sentenced under the federal
            guidelines." Ibid. On the basis of these submissions alone, this Court should have
            declined to find the Guidelines, or any particular provisions of the Guidelines,
            facially invalid.<span class="sup">[3]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Accordingly, the majority's claim that a jury factfinding requirement would "destroy the
            system," ante, at 252 (opinion of BREYER, J.), would at most apply to a minority of
            sentences imposed under the Guidelines. In reality, given that the Government and judges
            have been apprised of the requirements of the Sixth Amendment, the number of
            unconstitutional applications would have been even smaller had we allowed them the
            opportunity to comply with our constitutional holding. This is so for several
            reasons.</p>
         <p>First, it is axiomatic that a defendant may waive his Sixth Amendment right to trial by
            jury. Patton v. United States, 281 U. S. 276, 312-313 (1930). In Blakely we explained
            that "[w]hen a defendant pleads guilty, the State is free to seek judicial sentence
            enhancements so long as the defendant <span class="star-pagination">*277</span> either
            stipulates to the relevant facts or consents to judicial factfinding." 542 U. S., at
            310. Such reasoning applies with equal force to sentences imposed under the Guidelines.
            As the majority concedes, ante, at 248, only a tiny fraction of federal prosecutions
            ever go to trial. See Estimate, at 2 ("In FY02, 97.1 percent of cases sentenced under
            the guidelines were the result of plea agreements"). If such procedures were followed in
            the future, our holding that Blakely applies to the Guidelines would be consequential
            only in the tiny portion of prospective sentencing decisions that are made after a
            defendant has been found guilty by a jury.</p>
         <p>Second, in the remaining fraction of cases that result in a jury trial, I am confident
            that those charged with complying with the Guidelines &#x97; judges, aided by
            prosecutors and defense attorneys &#x97; could adequately protect defendants' Sixth
            Amendment rights without this Court's extraordinary remedy. In many cases, prosecutors
            could avoid an Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), problem simply by alleging
            in the indictment the facts necessary to reach the chosen Guidelines sentence. Following
            our decision in Apprendi, and again after our decision in Blakely, the Department of
            Justice advised federal prosecutors to adopt practices that would enable them "to charge
            and prove to the jury facts that increase the statutory maximum &#x97; for example, drug
            type and quantity for offenses under 21 U. S. C. 841."<span class="sup">[4]</span>
            Enhancing the specificity of indictments would be a simple matter, for example, in
            prosecutions under the federal drug statutes (such as Booker's prosecution). The
            Government has already directed its prosecutors to allege facts such as the <span
               class="star-pagination">*278</span> possession of a dangerous weapon or "that the
            defendant was an organizer or leader of criminal activity that involved five or more
            participants" in the indictment and prove them to the jury beyond a reasonable
               doubt.<span class="sup">[5]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Third, even in those trials in which the Guidelines require the finding of facts not
            alleged in the indictment, such factfinding by a judge is not unconstitutional per se.
            To be clear, our holding in Parts I-III, ante, at 243-244 (STEVENS, J., opinion of the
            Court), that Blakely applies to the Guidelines does not establish the "impermissibility
            of judicial factfinding." Brief for United States 46. Instead, judicial factfinding to
            support an offense level determination or an enhancement is only unconstitutional when
            that finding raises the sentence beyond the sentence that could have lawfully been
            imposed by reference to facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant. This
            distinction is crucial to a proper understanding of why the Guidelines could easily
            function as they are currently written.</p>
         <p>Consider, for instance, a case in which the defendant's initial sentencing range under
            the Guidelines is 130-to-162 months, calculated by combining a base offense level of 28
            and a criminal history category of V. See USSG ch. 5, pt. A (Table). Depending upon the
            particular offense, the sentencing judge may use her discretion to select any sentence
            within this range, even if her selection relies upon factual determinations beyond the
            facts found by the jury. If the defendant described above also possessed a firearm, the
            Guidelines would direct the judge to apply a two-level enhancement under § 2D1.1, which
            would raise the defendant's total offense level from 28 to 30. That, in turn, would
            raise the defendant's eligible sentencing range to 151-to-188 months. That act of
            judicial factfinding would comply with the Guidelines and the Sixth Amendment so long as
            the sentencing <span class="star-pagination">*279</span> judge then selected a sentence
            between 151-to-162 months &#x97; the lower number (151) being the bottom of offense
            level 30 and the higher number (162) being the maximum sentence under level 28, which is
            the upper limit of the range supported by the jury findings alone. This type of overlap
            between sentencing ranges is the rule, not the exception, in the Guidelines as currently
            constituted. See 1 Practice Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines § 6.01[B], p. 7 (P.
            Bamberger &amp;amp; D. Gottlieb eds. 4th ed. 2003 Supp.) (noting that nearly all
            Guidelines ranges overlap and that "because of the overlap, the actual sentence imposed
            can theoretically be the same no matter which guideline range is chosen"). Trial courts
            have developed considerable expertise in employing overlapping provisions in such a
            manner as to avoid unnecessary resolution of factual disputes, see § 7.03[B][2], at 34
            (2004 Supp.), and lower courts have shown themselves capable of distinguishing proper
            from improper applications of sentencing enhancements under Blakely, see, e. g., United
            States v. Mayfield, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/ca9/53hu/united-states-v-jerry-wayne-mayfield/">

            </span> (CA9 2004) (upholding a two-level enhancement for firearm possession from
            offense level 34 to 36 because the sentencing judge selected a sentence within the
            overlapping range between the two levels). The interaction of these various Guidelines
            provisions demonstrates the fallacy in the assumption that judicial factfinding can
            never be constitutional under the Guidelines.</p>
         <p>The majority's answer to the fact that the vast majority of applications of the
            Guidelines are constitutional is that "we must determine likely intent not by counting
            proceedings, but by evaluating the consequences of the Court's constitutional
            requirement" on every imaginable case. Ante, at 248 (opinion of BREYER, J.). That
            approach ignores the lessons of our facial invalidity cases. Those cases stress that
            this Court is ill suited to the task of drafting legislation and that, therefore, as a
            matter of respect for coordinate branches of <span class="star-pagination">*280</span>
            Government, we ought to presume whenever possible that those charged with writing and
            implementing legislation will and can apply "the statute consistently with the
            constitutional command." Time, Inc. v. Hill, <span class="citation">

            </span>, 22 (1960). The Government has already shown it can apply the Guidelines
            constitutionally even as written, and Congress is perfectly capable of redrafting the
            statute on its own. Thus, there is no justification for the extreme judicial remedy of
            total invalidation of any part of the SRA or the Guidelines.</p>
         <p>In sum, it is indisputable that the vast majority of federal sentences under the
            Guidelines would have complied with the Sixth Amendment without the Court's
            extraordinary remedy. Under any reasonable reading of our precedents, in no way can it
            be said that the Guidelines are, or that any particular Guidelines provision is,
            facially unconstitutional.</p>

            <i>Severability:</i>

         <p>Even though a statute is not facially invalid, a holding that certain specific
            provisions are unconstitutional may make it necessary to invalidate the entire statute.
            See generally Stern, Separability and Separability Clauses in the Supreme Court, 51
            Harv. L. Rev. 76 (1937) (hereinafter Stern). Our normal rule, however, is that the
            "unconstitutionality of a part of an Act does not necessarily defeat or affect the
            validity of its remaining provisions. Unless it is evident that the legislature would
            not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently of that
            which is not, the invalid part may be dropped if what is left is fully operative <span

         <p>Our "severability" precedents, however, cannot support the Court's remedy because there

            </span>, 684 (1987). Accordingly, severability analysis simply does not apply.</p>
         <p>The majority concludes that our constitutional holding requires the invalidation of §§
            3553(b)(1) and 3742(e). The first <span class="star-pagination">*282</span> of these
            sections uses the word "shall" to make the substantive provisions of the Guidelines
            mandatory. See Mistretta v. United States, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/zm2/mistretta-v-united-states/">
                  <span class="volume">488</span>

            </span>, 367 (1989). The second authorizes de novo review of sentencing judges'
            applications of relevant Guidelines provisions. Neither section is unconstitutional.
            While these provisions can in certain cases, when combined with other statutory and
            Guidelines provisions, result in a violation of the Sixth Amendment, they are plainly
            constitutional on their faces.</p>
         <p>Rather than rely on traditional principles of facial invalidity or severability, the
            majority creates a new category of cases in which this Court may invalidate any part or
            parts of a statute (and add others) when it concludes that Congress would have preferred
            a modified system to administering the statute in compliance with the Constitution. This
            is entirely new law. Usually the Court first declares unconstitutional a particular
            provision of law, and only then does it inquire whether the remainder of the statute can
            be saved. See, e.g., Regan v. Time, 468 U.S., at 652; Alaska Airlines, 480 U. S., at
            684. Review in this manner limits judicial power by minimizing the damage done to the
            statute by judicial fiat. There is no case of which I am aware, however, in which this
            Court has used "severability" analysis to do what the majority does today: determine
            that some unconstitutional applications of a statute, when viewed in light of the
            Court's reading of "likely" legislative intent, justifies the invalidation of certain
            statutory sections in their entirety, their constitutionality notwithstanding, in order
            to save the parts of the statute the Court deemed most important. The novelty of this
            remedial maneuver perhaps explains why no party or amicus curiae to this litigation has
            requested the remedy the Court now orders. In addition, none of the federal courts that
            have addressed Blakely's application to the Guidelines has concluded that striking down
            § 3553(b)(1) is a proper solution.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*283</span> Most importantly, the Court simply has no
            authority to invalidate legislation absent a showing that it is unconstitutional. To
            paraphrase Chief Justice Marshall, an "act of the legislature" must be "repugnant to the
            constitution" in order to be void. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). When a
            provision of a statute is unconstitutional, that provision is void, and the Judiciary is
            therefore not bound by it in a particular case. Here, however, the provisions the
            majority has excised from the statute are perfectly valid: Congress could pass the
            identical statute tomorrow and it would be binding on this Court so long as it were
            administered in compliance with the Sixth Amendment.<span class="sup">[7]</span> Because
            the statute itself is not repugnant to the Constitution and can by its terms comport
            with the Sixth Amendment, the Court does not have the constitutional authority to
            invalidate it.</p>
         <p>The precedent on which the Court relies is scant indeed. It can only point to cases in
            which a provision of law was unconstitutionally extended to or limited to a particular
            class; in such cases it is necessary either to invalidate the provision or to require
            the legislature to extend the benefit to an excluded class.<span class="sup">[8]</span>
            Given the sweeping nature of the <span class="star-pagination">*284</span> remedy
            ordained today, the majority's assertions that it is proper to engage in an ex ante
            analysis of congressional intent in order to select in the first instance the statutory
            provisions to be struck down is contrary to the very purpose of engaging in severability
            analysis&#x97;the Court's remedy expands, rather than limits, judicial power.</p>
         <p>There is no justification for extending our severability cases to cover this situation.
            The SRA and the Guidelines can be read&#x97;and are being currently read&#x97;in a way
            that complies with the Sixth Amendment. If Congress wished to amend the statute to enact
            the majority's vision of how the Guidelines should operate, it would be perfectly free
            to do so. There is no need to devise a novel and questionable method of invalidating
            statutory provisions that can be constitutionally applied.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>Rather than engage in a wholesale rewriting of the SRA, I would simply allow the
            Government to continue doing what it has done since this Court handed down
            Blakely&#x97;prove any fact that is required to increase a defendant's sentence <span
               class="star-pagination">*285</span> under the Guidelines to a jury beyond a
            reasonable doubt. As I have already discussed, a requirement of jury factfinding for
            certain issues can be implemented without difficulty in the vast majority of cases. See
            supra, at 276-280.</p>
         <p>Indeed, this already appears to be the case. "[T]he Department of Justice already has
            instituted procedures which would protect the overwhelming majority of future cases from
            Blakely infirmity. The Department of Justice has issued detailed guidance for every
            stage of the prosecution from indictment to final sentencing, including alleging facts
            that would support sentencing enhancements and requiring defendants to waive any
            potential Blakely rights in plea agreements." Hearings on Blakely 1-2.<span class="sup"
               >[9]</span> Given this experience, I think the Court dramatically overstates the
            difficulty of implementing this solution.</p>
         <p>The majority advances five reasons why the remedy that is already in place will not
            work. First, the majority points to the statutory text referring to "the court" in
            arguing that jury factfinding is impermissible. While this text is no doubt evidence
            that Congress contemplated judicial factfinding, it does not demonstrate that Congress
            thought that judicial factfinding was so essential that, if forced to choose between a
            system including jury determinations of certain facts in certain cases on the one hand,
            and a system in which the Guidelines would cease to restrain the discretion of federal
            judges on the other, Congress would have selected the latter.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*286</span> As a textual matter, the word "court" can
            certainly be read to include a judge's selection of a sentence as supported by a jury
            verdict&#x97;this reading is plausible either as a pure matter of statutory construction
            or under principles of constitutional avoidance. Ordinarily, "`where a statute is
            susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful constitutional
            questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided, our duty is to
            adopt the latter.'" Jones v. United States, <span class="citation">

            </span>, 408 (1909)). This principle, which "has for so long been applied by this Court
            that it is beyond debate," Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building
            &amp;amp; Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988), is intended to show respect
            for Congress by presuming it "legislates in the light of constitutional limitations,"
            Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 191 (1991).</p>
         <p>The Court, however, reverses the ordinary presumption. It interprets the phrase "[t]he
            court ... shall consider" in 18 U.S.C.A. § 3553(a) (Supp. 2004) to mean: The judge shall
            consider and impose the appropriate sentence, but the judge shall not be constrained by
            any findings of a jury. See ante, at 249 (opinion of BREYER, J.) (interpreting the word
            "court" to mean "`the judge without the jury'"). The Court's narrow reading of the
            statutory text is unnecessary. Even assuming that the word "court" should be read to
            mean "judge, and only the judge," a requirement that certain enhancements be supported
            by jury verdicts leaves the ultimate sentencing decision exclusively within the judge's
            hands&#x97;the judge, and the judge alone, would retain the discretion to sentence the
            defendant anywhere within the required Guidelines range and within overlapping
            Guidelines ranges when applicable. See supra, at 278-279. The judge would, no doubt, be
            limited by the findings of the jury in certain cases, but the fact that such a
            limitation would be required by the Sixth Amendment in those limited circumstances is
            not <span class="star-pagination">*287</span> a reason to adopt such a constrained view
            of an Act of Congress.<span class="sup">[10]</span>
         </p>
         <p>In adopting its constrictive reading of "court," the majority has manufactured a broader
            constitutional problem than is necessary, and has thereby made necessary the
            extraordinary remedy it has chosen. I pause, however, to stress that it is not this
            Court's holding that the Guidelines must be applied consistently with the Sixth
            Amendment that has made the majority's remedy necessary. Rather, it is the Court's
            miserly reading of the statutory language that results in "constitutional infirmities."
            See ante, at 254 (opinion of BREYER, J.)</p>
         <p>Second, the Court argues that simply applying Blakely to the Guidelines would make "real
            conduct" sentencing more difficult. While that is perhaps true in some cases, judges
            could always consider relevant conduct obtained from a presentence report pursuant to 18
            U.S.C. § 3661 and USSG § 6A1.1 in selecting a sentence within a Guidelines range, and of
            course would be free to consider any such circumstances in cases in which the defendant
            pleads guilty and waives his Blakely rights. Further, in many cases the Government could
            simply prove additional facts to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt&#x97;as it has been
            doing in some cases since Apprendi&#x97;or the court could use bifurcated proceedings in
            which the relevant conduct is proved to a jury after it has convicted the defendant of
            the underlying crime.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*288</span> The majority is correct, however, that my
            preferred holding would undoubtedly affect "real conduct" sentencing in certain cases.
            This is so because the goal of such sentencing&#x97;increasing a defendant's sentence on
            the basis of conduct not proved at trial&#x97;is contrary to the very core of Apprendi.
            That certain applications of "relevant conduct" sentencing are unconstitutional should
            not come as a complete surprise to Congress: The House Report recognized that "real
            offense" sentencing could pose constitutional difficulties. H. R. Rep. No. 98-1017, p.
            98 (1984). In reality, the majority's concerns about relevant conduct are nothing more
            than an objection to Apprendi itself, an objection that this Court rejected in Parts
            I-III, ante (opinion of STEVENS, J.).</p>
         <p>Further, the Court does not explain how its proposed remedy will ensure that judges take
            real conduct into account. While judges certainly may do so in their discretion under §
            3553(a), there is no indication as to how much or to what extent "relevant conduct"
            should matter under the majority's regime. Nor is there any meaningful standard by which
            appellate courts may review a sentencing judge's "relevant conduct"
            determination&#x97;only a general "reasonableness" inquiry that may discourage
            sentencing judges from considering such conduct altogether. The Court's holding thus may
            do just as much damage to real conduct sentencing as would simply requiring the
            Government to follow the Guidelines consistent with the Sixth Amendment.</p>
         <p>Third, the majority argues that my remedy would make sentencing proceedings far too
            complex. But of the very small number of cases in which a Guidelines sentence would
            implicate the Sixth Amendment, see supra, at 275-276, most involve drug quantity
            determinations, firearm enhancements, and other factual findings that can readily be
            made by juries. I am not blind to the fact that some cases, such as fraud prosecutions,
            would pose new problems for prosecutors and trial judges. See ante, at 252-253 (opinion
            of BREYER, J.). In such cases, I am confident that federal trial <span
               class="star-pagination">*289</span> judges, assisted by capable prosecutors and
            defense attorneys, could have devised appropriate procedures to impose the sentences the
            Guidelines envision in a manner that is consistent with the Sixth Amendment. We have
            always trusted juries to sort through complex facts in various areas of law. This may
            not be the most efficient system imaginable, but the Constitution does not permit
            efficiency to be our primary concern. See Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S., at
            312-313.</p>
         <p>Fourth, the majority assails my reliance on plea bargaining. The Court claims that I
            cannot discount the effect that applying Blakely to the Guidelines would have on
            plea-bargained cases, since the specter of Blakely will affect those cases. However, the
            majority's decision suffers from the same problem to a much greater degree. Prior to the
            Court's decision to strike the mandatory feature of the Guidelines, prosecutors and
            defendants alike could bargain from a position of reasonable confidence with respect to
            the sentencing range into which a defendant would likely fall. The majority, however,
            has eliminated the certainty of expectations in the plea process. And, unlike my
            proposed remedy, which would potentially affect only a fraction of plea bargains, the
            uncertainty resulting from the Court's regime change will infect the entire universe of
            guilty pleas which occur in 97% of all federal prosecutions.</p>
         <p>The majority also argues that applying Blakely to the Guidelines would allow prosecutors
            to exercise "a power the Sentencing Act vested in judges," ante, at 257 (opinion of
            BREYER, J.), by giving prosecutors the choice whether to "charge" a particular fact.
            Under the remedy I favor, however, judges would still be able to reject factually false
            plea agreements under USSG § 6B1.2(a), and could still consider relevant information
            about the offense and the offender in every single case. Judges could consider such
            characteristics as an aid in selecting the appropriate sentence within the Guidelines
            range authorized by the jury verdict, determining the defendant's criminal history
            level, reducing a defendant's <span class="star-pagination">*290</span> sentence, or
            justifying discretionary departures from the applicable Guidelines range. The Court is
            therefore incorrect when it suggests that requiring a supporting jury verdict for
            certain enhancements in certain cases would place certain sentencing factors "beyond the
            reach of the judge entirely." See ante, at 257 (opinion of BREYER, J.).</p>
         <p>Moreover, the premise on which the Court's argument is based&#x97;that the Guidelines as
            currently written prevent fact bargaining and therefore diminish prosecutorial
            power&#x97;is probably not correct. As one commentator has noted,</p> "prosecutors
         exercise nearly as much control when guidelines tie sentences to so-called `real-offense'
         factors.... One might reasonably assume those factors are outside of prosecutors' control,
         but experience with the Federal Sentencing Guidelines suggests otherwise; when necessary,
         the litigants simply bargain about what facts will (and won't) form the basis for
         sentencing. It seems to be an iron rule: guidelines sentencing empowers prosecutors, even
         where the guidelines' authors try to fight that tendency." Stuntz, Plea Bargaining and
         Criminal Law's Disappearing Shadow, 117 Harv. L. Rev. 2548, 2559-2560 (2004) (footnote
         omitted). <p>Not only is fact bargaining quite common under the current system, it is also
            clear that prosecutors have substantial bargaining power.<span class="sup">[11]</span>
            And surely, contrary to the Court's response <span class="star-pagination">*291</span>
            to this dissent, ante, at 256-257 (opinion of BREYER, J.), a prosecutor who need only
            prove an enhancing fact by a preponderance of the evidence has more bargaining power
            than if required to prove the same fact beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
         <p>Finally, the majority argues that my solution would require a different burden of proof
            for enhancements above the maximum authorized by the jury verdict and for reductions.
            This is true because the requirement that guilt be established by proof beyond a
            reasonable doubt is a constitutional mandate. However, given the relatively few
            reductions available in the Guidelines and the availability of judicial discretion
            within the applicable range, this is unlikely to have more than a minimal effect.</p>
         <p>In sum, I find unpersuasive the Court's objections to allowing Congress to decide in the
            first instance whether the Guidelines should be converted from a mandatory into a
            discretionary system. Far more important than those objections is the overwhelming
            evidence that Congress has already considered, and unequivocally rejected, the regime
            that the Court endorses today.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>Even under the Court's innovative approach to severability analysis when confronted with
            unconstitutional applications of a statute, its opinion is unpersuasive. It assumes that
            this Court's only inquiry is to "decide whether we would deviate less radically from
            Congress' intended system (1) by superimposing the constitutional requirement announced
            today or (2) through elimination of some provisions of the statute." Ante, at 247
            (opinion of BREYER, J.). I will assume, consistently with the majority, that in this
            exercise we should never use our "remedial powers to circumvent the intent of the
            legislature," Califano v. Westcott, 443 U. S. 76, 94 (1979) (Powell, J., concurring in
            part and dissenting in part), and that we must not create "a program quite different
               <span class="star-pagination">*292</span> from the one the legislature actually
            adopted," Sloan v. Lemon, 413 U. S. 825, 834 (1973).</p>
         <p>In the context of this framework, in order to justify "excising" 18 U. S. C. A. §§
            3553(b)(1) (Supp. 2004) and 3742(e) (main ed. and Supp. 2004), the Court has the burden
            of showing that Congress would have preferred the remaining system of discretionary
            Sentencing Guidelines to not just the remedy I would favor, but also to any available
            alternative, including the alternative of total invalidation, which would give Congress
            a clean slate on which to write an entirely new law. The Court cannot meet this burden
            because Congress has already considered and overwhelmingly rejected the system it enacts
            today. In doing so, Congress revealed both an unmistakable preference for the certainty
            of a binding regime and a deep suspicion of judges' ability to reduce disparities in
            federal sentencing. A brief examination of the SRA's history reveals the gross
            impropriety of the remedy the Court has selected.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>
            <i>History of Sentence Reform Efforts:</i>
         </h2>
         <p>In the mid-1970's, Congress began to study the numerous problems attendant to
            indeterminate sentencing in the federal criminal justice system. After nearly a decade
            of review, Congress in 1984 decided that the system needed a comprehensive overhaul. The
            elimination of sentencing disparity, which Congress determined was chiefly the result of
            a discretionary sentencing regime, was unquestionably Congress' principal aim. See
            Feinberg, Federal Criminal Sentencing Reform: Congress and the United States Sentencing
            Commission, 28 Wake Forest L. Rev. 291, 295-296 (1993) ("The first and foremost goal of
            the sentencing reform effort was to alleviate the perceived problem of federal criminal
            sentencing disparity.... Quite frankly, all other considerations were secondary"); see
            also Breyer, Federal Sentencing Guidelines Revisited, 2 Fed. Sentencing Rptr. 180 (1999)
            ("In seeking `greater fairness,' Congress, acting in bipartisan <span
               class="star-pagination">*293</span> fashion, intended to respond to complaints of
            unreasonable disparity in sentencing&#x97;that is, complaints that differences among
            sentences reflected not simply different offense conduct or different offender history,
            but the fact that different judges imposed the sentences" (emphases added)). As Senator
            Hatch, a central participant in the reform effort, has explained: "The discretion that
            Congress had conferred for so long upon the judiciary and the parole authorities was at
            the heart of sentencing disparity." The Role of Congress in Sentencing: The United
            States Sentencing Commission, Mandatory Minimum Sentences, and the Search for a Certain
            and Effective Sentencing System, 28 Wake Forest L. Rev. 185, 187 (1993) (hereinafter
            Hatch) (emphasis added).</p>
         <p>Consequently, Congress explicitly rejected as a model for reform the various proposals
            for advisory guidelines that had been introduced in past Congresses. One example of such
            legislation was the bill introduced in 1977 by Senators Kennedy and McClellan, S. 1437,
            95th Cong., 1st Sess. (as reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Nov. 15, 1977)
            (hereinafter S. 1437), which allowed judges to impose sentences based on the
            characteristics of the individual defendant and granted judges substantial discretion to
            depart from recommended guidelines sentences. See Stith &amp;amp; Koh, The Politics of
            Sentencing Reform: The Legislative History of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, 28 Wake
            Forest L. Rev. 223, 238 (1993) (hereinafter Stith &amp;amp; Koh). That bill never became
            law and was refined several times between 1977 and 1984: Each of those refinements made
            the regime more, not less, restrictive on trial judges' discretion in sentencing.<span

            <span class="star-pagination">*294</span>
            <i>Passage of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984:</i>
         </h2>
         <p>Congress' preference for binding guidelines was evident in the debate over passage of
            the SRA itself, which was predicated entirely on the move from a discretionary
            guidelines system to the mandatory system the Court strikes down today. The SRA was the
            product of competing versions of sentencing reform legislation: the House bill, H. R.
            6012, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., authorized the creation of discretionary guidelines whereas
            the Senate bill, S. 668, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., provided for binding guidelines and de
            novo appellate review. The House was splintered regarding whether to make the Guidelines
            binding on judges, but the vote in the Senate was an overwhelming 85 to 3 in favor of
            binding Guidelines. 130 Cong. Rec. 1649 (1984); see generally Stith &amp;amp; Koh
            261-266. Eventually, the House substituted the Senate version for H. R. 6012, and the
            current system of mandatory Guidelines became law. 130 Cong. Rec. 29730 (1984).</p>
         <p>The text of the law that actually passed Congress (including §§ 3553(b)(1) and 3742(e))
            should be more than sufficient to demonstrate Congress' unmistakable commitment to a
            binding Guidelines system. That text requires the sentencing judge to impose the
            sentence dictated by the Guidelines ("[T]he court shall impose a sentence of the kind,
            and within the range" provided in the Guidelines unless there is a circumstance "not
            adequately taken into consideration by the" <span class="star-pagination">*295</span>
            Guidelines), and § 3742(e) gives § 3553(b)(1) teeth by instructing judges that any
            sentence outside of the Guidelines range without adequate explanation will be overturned
            on appeal.<span class="sup">[13]</span> Congress' chosen regime was carefully designed
            to produce uniform compliance with the Guidelines. Congress surely would not have taken
            the pains to create such a regime had it found the Court's system of discretionary
            guidelines acceptable in any way.</p>
         <p>The accompanying Senate Report and floor debate make plain what should be obvious from
            the structure of the statute: Congress refused to accept the discretionary system that
            the Court implausibly deems most consistent with congressional intent.<span class="sup"
               >[14]</span> In other words, given the choice between the statute created by the
            Court today or a clean slate <span class="star-pagination">*296</span> on which to write
            a wholly different law, Congress undoubtedly would have selected the latter.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>
            <i>Congress' Method of Reducing Disparities:</i>
         </h2>
         <p>The notion that Congress had any confidence that judges would reduce sentencing
            disparities by considering relevant conduct &#x97; an idea that is championed by the
            Court, ante, at 253-254 (opinion of BREYER, J.) &#x97; either ignores or misreads the
            political environment in which the SRA passed. It is true that the SRA instructs
            sentencing judges to consider real offense and offender characteristics, 28 U.S.C.A. §
            994 (main ed. and Supp. 2004), but Congress only wanted judges to consider those
            characteristics within the limits of a mandatory system.<span class="sup">[15]</span>
            The Senate Report on which the Court relies, see ante, at 249-250, clearly concluded
            that the existence of sentencing disparities "can be traced directly to the unfettered
            discretion the law confers on those judges . . . responsible for imposing and
            implementing the sentence." S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 38 (1983). Even in a system in which
            judges could not impose sentences based on "relevant conduct" <span
               class="star-pagination">*297</span> determinations (absent a plea agreement or
            supporting jury findings), sentences would still be every bit as certain and uniform as
            in the status quo &#x97; at most, the process for imposing those sentences would be more
            complex. The same can hardly be said of the Court's chosen system, in which all federal
            sentencing judges, in all cases, regain the unconstrained discretion Congress eliminated
            in 1984.</p>
         <p>The Court's conclusion that Congress envisioned a sentencing judge as the centerpiece of
            its effort to reduce disparities is remarkable given the context of the broader
            legislative debate about what entity would be responsible for drafting the Guidelines
            under the SRA. The House version of the bill preferred the Guidelines to be written by
            the Judicial Conference of the United States &#x97; the House Report accompanying that
            bill argued that judges had vast experience in sentencing and would best be able to
            craft a system capable of providing sentences based on real conduct without excessive
            disparity. See H. R. Rep. No. 98-1017, at 93-94. Those in the Senate majority, however,
            favored an independent Commission. They did so, whether rightly or wrongly, based on a
            belief that federal judges could not be trusted to impose fair and uniform sentences.
            See, e. g., 130 Cong. Rec. 976 (1984) (remarks of Sen. Laxalt) ("The present problem
            with disparity in sentencing . . . stems precisely from the failure of [f]ederal judges
            &#x97; individually and collectively &#x97; to sentence similarly situated defendants in
            a consistent, reasonable manner. There is little reason to believe that judges will now
            begin to do what they have failed to do in the past"). And, at the end of the debate,
            the few remaining Members in the minority recognized that the battle to empower judges
            with more discretion had been lost. See, e. g., id., at 973 (remarks of Sen. Mathias)
            (arguing that "[t]he proponents of the bill ... argue in essence that judges cannot be
            trusted. You cannot trust a judge ... you must not trust a judge"). I find it impossible
            to believe that a Congress in which these <span class="star-pagination">*298</span>
            sentiments prevailed would have ever approved of the discretionary sentencing regime the
            Court enacts today.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>
            <i>Congressional Activity Since 1984:</i>
         </h2>
         <p>Congress has not wavered in its commitment to a binding system of Sentencing Guidelines.
            In fact, Congress has rejected each and every attempt to loosen the rigidity of the
            Guidelines or vest judges with more sentencing options. See Hatch 189 ("In ensuing
            years, Congress would maintain its adherence to the concept of binding guidelines by
            consistently rejecting efforts to make the guidelines more discretionary"). Most
            recently, Congress' passage of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the
            Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (PROTECT Act), Pub. L. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650,
            reinforced the mandatory nature of the Guidelines by expanding de novo review of
            sentences to include all departures from the Guidelines and by directing the Commission
            to limit the number of available departures. The majority admits that its holding has
            made the PROTECT Act irrelevant. See ante, at 261 (opinion of BREYER, J.) (admitting
            that after the Court's remedy, the PROTECT Act's provisions "have ceased to be
            relevant"). Even a cursory reading of the legislative history of the PROTECT Act reveals
            the absurdity of the claim that Congress would find acceptable, under any circumstances,
            the Court's restoration of judicial discretion through the facial invalidation of §§
            3553(b)(1) and 3742(e).<span class="sup">[16]</span> In sum, despite Congress'
            unequivocal <span class="star-pagination">*299</span> demand that the Guidelines operate
            as a binding system, and in the name of avoiding any reduction in the power of the
            sentencing judge vis-à-vis the jury (a subject to which Congress did not speak), the
            majority has erased the heart of the SRA and ignored in their entirety all of the
            Legislative Branch's postenactment expressions of how the Guidelines are supposed to
            operate.</p>
         <p>The majority's answer to this overwhelming history is that retaining a mandatory
            Guidelines system "is not a choice that remains open" given our holding that Blakely
            applies to the Guidelines. Ante, at 265. This argument&#x97;essentially, that the
            Apprendi rule makes determinate sentencing unconstitutional &#x97; has been advanced
            repeatedly since Apprendi. See, e. g., 530 U. S., at 549-554 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting);
            Blakely, 542 U. S., at 314 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting); id., at 345-346 (BREYER, J.,
            dissenting). These prophecies were self fulfilling. It is not Apprendi that has brought
            an end to determinate sentencing. This Court clearly had the power to adopt a remedy
            that both complied with the Sixth Amendment and also preserved a determinate sentencing
            regime in which judges make regular factual determinations regarding a defendant's
            sentence. It has chosen instead to exaggerate the constitutional problem and to expand
            the scope of judicial invalidation far beyond that which is even arguably necessary. Our
            holding that Blakely applies to the Sentencing Guidelines did not dictate the Court's
            unprecedented remedy.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>
            <span class="star-pagination">*300</span> IV</h2>
         <p>As a matter of policy, the differences between the regime enacted by Congress and the
            system the Court has chosen are stark. Were there any doubts about whether Congress
            would have preferred the majority's solution, these are sufficient to dispel them.
            First, Congress' stated goal of uniformity is eliminated by the majority's remedy. True,
            judges must still consider the sentencing range contained in the Guidelines, but that
            range is now nothing more than a suggestion that may or may not be persuasive to a judge
            when weighed against the numerous other considerations listed in 18 U. S. C. A. §
            3553(a) (main ed. and Supp. 2004). The result is certain to be a return to the same type
            of sentencing disparities Congress sought to eliminate in 1984. Prior to the PROTECT
            Act, rates of departure from the applicable Guidelines sentence (via upward or downward
            departure) varied considerably depending upon the Circuit in which one was sentenced.
            See Sourcebook 53-55 (Table 26) (showing that 76.6% of sentences in the Fourth Circuit
            were within the applicable Guidelines range, whereas only 48.8% of sentences in the
            Ninth Circuit fell within the range). Those disparities will undoubtedly increase in a
            discretionary system in which the Guidelines are but one factor a judge must consider in
            sentencing a defendant within a broad statutory range.</p>
         <p>Moreover, the Court has neglected to provide a critical procedural protection that
            existed prior to the enactment of a binding Guidelines system. Before the SRA, the
            sentencing judge had the discretion to impose a sentence that designated a minimum term
            "at the expiration of which the prisoner shall become eligible for parole." 18 U. S. C.
            § 4205(b) (1982 ed.) (repealed by Pub. L. 98-473, § 218(a)(5), 98 Stat. 2027).
            Sentencing judges had the discretion to reduce a minimum term of imprisonment upon the
            recommendation of the Bureau of Prisons. § 4205(g). Through these provisions <span
               class="star-pagination">*301</span> and others, see generally §§ 4201-4215, all of
            which were effectively repealed in 1984, it was the Parole Commission &#x97; not the
            sentencing judge &#x97; who was ultimately responsible for determining the length of
            each defendant's real sentence. See, e. g., S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 38. Prior to the
            Guidelines regime, the Parole Commission was designed to reduce sentencing disparities
            and to provide a check for defendants who had received excessive sentences. Today, the
            Court reenacts the discretionary Guidelines system that once existed without providing
            this crucial safety net.</p>
         <p>Other concerns are likely to arise. Congress' demand in the PROTECT Act that departures
            from the Guidelines be closely regulated and monitored is eviscerated &#x97; for there
            can be no "departure" from a mere suggestion. How will a judge go about determining how
            much deference to give to the applicable Guidelines range? How will a court of appeals
            review for reasonableness a district court's decision that the need for "just
            punishment" and "adequate deterrence to criminal conduct" simply outweighs the
            considerations contemplated by the Sentencing Commission? See 18 U.S.C. §§
            3553(a)(2)(A)-(B). What if a sentencing judge determines that a defendant's need for
            "educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in
            the most effective manner," § 3553(a)(2)(D), requires disregarding the stiff Guidelines
            range Congress presumably preferred? These questions will arise in every case in the
            federal system under the Court's system. Regrettably, these are exactly the sort of
            questions Congress hoped that sentencing judges would not ask after the SRA.</p>
         <p>The consequences of such a drastic change &#x97; unaided by the usual processes of
            legislative deliberation &#x97; are likely to be sweeping. For example, the majority's
            unnecessarily broad remedy sends every federal sentence back to the drawing board, or at
            least into the novel review for "reasonableness," regardless of whether those
            individuals' constitutional <span class="star-pagination">*302</span> rights were
            violated. It is highly unlikely that the mere application of "prudential doctrines" will
            mitigate the consequences of such a gratuitous change.</p>
         <p>The majority's remedy was not the inevitable result of the Court's holding that Blakely
            applies to the Guidelines. Neither Apprendi, nor Blakely, nor these cases made
            determinate sentencing unconstitutional.<span class="sup">[17]</span> Merely requiring
            all applications of the Guidelines to comply with the Sixth Amendment would have allowed
            judges to distinguish harmless error from error requiring correction, would have
            required no more complicated procedures than the procedural regime the majority enacts
            today, and, ultimately, would have left most sentences intact.</p>
         <p>Unlike a rule that would merely require judges and prosecutors to comply with the Sixth
            Amendment, the Court's systematic overhaul turns the entire system on its head in every
            case, and, in so doing, runs contrary to the central purpose that motivated Congress to
            act in the first instance. Moreover, by repealing the right to a determinate sentence
            that Congress established in the SRA, the Court has effectively eliminated the very
            constitutional right Apprendi sought to vindicate. No judicial remedy is proper if it is
            "not commensurate with the constitutional violation to be repaired." Hills v. Gautreaux,
            425 U. S. 284, 294 (1976). The Court's system fails that test, frustrates Congress'
            principal goal in <span class="star-pagination">*303</span> enacting the SRA, and
            violates the tradition of judicial restraint that has heretofore limited our power to
            overturn validly enacted statutes.</p>

         <p>JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting in part.</p>
         <p>I join the portions of the opinion of the Court that are delivered by JUSTICE STEVENS. I
            also join JUSTICE STEVENS's dissent, with the exception of Part III<span class="sup"
               >[1]</span> and footnote 17. I write separately mainly to add some comments regarding
            the change that the remedial majority's handiwork has wrought (or perhaps &#x97; who can
            tell? &#x97; has not wrought) upon appellate review of federal sentencing.</p>
         <p>The remedial majority takes as the North Star of its analysis the fact that Congress
            enacted a "judge-based sentencing system." Ante, at 265 (opinion of BREYER, J.). That
            seems to me quite misguided. Congress did indeed expect judges to make the factual
            determinations to which the Guidelines apply, just as it expected the Guidelines to be
            mandatory. But which of those expectations was central to the congressional purpose is
            not hard to determine. No headline describing the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Act)
            would have read "Congress reaffirms judge-based sentencing" rather than "Congress
            prescribes standardized sentences." JUSTICE BREYER's opinion for the Court repeatedly
            acknowledges that the primary objective of the Act was to reduce <span
               class="star-pagination">*304</span> sentencing disparity.<span class="sup">[2]</span>
            Inexplicably, however, the opinion concludes that the manner of achieving uniform
            sentences was more important to Congress than actually achieving uniformity &#x97; that
            Congress was so attached to having judges determine "real conduct" on the basis of
            bureaucratically prepared, hearsay-riddled presentence reports that it would rather lose
            the binding nature of the Guidelines than adhere to the old-fashioned process of having
            juries find the facts that expose a defendant to increased prison time. See ante, at
            253-254, 265. The majority's remedial choice is thus wonderfully ironic: In order to
            rescue from nullification a statutory scheme designed to eliminate discretionary
            sentencing, it discards the provisions that eliminate discretionary sentencing.</p>
         <p>That is the plain effect of the remedial majority's decision to excise 18 U. S. C. A. §
            3553(b)(1) (Supp. 2004). See ante, at 259. District judges will no longer be told they
            "shall impose a sentence ... within the range" established by the Guidelines. §
            3553(b)(1). Instead, under § 3553(a), they will need only to "consider" that range as
            one of many factors, including "the need for the sentence ... to provide just punishment
            for the offense," § 3553(a)(2)(A) (main ed.), "to afford adequate deterrence to criminal
            conduct," § 3553(a)(2)(B), and "to protect the public from the further crimes of the
            defendant," § 3553(a)(2)(C). The statute provides no order <span class="star-pagination"
               >*305</span> of priority among all those factors, but since the three just mentioned
            are the fundamental criteria governing penology, the statute &#x97; absent the mandate
            of § 3553(b)(1) &#x97; authorizes the judge to apply his own perceptions of just
            punishment, deterrence, and protection of the public even when these differ from the
            perceptions of the Commission members who drew up the Guidelines. Since the Guidelines
            are not binding, in order to comply with the (oddly) surviving requirement that the
            court set forth "the specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from
            that described" in the Guidelines, § 3553(c)(2), the sentencing judge need only state
            that "this court does not believe that the punishment set forth in the Guidelines is
            appropriate for this sort of offense."<span class="sup">[3]</span> That is to say,
            district courts have discretion to sentence anywhere within the ranges authorized by
            statute &#x97; much as they were generally able to do before the Guidelines came into
            being. To be sure, factor (6) is "the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities
            among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct," §
            3553(a)(2)(6) (main ed.), but this would require a judge to adhere to the Guidelines
            only if all other judges had to adhere to the Guidelines (which they certainly do not,
            as the Court holds today) or if all other judges could at least be expected to adhere to
            the Guidelines (which they certainly cannot, given the notorious unpopularity of the
            Guidelines with many district judges). Thus, logic compels the conclusion that the
            sentencing judge, after considering the recited factors (including the Guidelines), has
            full discretion, as full as what he possessed before the Act was passed, to sentence
            anywhere within the statutory range. If the <span class="star-pagination">*306</span>
            majority thought otherwise &#x97; if it thought the Guidelines not only had to be
            "considered" (as the amputated statute requires) but had generally to be followed &#x97;
            its opinion would surely say so.<span class="sup">[4]</span>
         </p>
         <p>As frustrating as this conclusion is to the Act's purpose of uniform sentencing, it at
            least establishes a clear and comprehensible regime &#x97; essentially the regime that
            existed before the Act became effective. That clarity is eliminated, however, by the
            remedial majority's surgery on 18 U. S. C. A. §3742 (main ed. and Supp. 2004), the
            provision governing appellate review of sentences. Even the most casual reading of this
            section discloses that its purpose &#x97; its only purpose &#x97; is to enable courts of
            appeals to enforce conformity with the Guidelines. All of the provisions of that section
            that impose a review obligation beyond what existed under prior law<span class="sup"
               >[5]</span> are related to the district judge's obligations under the Guidelines. If
            the Guidelines are no longer binding, one would think that the provision designed to
            ensure compliance with them would, in its totality, be inoperative. The Court holds
            otherwise. Like a black-robed Alexander cutting the Gordian knot, it simply severs the
            purpose of the review provisions from their text, holding that only subsection (e),
            which sets forth the determinations that the court of appeals must make, is inoperative,
            whereas all the rest of § 3742 subsists &#x97; including, mirabile dictu, subsection
            (f), <span class="star-pagination">*307</span> entitled "Decision and disposition,"
            which tracks the determinations required by the severed subsection (e) and specifies
            what disposition each of those determinations is to produce. This is rather like
            deleting the ingredients portion of a recipe and telling the cook to proceed with the
            preparation portion.<span class="sup">[6]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Until today, appellate review of sentencing discretion has been limited to instances
            prescribed by statute. Before the Guidelines, federal appellate courts had little
            experience reviewing sentences for anything but legal error. "[W]ell-established
            doctrine," this Court said, "bars [appellate] review of the exercise of sentencing
            discretion." Dorszynski v. United States, 418 U. S. 424, 443 (1974). "[O]nce it is
            determined that a sentence is within the limitations set forth in the statute under
            which it is imposed, appellate review is at an end." Id., at 431-432 (citing cases).
            When it established the Guidelines regime, Congress expressly provided for appellate
            review of sentences in specified circumstances, but the Court has been appropriately
            chary of aggrandizement, refusing to treat § 3742 as a blank check to appellate courts.
            Thus, in 1992, the Court recognized that Congress's grant of "limited appellate review
            of sentencing decisions ... did not alter a court of appeals' traditional deference to a
            district court's exercise of its sentencing discretion." Williams v. United States, 503
            U. S. 193, 205 (emphasis added). <span class="star-pagination">*308</span>
            Notwithstanding § 3742, much remained off limits to the courts of appeals: "The
            selection of the appropriate sentence from within the guideline range, as well as the
            decision to depart from the range in certain circumstances, are decisions that are left
            solely to the sentencing court." Ibid. (emphasis added). Similarly, in 1996, the Court
            took pains to note that the § 3742 power to engage in "limited appellate review" of
            Guidelines departures did not "vest in appellate courts wide-ranging authority over
            district court sentencing decisions." Koon v. United States, 518 U. S. 81, 97. The Court
            repeated its caution that "`[t]he development of the guideline sentencing regime'" did
            not allow appellate review "`except to the extent specifically directed by statute.'"
            Ibid. (quoting Williams, supra, at 205).</p>
         <p>Today's remedial opinion does not even pretend to honor this principle that sentencing
            discretion is unreviewable except pursuant to specific statutory direction. The
            discussion of appellate review begins with the declaration that, "despite the absence of
            § 3553(b)(1) (Supp. 2004), the Act continues to provide for appeals from sentencing
            decisions (irrespective of whether the trial judge sentences within or outside the
            Guidelines range ...)," ante, at 260 (citing §§ 3742(a) and (b)); and the opinion later
            announces that the standard of review for all such appeals is "unreasonableness," ante,
            at 261, 264-265. This conflates different and distinct statutory authorizations of
            appeal and elides crucial differences in the statutory scope of review. Section 3742
            specifies four different kinds of appeal,<span class="sup">[7]</span> setting forth for
            each the grounds of <span class="star-pagination">*309</span> appeal permitted to the
            defendant and the Government (§§ 3742(a) and (b)), the manner in which each ground
            should be considered (§ 3742(e)), and the permissible dispositions (§ 3742(f)). There is
            no one-size-fits-all "unreasonableness" review. The power to review a sentence for
            reasonableness arises only when the sentencing court has departed from "the applicable
            guideline range." § 3742(f)(2); cf. United States v. Soltero-Lopez, 11 F. 3d 18, 19 (CA1
            1993) (Breyer, C. J.) ("[T]he sentencing statutes ... provide [a defendant] with only a
            very narrow right of appeal" because the power "to set aside a departure that is
            `unreasonable'" appears "in the context of other provisions that permit defendants to
            appeal only upward . . . departures"). This Court has expressly rejected the proposition
            that there may be a "reasonable[ness]" inquiry when a sentence is imposed as a result of
            an incorrect application of the Guidelines. See Williams, supra, at 201.</p>
         <p>The Court claims that "a statute that does not explicitly set forth a standard of review
            may nonetheless do so implicitly." Ante, at 260 (opinion of BREYER, J.). Perhaps so. But
            we have before us a statute that does explicitly set forth a standard of review. The
            question is, when the Court has severed that standard of review (contained in §
            3742(e)), does it make any sense to look for some congressional "implication" of a
            different standard of review in the remnants of the statute that the Court has left
            standing? Only in Wonderland. (This may explain in part why, as JUSTICE STEVENS's
            dissent correctly observes, ante, at 282, none of the numerous persons and organizations
            filing briefs as parties or amici in these cases &#x97; all of whom filed this side of
            the looking-glass &#x97; proposed, or I think even imagined, the remedial majority's
            wonderful disposition.) Unsurprisingly, none of the three cases cited by the Court used
            the power of implication <span class="star-pagination">*310</span> to fill a gap created
            by the Court's own removal of an explicit standard.<span class="sup">[8]</span> The
            Court's need to create a new, "implied" standard of review&#x97;however "linguistically"
            "fair," ante, at 262&#x97;amounts to a confession that it has exceeded its powers.
            According to the "well established" standard for severability, the unconstitutional part
            of a statute "may be dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law." Alaska

         <p>Even assuming that the Court ought to be inferring standards of review to stanch the
            bleeding created by its aggressive severance of § 3742(e), its "unreasonableness"
            standard is not, as it claims, consistent with the "related statutory language" or with
            "appellate sentencing practice during the last two decades." Ante, at 260, 262. As
            already noted, sentences within the Guidelines range have not previously been reviewed
            for reasonableness. Indeed, the very concept of having a unitary standard of review for
            all kinds of appeals authorized by §§ 3742(a) and (b) finds no support in statutory
            language or established practice of the last two decades. Although a "reasonableness"
            standard did appear in § 3742(e)(3) until 2003, it never extended beyond review of
            deliberate departures from the Guidelines range. See 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e)(3) (2000 ed.);
            see also §§ 3742(f)(2)(A), (B) (prescribing how to dispose on appeal of a sentence that
               <span class="star-pagination">*311</span> is "outside the applicable guideline range
            and is unreasonable"). According to the statistics cited by the Court, that standard
            applied to only 16.7% of federal sentencing appeals in 2002, see ante, at 262 (opinion
            of BREYER, J.), but the Court would now have it apply across the board to all sentencing
            appeals, even to sentences within "the applicable guideline range," where there is no
            legal error or misapplication of the Guidelines.</p>
         <p>There can be no doubt that the Court's severability analysis has produced a scheme
            dramatically different from anything Congress has enacted since 1984. Sentencing courts
            are told to "provide just punishment" (among other things), and appellate courts are
            told to ensure that district judges are not "unreasonable." The worst feature of the
            scheme is that no one knows&#x97;and perhaps no one is meant to know&#x97;how advisory
            Guidelines and "unreasonableness" review will function in practice. The Court's
            description of what it anticipates is positively Delphic: "These features of the
            remaining system . . . continue to move sentencing in Congress' preferred direction,
            helping to avoid excessive sentencing disparities while maintaining flexibility
            sufficient to individualize sentences where necessary. We can find no feature of the
            remaining system that tends to hinder, rather than to further, these basic objectives."
            Ante, at 264-265 (citation omitted).</p>
         <p>As I have suggested earlier, any system which held it per se unreasonable (and hence
            reversible) for a sentencing judge to reject the Guidelines is indistinguishable from
            the mandatory Guidelines system that the Court today holds unconstitutional. But the
            remedial majority's gross exaggerations (it says that the "practical standard of review"
            it prescribes is "already familiar to appellate courts" and "consistent with appellate
            sentencing practice during the last two decades," ante, at 261, 262)<span class="sup"
               >[9]</span> may lead some courts of appeals to conclude&#x97;may <span
               class="star-pagination">*312</span> indeed be designed to lead courts of appeals to
            conclude&#x97;that little has changed. Bear in mind that one of the most significant
            features of the remedial majority's scheme of "unreasonableness" review is that it
            requires courts of appeals to evaluate each sentence individually for reasonableness,
            rather than apply the cookie-cutter standards of the mandatory Guidelines (within the
            correct Guidelines range, affirm; outside the range without adequate explanation, vacate
            and remand). A court of appeals faced with this daunting prospect might seek refuge in
            the familiar and continue (as the remedial majority invites, though the merits majority
            forbids) the "appellate sentencing practice during the last two decades," ante, at 262
            (opinion of BREYER, J.). At the other extreme, a court of appeals might handle the new
            workload by approving virtually any sentence within the statutory range that the
            sentencing court imposes, so long as the district judge goes through the appropriate
            formalities, such as expressing his consideration of and disagreement with the
            Guidelines sentence. What I anticipate will happen is that "unreasonableness" review
            will produce a discordant symphony of different standards, varying from court to court
            and judge to judge, giving the lie to the remedial majority's sanguine claim that "no
            feature" of its avant-garde Guidelines system will "ten[d] to hinder" the avoidance of
            "excessive sentencing disparities." Ante, at 265.</p>

            is about to wreak on trial courts across the country." Id., at 324 (opinion of O'CONNOR,

               <span class="star-pagination">*313</span> uncertainty, until the Court could get
            before it a case properly presenting the constitutionality of the mandatory Guidelines.
            Today, the same Justices wreak havoc on federal district and appellate courts quite
            needlessly, and for the indefinite future. Will appellate review for "unreasonableness"
            preserve de facto mandatory Guidelines by discouraging district courts from sentencing
            outside Guidelines ranges? Will it simply add another layer of unfettered judicial
            discretion to the sentencing process? Or will it be a mere formality, used by busy
            appellate judges only to ensure that busy district judges say all the right things when
            they explain how they have exercised their newly restored discretion? Time may tell, but

            Guidelines resulted in impermissible factfinding in Booker's case, but not in Fanfan's.
            Thus Booker's sentence is unconstitutional, but Fanfan's is not. Rather than applying
            the usual presumption in favor of severability, and leaving the Guidelines standing
            insofar as they may be applied without any constitutional problem, the remedial majority
            converts the Guidelines from a mandatory system to a discretionary one. The majority's

         <p>Booker's case presents an as-applied challenge. Booker challenges Guidelines
            enhancements that, based on factfinding by a judge alone, raised his sentence above the
            range legally mandated for his base offense level, determined by reference to the jury
            verdict. In effect, he contends that the Guidelines supporting the enhancements, and the
            Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA) that makes the Guidelines enhancements mandatory,
            were unconstitutionally applied to him. (Fanfan makes no similar contention, as he seeks
            to uphold the District Court's application of the Guidelines.)</p>
         <p>A provision of the SRA, 18 U.S.C.A. § 3553(b)(1) (Supp. 2004), commands that the court
            "shall impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range, referred to in subsection
            (a)(4)," which in turn refers to the Guidelines. (Emphasis added.) The Court reasons
            that invalidating § 3553(b)(1) would render the Guidelines nonbinding and therefore
            constitutional. <span class="star-pagination">*315</span> Hence, it concludes, §

            narrow in that it focuses only on § 3553(b)(1), when Booker's unconstitutional sentence
            enhancements stemmed not from § 3553(b)(1) alone, but from the combination of §
            3553(b)(1) and individual Guidelines. Specifically, in Booker's case, the District Court
            increased the base offense level<span class="sup">[2]</span> under these Guidelines<span
               class="sup">[3]</span>: USSG § 1B1.3(a)(2), which instructs that the base offense
            level shall (for certain offenses) take into account all acts "that were part of the
            same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction"; §
            2D1.1(c)(2), which sets the offense level for 500g to 1.5kg of cocaine base at 36; and §
            3C1.1, which provides for a two-level increase in the offense level for obstruction of
            justice. The court also implicitly applied § 1B1.1, which provides general instructions
            for applying the Guidelines, including determining the base offense level and applying
            appropriate adjustments; § 1B1.11(b)(2), <span class="star-pagination">*316</span> which
            requires that "[t]he Guidelines Manual in effect on a particular date shall be applied
            in its entirety"; § 6A1.3(b) p. s.,<span class="sup">[4]</span> which provides that
            "[t]he court shall resolve disputed sentencing factors at a sentencing hearing in
            accordance with Rule 32(c)(1), Fed. R. Crim. P."; and Rule 32(c)(1),<span class="sup"
               >[5]</span> which in turn provided:</p> "At the sentencing hearing, the court ...
         must rule on any unresolved objections to the presentence report.... For each matter
         controverted, the court must make either a finding on the allegation or a determination
         that no finding is necessary because the controverted matter will not be taken into account
         in, or will not affect, sentencing." <p>Section 3553(b)(1), the listed Guidelines and
            policy statement, and Rule 32(c)(1) are unconstitutional as applied to Booker. Under
            their authority, the judge, rather than the jury, found the facts necessary to increase
            Booker's offense level pursuant to the listed provisions; the judge found those facts by
            a preponderance of the evidence, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt; and, on the
            basis of these findings, the judge imposed a sentence above the maximum legally
            permitted by the jury's findings. Thus, in Booker's case, the concerted action of §
            3553(b)(1) and the operative Guidelines and the relevant Rule of Criminal Procedure
            resulted in unconstitutional <span class="star-pagination">*317</span> judicial
            factfinding. The majority cannot pinpoint § 3553(b)(1) alone as the source of the
            violation.</p>
         <p>At the same time, the majority's remedy is far too broad. We have before us only a
            single unconstitutional application of § 3553(b)(1) (and accompanying parts of the
            sentencing scheme). In such a case, facial invalidation is unprecedented. It is
            particularly inappropriate here, where it is evident that § 3553(b)(1) is entirely
            constitutional in numerous other applications. Fanfan's case is an example: The judge
            applied the Guidelines to the extent supported by the jury's findings. This application
            of § 3553(b)(1) was constitutional. To take another example, when the Government seeks a
            sentence within the Guidelines range supported by the jury's verdict, applying §
            3553(b)(1) to restrict the judge's discretion to that Guidelines range is
            constitutional.</p>
         <p>Section 3553(b)(1) is also constitutional when the Government seeks a sentence above the
            Guidelines range supported by the jury's verdict, but proves the facts supporting the
            enhancements to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Section 3553(b)(1) provides that "the
            court shall impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range," set by the Guidelines.
            (Emphasis added.) It says nothing, however, about the procedures the court must employ
            to determine the sentence it ultimately "impose[s]." It says nothing about whether,
            before imposing a sentence, the court may submit sentence-enhancing facts to the jury;
            and it says nothing about the standard of proof. Because it does not address at all the
            procedures for Guidelines sentencing proceedings, § 3553(b)(1) comfortably accommodates
            cases in which a court determines a defendant's Guidelines range by way of jury
            factfinding or admissions rather than judicial factfinding.</p>
         <p>The Constitution does not prohibit what § 3553(b)(1) accomplishes&#x97;binding district
            courts to the Guidelines. It prohibits allowing a judge alone to make a finding that
            raises the sentence beyond the sentence that could have lawfully <span
               class="star-pagination">*318</span> been imposed by reference to facts found by the
            jury or admitted by the defendant. Many applications of § 3553(b)(1) suffer from no such
            vice. Yet the majority, by facially invalidating the statute, also invalidates these
            unobjectionable applications of the statute and thereby ignores the longstanding
            distinction between as-applied and facial challenges.</p>
         <p>Just as there is no reason to strike § 3553(b)(1) on its face, there is likewise no
            basis for striking any Guideline at issue here on its face. Respondents have not
            established that USSG § 1B1.3(a)(2), § 2D1.1(c)(2), § 3C1.1, or § 1B1.11(b)(2) is
            invalid in all its applications, as Salerno requires. To the contrary, numerous
            applications of these provisions are valid. Such applications include cases in which the
            defendant admits the relevant facts or the jury finds the relevant facts beyond a
            reasonable doubt. Like § 3553(b)(1), USSG §§ 1B1.3(a)(2), 2D1.1(c)(2), 3C1.1, and
            1B1.11(b)(2) say nothing about who must find the facts supporting enhancements, or what
            standard of proof the prosecution must satisfy. They simply attach effects to certain
            facts; they do not prescribe procedures for determining those facts. Even § 1B1.1, which
            provides instructions for applying the Guidelines, directs an order in which the various
            provisions are to be applied ("[d]etermine the base offense level," § 1B1.1(b), then
            "[a]pply the adjustments," § 1B1.1(c)), but says nothing about the specific procedures a
            sentencing court may employ in determining the base offense level and applying
            adjustments.</p>
         <p>Moreover, there is no basis for facially invalidating § 6A1.3 or Rule 32(c)(1). To be
            sure, § 6A1.3(b) and Rule 32(c)(1) prescribe procedure: They require the judge, acting
            alone, to resolve factual disputes. When Booker was sentenced, § 6A1.3(b) provided that
            "[t]he court shall resolve disputed sentencing factors at a sentencing hearing in
            accordance with Rule 32(c)(1), Fed. R. Crim. P." At the time, the relevant portions of
            Rule 32(c)(1) provided:</p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*319</span> "At the sentencing hearing, the court ... must
         rule on any unresolved objections to the presentence report.... For each matter
         controverted, the court must make either a finding on the allegation or a determination
         that no finding is necessary because the controverted matter will not be taken into account
         in, or will not affect, sentencing." (Emphasis added.) <p>The natural meaning of "the court
            . . . must rule" is that the judge, without the jury, must resolve factual disputes as
            necessary. This Rule of Criminal Procedure, as applied at Booker's sentencing hearing,
            required the judge to make findings that increased Booker's offense level beyond the
            Guidelines range authorized by the jury. The application of the Rule to Booker therefore
            was unconstitutional.</p>
         <p>Nonetheless, the Rule has other valid applications. For example, the Rule is valid when
            it requires the sentencing judge, without a jury, to resolve a factual dispute in order
            to decide where within the jury-authorized Guidelines range a defendant should be
            sentenced. The Rule is equally valid when it requires the judge to resolve a factual
            dispute in order to support a downward adjustment to the defendant's offense level.<span
               class="sup">[6]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Given the significant number of valid applications of all portions of the current
            sentencing scheme, we should not facially invalidate any particular section of the
            Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Guidelines, or the SRA. Instead, we should
            invalidate only the application to Booker, <span class="star-pagination">*320</span> at
            his previous sentencing hearing, of § 3553(b)(1); USSG §§ 1B1.3(a)(2), 2D1.1(c)(2),
            3C1.1, 1B1.1, 1B1.11(b)(2), and 6A1.3(b); and Rule 32(c)(1).</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>Invalidating § 3553(b)(1), the Guidelines listed above, and Rule 32(c)(1) as applied to
            Booker by the District Court leaves the question whether the scheme's unconstitutional
            application to Booker can be severed from the scheme's many other constitutional
            applications to defendants like Fanfan. Severability doctrine is grounded in a
            presumption that Congress intends statutes to have effect to the full extent the
            Constitution allows.<span class="sup">[7]</span>Regan v. Time, Inc., <span

            (1997) (hereinafter Vermeule). The severability issue may arise when a court strikes
            either a provision of a statute or an application of a provision. Severability of
            provisions is perhaps more visible than severability of applications in our case law.
            See, e.g., Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, <span class="citation">

         </p>
         <p>However, severability questions arise from unconstitutional applications of statutes as
            well. Congress often expressly provides for severance of unconstitutional
               applications.<span class="sup">[9]</span>
            <span class="star-pagination">*321</span> This Court has acknowledged the severability
            of applications in striking down some applications of a statute while leaving others
            standing. In Brockett, 472 U. S., at 504-507, the Court invalidated a state moral
            nuisance statute only insofar as it reached constitutionally protected materials,
            relying on the statute's severability clause. And in Tennessee v. Garner, <span
               class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/z7D/tennessee-v-garner/">

               </a>
            </span>, 4 (1985), the Court considered a state statute that authorized police to use
            "`all the necessary means to effect [an] arrest.'" The Court held the statute
            unconstitutional insofar as it allowed the use of deadly force against an unarmed,
            nondangerous suspect; but it declined to invalidate the statute on its face,
            specifically noting that the statute could be applied constitutionally in other
            circumstances. Id., at 11-12. In Brockett and Garner, then, the Court recognized that
            the unconstitutional applications of the statutes were severable from the constitutional
            applications. The Court fashioned the remedy narrowly, in keeping with the usual
            presumption of severability.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*322</span> I thus disagree with JUSTICE STEVENS that
            severability analysis does not apply. Ante, at 280-281, and n. 6 (opinion dissenting in
               part).<span class="sup">[10]</span> I acknowledge that, as a general matter, the
            Court often disposes of as-applied challenges to a statute by simply invalidating
            particular applications of the statute, without saying anything at all about
            severability. See United States v. Grace, <span class="citation">

            (REHNQUIST, C. J., joined by SCALIA and THOMAS, JJ., dissenting) (expressing view that
            injunction against honoraria ban should be tailored to unconstitutional
            applications).</p>
         <p>Such decisions (in which the Court is silent as to applications not before it) might be
            viewed as having conducted an implicit severability analysis. See id., at 485-489
            (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). A better view is
            that the parties in those cases could have raised the issue of severability, but did not
            bother, because (as is often the case) there was no arguable reason to defeat the
            presumption of severability. The unconstitutional applications of the statute were fully
            independent of <span class="star-pagination">*323</span> and severable from the
            remaining constitutional applications. Here, the question is squarely presented: The
            parties press it, and there is extraordinary reason to clarify the remedy, namely, that
            our decision potentially affects every sentencing by the federal courts.</p>
         <p>I therefore proceed to the severability question&#x97;whether the unconstitutional
            application of § 3553(b)(1); USSG §§ 1B1.3, 2D1.1(c)(2), 3C1.1, 1B1.1, 1B1.11(b)(2), and
            6A1.3; and Rule 32(c)(1) to Booker is severable from the constitutional applications of
            these provisions. That is, even though we have invalidated the application of these
            provisions to Booker, may other defendants be sentenced pursuant to them? We presume
            that the unconstitutional application is severable. See, e.g., Regan, 468 U. S., at 653.
            This presumption is a manifestation of Salerno's general rule that we should not strike
            a statute on its face unless it is invalid in all its applications. Unless the
            Legislature clearly would not have enacted the constitutional applications independently
            of the unconstitutional application, the Court leaves the constitutional applications
            standing. 468 U. S., at 653.</p>
         <p>Here, the presumption of severability has not been overcome. In light of the significant
            number of constitutional applications of the scheme, it is far from clear that Congress
            would not have passed the SRA or allowed Rule 32 to take effect, or that the Commission
            would not have promulgated the particular Guidelines at issue, had either body known
            that the application of the scheme to Booker was unconstitutional. Ante, at 274-279
            (STEVENS, J., dissenting in part). As noted above, many applications of the Guidelines
            are constitutional: The defendant may admit the necessary facts; the Government may not
            seek enhancements beyond the offense level supported by the jury's verdict; the judge
            may find facts supporting an enhancement but (taking advantage of the overlap in
            Guidelines ranges) sentence the defendant within the jury-authorized range; or the jury
            may find the necessary facts.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*324</span> Certainly it is not obvious that Congress
            would have preferred the entirely discretionary system that the majority fashions. The
            text and structure of the SRA show that Congress meant the Guidelines to bind judges.
            One of the purposes of the Commission, as set forth in the SRA, was to</p> "provide
         certainty and fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing, avoiding unwarranted
         sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of
         similar criminal conduct while maintaining sufficient flexibility to permit individualized
         sentences when warranted by mitigating or aggravating factors not taken into account in the
         establishment of general sentencing practices." 28 U. S. C. § 991(b)(1)(B) (emphases
         added). <p>Accordingly, Congress made the Guidelines mandatory and closely circumscribed
            courts' authority to depart from the Guidelines range. 18 U. S. C. A. § 3553(b)(1)
            (Supp. 2004). Congress also limited appellate review of sentences imposed pursuant to
            the Guidelines to instances in which the sentence was (1) in violation of law, (2) a
            result of an incorrect application of the Guidelines, (3) outside the applicable
            Guidelines range, or (4) in the absence of an applicable Guideline, plainly
            unreasonable. § 3742(e) (main ed. and Supp. 2004). Striking down § 3553(b)(1) and the
            Guidelines only as applied to Booker (and other defendants who have received
            unconstitutional enhancements) would leave in place the essential framework of the
            mandatory system Congress created. Applying the Guidelines in a constitutional fashion
            affords some uniformity; total discretion, none. To suggest, as JUSTICE BREYER does,
            that a discretionary system would do otherwise, ante, at 249-253, 264 (opinion of the
            Court), either supposes that the system is discretionary in name only or overlooks the
            very nature of discretion. Either assumption is implausible.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*325</span> The majority says that retaining the SRA and
            the Guidelines "engraft[s]" a jury trial requirement onto the sentencing scheme. Ante,
            at 246 (opinion of BREYER, J.). I am, of course, aware that, though severability
            analysis may proceed "by striking out or disregarding words [or, here, applications]
            that are in the [challenged] section," it may not proceed "by inserting [applications]
            that are not now there"; that would constitute legislation beyond our judicial power.
            United States v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214, 221 (1876). By allowing jury factfinding in some
            cases, however, we are no more "engrafting" a new requirement onto the statute than we
            do every time we invalidate a statute in some of the applications that the statute, on
            its face, appears to authorize. See, e. g., Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S.
            491 (1985). I therefore do not find the "engraftment" label helpful as a means of
            judging the correctness of our severability analysis.</p>
         <p>Granted, part of the severability inquiry is "whether the statute [as severed] will
            function in a manner consistent with the intent of Congress." Alaska Airlines, Inc., 480
            U. S., at 685. Applying the Guidelines constitutionally (for instance, when admissions
            or jury findings support all upward enhancements) might seem at first glance to violate
            this principle. But so would the Government's proposal of applying the Guidelines as a
            whole to some defendants, but not others. The Court's solution violates it even more
            clearly by creating a system that eliminates the mandatory nature of the Guidelines. In
            the end, nothing except the Guidelines as written will function in a manner perfectly
            consistent with the intent of Congress, and the Guidelines as written are
            unconstitutional in some applications. While all of the remedial possibilities are thus,
            in a sense, second best, the solution JUSTICE STEVENS and I would adopt does the least
            violence to the statutory and regulatory scheme.</p>

            <span class="star-pagination">*326</span> I would hold that § 3553(b)(1), the provisions
            of the Guidelines discussed above, and Rule 32(c)(1) are unconstitutional as applied to
            Booker, but that the Government has not overcome the presumption of severability.
            Accordingly, the unconstitutional application of the scheme in Booker's case is
            severable from the constitutional applications of the same scheme to other defendants. I
            respectfully dissent from the Court's contrary conclusion.</p></div>

         <p>JUSTICE BREYER, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE O'CONNOR, and JUSTICE KENNEDY join,
            dissenting in part.</p>
         <p>The Court today applies its decisions in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000),
            and Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296 (2004), to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.
            The Court holds that the Sixth Amendment requires a jury, not a judge, to find
            sentencing facts &#x97; facts about the way in which an offender committed the crime
            &#x97; where those facts would move an offender from lower to higher Guidelines ranges.
            I disagree with the Court's conclusion. I find nothing in the Sixth Amendment that
            forbids a sentencing judge to determine (as judges at sentencing have traditionally
            determined) the manner or way in which the offender carried out the crime of which he
            was convicted.</p>
         <p>The Court's substantive holding rests upon its decisions in Apprendi, supra, and
            Blakely, supra. In Apprendi, the Court held that the Sixth Amendment requires juries to
            find beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of "any fact that increases the penalty for
            a crime" beyond "the prescribed statutory maximum." 530 U. S., at 490 (emphasis added).
            In Blakely, the Court defined the latter term as "the maximum sentence a judge may
            impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the
            defendant." 542 U. S., at 303 (emphasis in original). Today, the Court applies its
            Blakely definition to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. I continue to disagree with the
            constitutional <span class="star-pagination">*327</span> analysis the Court set forth in
            Apprendi and in Blakely. But even were I to accept that analysis as valid, I would
            disagree with the way in which the Court applies it here.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE O'CONNOR, JUSTICE KENNEDY, and I have previously explained at
            length why we cannot accept the Court's constitutional analysis. See Blakely, 542 U. S.,
            at 314-326 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting); id., at 326-328 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting); id.,
            at 328-347 (BREYER, J., dissenting); Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 549-550
            (2002) (KENNEDY, J., opinion of the Court); id., at 569-572 (BREYER, J., concurring in
            part and concurring in judgment); Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 523-554 (O'CONNOR, J.,
            dissenting); id., at 555-556 (BREYER, J., dissenting); Jones v. United States, 526 U. S.
            227, 264-272 (1999) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting); Monge v. California, 524 U. S. 721,
            728-729 (1998) (O'CONNOR, J., opinion of the Court); McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S.
            79, 86-91 (1986) (REHNQUIST, C. J., opinion of the Court).</p>
         <p>For one thing, we have found the Court's historical argument unpersuasive. See Blakely,
            supra, at 323 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting); Apprendi, supra, at 525-528 (O'CONNOR, J.,
            dissenting). Indeed, the Court's opinion today illustrates the historical mistake upon
            which its conclusions rest. The Court reiterates its view that the right of "`trial by
            jury has been understood to require'" a jury trial for determination of "`the truth of
            every accusation.'" Ante, at 239 (opinion of STEVENS, J.) (quoting Apprendi, supra, at
            477; emphasis in original). This claim makes historical sense insofar as an "accusation"
            encompasses each factual element of the crime of which a defendant is accused. See, e.
            g., United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 509-510, 522-523 (1995). But the key
            question here is whether that word also encompasses sentencing facts &#x97; facts about
            the offender (say, recidivism) or about the way in which the offender committed the
            crime <span class="star-pagination">*328</span> (say, the seriousness of the injury or
            the amount stolen) that help a sentencing judge determine a convicted offender's
            specific sentence.</p>
         <p>History does not support a "right to jury trial" in respect to sentencing facts.
            Traditionally, the law has distinguished between facts that are elements of crimes and
            facts that are relevant only to sentencing. See, e. g., Almendarez-Torres v. United
            States, 523 U. S. 224, 228 (1998); Witte v. United States, 515 U. S. 389, 399 (1995);
            United States v. Watts, 519 U. S. 148, 154 (1997) (per curiam); United States v.
            Dunnigan, 507 U. S. 87, 97 (1993); Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 396
            (1989). Traditionally, federal law has looked to judges, not to juries, to resolve
            disputes about sentencing facts. See, e. g., Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(a). Traditionally,
            those familiar with the criminal justice system have found separate, postconviction
            judge-run sentencing procedures sensible given the difficulty of obtaining relevant
            sentencing information before the moment of conviction. They have found those
            proceedings practical given the impracticality of the alternatives, say, two-stage
            (guilt, sentence) jury procedures. See, e. g., Judicial Conference of the United States,
            Committee on Defender Services, Subcommittee on Federal Death Penalty Cases, Federal
            Death Penalty Cases: Recommendations Concerning the Cost and Quality of Defense
            Representation 9-10 (May 1998). And, despite the absence of jury determinations, they
            have found those proceedings fair as long as the convicted offender has the opportunity
            to contest a claimed fact before the judge, and as long as the sentence falls within the
            maximum of the range that a congressional statute specifically sets forth.</p>
         <p>The administrative rules at issue here, Federal Sentencing Guidelines, focus on
            sentencing facts. They circumscribe a federal judge's sentencing discretion in respect
            to such facts, but in doing so, they do not change the nature of those facts. The
            sentencing courts continue to use those facts, not to convict a person of a crime as a
            statute defines it, but to help <span class="star-pagination">*329</span> determine an
            appropriate punishment. Thus, the Court cannot ground today's holding in a
            "constitutional tradition assimilated from the common law" or in "the Magna Carta."
            Ante, at 238-239 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). It cannot look to the Framers for support,
            for they, too, enacted criminal statutes with indeterminate sentences, revealing their
            own understanding and acceptance of the judge's factfinding role at sentencing. See Act
            of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 9, 1 Stat. 112-118.</p>
         <p>Indeed, it is difficult for the Court to find historical support other than in two
            recent cases, Apprendi and Blakely &#x97; cases that we, like lower courts, read not as
            confirming, but as confounding a pre-Apprendi, pre-Blakely legal tradition that
            stretches back a century or more. See, e. g., Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 246
            (1949); cf., e. g., 375 F. 3d 508, 514 (CA7 2004) (case below) ("Blakely redefined
            `statutory maximum'"); United States v. Ameline, 376 F. 3d 967, 973 (CA9 2004) ("Blakely
            court worked a sea change in the body of sentencing law"); United States v. Pineiro, 377
            F. 3d 464, 468-469 (CA5 2004) (same); see also United States v. Penaranda, 375 F. 3d
            238, 243, n. 5 (CA2 2004) (same, collecting cases).</p>
         <p>For another thing, applied in the federal context of mandatory Guidelines, the Court's
            Sixth Amendment decision would risk unwieldy trials, a two-tier jury system, a return to
            judicial sentencing discretion, or the replacement of sentencing ranges with specific
            mandatory sentences. Cf. Blakely, 542 U. S., at 330-340 (BREYER, J., dissenting). The
            decision would pose a serious obstacle to congressional efforts to create a sentencing
            law that would mandate more similar treatment of like offenders, that would thereby
            diminish sentencing disparity, and that would consequently help to overcome irrational
            discrimination (including racial discrimination) in sentencing. See id., at 315-316
            (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). These consequences would seem perverse when viewed through
            the lens of a Constitution that seeks a fair criminal process.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*330</span> The upshot is that the Court's Sixth Amendment
            decisions &#x97; Apprendi, Blakely, and today's &#x97; deprive Congress and state
            legislatures of authority that is constitutionally theirs. Cf. Blakely, supra, at
            326-328 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting); Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 544-545 (O'CONNOR, J.,
            dissenting); id., at 560-564 (BREYER, J., dissenting). The "sentencing function long has
            been a peculiarly shared responsibility among the Branches of Government." Mistretta,
            supra, at 390. Congress' share of this joint responsibility has long included not only
            the power to define crimes (by enacting statutes setting forth their factual elements)
            but also the power to specify sentences, whether by setting forth a range of
            individual-crime-related sentences (say, 0-to-10 years' imprisonment for bank robbery)
            or by identifying sentencing factors that permit or require a judge to impose higher or
            lower sentences in particular circumstances. See, e. g., Almendarez-Torres, supra, at
            228; McMillan, 477 U. S., at 85.</p>
         <p>This last mentioned power is not absolute. As the Court suggested in McMillan, confirmed
            in Almendarez-Torres, and recognized but rejected in Blakely, one might read the Sixth
            Amendment as permitting "legislatures" to "establish legally essential
            [judge-determined] sentencing factors within [say, due process] limits." Blakely, supra,
            at 307 (emphasis in original); cf. Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 228 (distinguishing
            between "elements" and "factors relevant only to ... sentencing," and noting that,
            "[w]ithin limits, the question of which factors are which is normally a matter for
            Congress" (citation omitted)); McMillan, supra, at 88 (upholding a Pennsylvania statute
            in part because it gave "no impression of having been tailored to permit the [sentencing
            factor] finding to be a tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense"). But the
            power does give Congress a degree of freedom (within constraints of fairness) to choose
            to characterize a fact as a "sentencing factor," relevant only to punishment, or as an
            element of a crime, relevant to guilt or <span class="star-pagination">*331</span>
            innocence. The Court has rejected this approach apparently because it finds too
            difficult the judicial job of managing the "fairness" constraint, i. e., of determining
            when Congress has overreached. But the Court has nowhere asked, "compared to what?" Had
            it done so, it could not have found the practical difficulty it has mentioned, Blakely,
            supra, at 307-308, sufficient to justify the severe limits that its approach imposes
            upon Congress' legislative authority.</p>
         <p>These considerations &#x97; of history, of constitutionally relevant consequences, and
            of constitutional authority &#x97; have been more fully discussed in other opinions.
            See, e. g., Blakely, 542 U. S., at 314-326 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting); id., at 327-328
            (KENNEDY, J., dissenting); id., at 328-347 (BREYER, J., dissenting); Harris, 536 U. S.,
            at 549-550, 569-572; Apprendi, supra, at 523-554, 555-556; McMillan, supra, at 86-91. I
            need not elaborate them further.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>Although the considerations just mentioned did not dissuade the Court from its holdings
            in Apprendi and Blakely, I should have hoped they would have dissuaded the Court from
            extending those holdings to the statute and Guidelines at issue here. See Sentencing
            Reform Act of 1984, as amended, 18 U. S. C. § 3551 et seq., 28 U. S. C. § 991 et seq.;
            United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov. 2003) (USSG). Legal logic
            does not require that extension, for there are key differences.</p>
         <p>First, the Federal Guidelines are not statutes. The rules they set forth are
            administrative, not statutory, in nature. Members, not of Congress, but of a Judicial
            Branch Commission, wrote those rules. The rules do not "establis[h] minimum and maximum
            penalties" for individual crimes, but guide sentencing courts, only to a degree,
            "fetter[ing] the discretion of sentencing judges to do what they have done for
            generations &#x97; impose sentences within the broad limits established by Congress."
            Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 396; see <span class="star-pagination">*332</span> also USSG §
            5G1.1; cf. Witte, 515 U. S., at 399 (explaining that the Guidelines range "still falls
            within the scope of the legislatively authorized penalty"). The rules do not create a
            new set of legislatively determined sentences so much as they reflect, organize,
            rationalize, and modify an old set of judicially determined pre-Guidelines sentences.
            See 28 U. S. C. § 994(a); USSG § 1A1.1, editorial note, § 3, pp. 2-4 (describing the
            Commission's empirical approach). Thus, the rules do not, in Apprendi's words, set forth
            a "prescribed statutory maximum," 530 U. S., at 490 (emphasis added), as the law has
            traditionally understood that phrase.</p>
         <p>I concede that Blakely defined "prescribed statutory maximum" more broadly as "the
            maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the
            jury verdict or admitted by the defendant." 542 U. S., at 303 (emphasis omitted). But
            the Court need not read this language as extending the scope of Apprendi. Blakely
            purports to follow, not to extend, Apprendi. 542 U. S., at 301. And Blakely, like
            Apprendi, involved sentences embodied in a statute, not in administrative rules.</p>
         <p>More importantly, there is less justification for applying an Apprendi-type
            constitutional rule where administrative guidelines, not statutes, are at issue. The
            Court applies its constitutional rule to statutes in part to avoid what Blakely sees as
            a serious problem, namely, a legislature's ability to make of a particular fact an
            "element" of a crime or a sentencing factor, at will. See ante, at 230 (opinion of
            STEVENS, J.). That problem &#x97; that legislative temptation &#x97; is severely
            diminished when Commission Guidelines are at issue, for the Commission cannot create
            "elements" of crimes. It cannot write rules that "bind or regulate the primary conduct
            of the public." Mistretta, supra, at 396. Rather, it must write rules that reflect what
            the law has traditionally understood as sentencing factors. That is to say, the
            Commission cannot switch between "elements" and "sentencing factors" at will because it
            cannot write substantive <span class="star-pagination">*333</span> criminal statutes at
            all. See 28 U. S. C. § 994(a); cf. Blakely, supra, at 301-302, 306-307.</p>
         <p>At the same time, to extend Blakely's holding to administratively written sentencing
            rules risks added legal confusion and uncertainty. Read literally, Blakely's language
            would include within Apprendi's strictures a host of nonstatutory sentencing
            determinations, including appellate court decisions delineating the limits of the
            legally "reasonable." (Imagine an appellate opinion that says a sentence for ordinary
            robbery greater than five years is unreasonably long unless a special factor, such as
            possession of a gun, is present.) Indeed, read literally, Blakely's holding would apply
            to a single judge's determination of the factors that make a particular sentence
            disproportionate or proportionate. (Imagine a single judge setting forth, as a binding
            rule of law, the legal proposition about robbery sentences just mentioned.) Appellate
            courts' efforts to define the limits of the "reasonable" of course would fall outside
            Blakely's scope. But they would do so not because they escape Blakely's literal
            language, but because they are not legislative efforts to create limits. Neither are the
            Guidelines legislative efforts. See Mistretta, supra, at 412.</p>
         <p>Second, the sentencing statutes at issue in Blakely imposed absolute constraints on a
            judge's sentencing discretion, while the federal sentencing statutes here at issue do
            not. As the Blakely Court emphasized, the Washington statutes authorized a
            higher-than-standard sentence on the basis of a factual finding only if the fact in
            question was a new fact &#x97; i. e., a fact that did not constitute an element of the
            crime of conviction or an element of any more serious or additional crime. 542 U. S., at
            301-302, 306-307. A judge applying those statutes could not even consider, much less
            impose, an exceptional sentence, unless he found facts "`other than those which are used
            in computing the standard range sentence for the offense.'" Id., at 299 (quoting State
            v. Gore, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/wash/ebch/state-v-gore/">
                  <span class="volume">143</span>
                  <span class="reporter">Wash. 2d</span>
                  <span class="page">288</span>
               </a>
            </span>, 315-316, 21 P. 3d 262, 277 (2001)).</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*334</span> The federal sentencing statutes, however,
            offer a defendant no such fact-related assurance. As long as "there exists an
            aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken
            into consideration by the Sentencing Commission," 18 U. S. C. A. § 3553(b)(1) (Supp.
            2004), they permit a judge to depart from a Guidelines sentence based on facts that
            constitute elements of the crime (say, a bank robbery involving a threat to use a
            weapon, where the weapon in question is nerve gas). Whether departure-triggering
            circumstances exist in a particular case is a matter for a court, not for Congress, to
            decide.</p>
         <p>Thus, as far as the federal statutes are concerned, the federal system, unlike the state
            system at issue in Blakely, provides a defendant with no guarantee that the jury's
            finding of factual elements will result in a sentence lower than the statutory maximum.
            Rather, the statutes put a potential federal defendant on notice that a judge
            conceivably might sentence him anywhere within the range provided by statute &#x97;
            regardless of the applicable Guidelines range. See Witte, 515 U. S., at 399; see also
            Comment, Sixth Amendment &#x97; State Sentencing Guidelines, 118 Harv. L. Rev. 333,
            339-340 (2004). Hence as a practical matter, they grant a potential federal defendant
            less assurance of a lower Guidelines sentence than did the state statutes at issue in
            Blakely.</p>
         <p>These differences distinguish these cases from Apprendi and Blakely. They offer a
            principled basis for refusing to extend Apprendi's rule to these cases.</p>

         <p>[*] JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE SOUTER, JUSTICE THOMAS, and JUSTICE GINSBURG join this
            opinion.</p>
         <p>[1] The questions presented are: </p>
         <p>"1. Whether the Sixth Amendment is violated by the imposition of an enhanced sentence
            under the United States Sentencing Guidelines based on the sentencing judge's
            determination of a fact (other than a prior conviction) that was not found by the jury
            or admitted by the defendant.</p>
         <p>"2. If the answer to the first question is `yes,' the following question is presented:
            whether, in a case in which the Guidelines would require the court to find a
            sentence-enhancing fact, the Sentencing Guidelines as a whole would be inapplicable, as
            a matter of severability analysis, such that the sentencing court must exercise its
            discretion to sentence the defendant within the maximum and minimum set by statute for
            the offense of conviction." E. g., Pet. for Cert. in No. 04-104, p. (I).</p>
         <p>[2] In Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361 (1989), we pointed out that Congress
            chose explicitly to adopt a "mandatory-guideline system" rather than a system that would
            have been "only advisory," and that the statute "makes the Sentencing Commission's
            guidelines binding on the courts." Id., at 367.</p>
         <p>[3] 18 U. S. C. A. § 3553(a) (main ed. and Supp. 2004).</p>
         <p>[4] Watts, in particular, presented a very narrow question regarding the interaction of
            the Guidelines with the Double Jeopardy Clause, and did not even have the benefit of
            full briefing or oral argument. It is unsurprising that we failed to consider fully the
            issues presented to us in these cases. See 519 U. S., at 171 (KENNEDY, J.,
            dissenting).</p>
         <p>[5] We added: "Instead, petitioners argue that the judge might have made different
            factual findings if only the judge had known that the law required him to assume the
            jury had found a cocaine-only, not a cocaine-and-crack, conspiracy. It is sufficient for
            present purposes, however, to point out that petitioners did not make this particular
            argument in the District Court. Indeed, they seem to have raised their entire argument
            for the first time in the Court of Appeals. Thus, petitioners did not explain to the
            sentencing judge how their `jury-found-only-cocaine' assumption could have made a
            difference to the judge's own findings, nor did they explain how this assumption (given
            the judge's findings) should lead to greater leniency." Edwards, 523 U. S., at
            515-516.</p>
         <p>[*] THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE O'CONNOR, JUSTICE KENNEDY, and JUSTICE GINSBURG join this
            opinion.</p>
         <p>[1] We have, on occasion, debated the proper interpretation of various precedents
            concerning facial challenges to statutes. Compare Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S. 41,
            54-55, n. 22 (1999) (plurality opinion), with id., at 78-83 (SCALIA, J., dissenting),
            and United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987). That debate is immaterial to my
            conclusion here, because it borders on the frivolous to contend that the Guidelines can
            be constitutionally applied "only in a fraction of the cases [they were] originally
            designed to cover." United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 23 (1960).</p>
         <p>[2] See also Lodging of Government, Estimate of Number of Cases Possibly Impacted by the
            Blakely Decision, p. 2 (hereinafter Estimate).</p>
         <p>[3] See, e. g., Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, 524 (1989)
            (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (arguing that a statute
            cannot be struck down on its face whenever the statute has "some quite straightforward
            applications [that] would be constitutional"); Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H.
            Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, 977 (1984) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting) ("When a litigant
            challenges the constitutionality of a statute, he challenges the statute's application
            to him.... If he prevails, the Court invalidates the statute, not in toto, but only as
            applied to those activities. The law is refined by preventing improper applications on a
            case-by-case basis. In the meantime, the interests underlying the law can still be
            served by its enforcement within constitutional bounds"); cf. Raines, 362 U. S., at 21
            (this Court should never "`formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is
            required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied'"); Ohio v. Akron Center for
            Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 514 (1990) (plurality opinion) (statutes should not
            be invalidated "on a facial challenge based upon a worst-case analysis that may never
            occur").</p>

            Justice, Criminal Division, to All Federal Prosecutors, re: Guidance Regarding the
            Application of Blakely v. Washington to Pending Cases, p. 8, available at

         <p>[5] See Application of Blakely 9.</p>
         <p>[6] There is a line of cases that some commentators have described as standing for the
            proposition that the Court must engage in severability analysis if a statute is
            unconstitutional in only some of its applications. See Stern 82. However, these cases
            simply hold that a statute that may apply both to situations within the scope of
            Congress' enumerated powers and also to situations that exceed such powers, the Court
            will sustain the statute only if it can be validly limited to the former situations, and
            will strike it down if it cannot be so limited. Compare United States v. Reese, <span

            interstate commerce, and upholding its constitutionality on that basis). These cases are
            thus about constitutional avoidance, not severability. </p>
         <p>In a separate dissent, JUSTICE THOMAS relies on this principle to conclude that the
            proper analysis is whether the unconstitutional applications of the Guidelines are
            sufficiently numerous and integral to warrant invalidating the Guidelines in their
            entirety. See post, at 323. While I understand the intuitive appeal of JUSTICE THOMAS'
            dissent, I do not believe that our cases support this approach. In any event, given the
            vast number of constitutional applications, see supra, at 276, it is clear that Congress
            would, as JUSTICE THOMAS concludes, prefer that the Guidelines not be invalidated. I
            therefore do not believe that any extension of our severability cases is warranted.</p>
         <p>[7] The predicate for the Court's remedy is its assumption that Congress would not have
            enacted mandatory Guidelines if it had realized that the Sixth Amendment would require
            some enhancements to be supported by jury factfinding. If Congress should reenact the
            statute following our decision today, it would repudiate that premise. That is why I
            find the Court's professed disagreement with this proposition unpersuasive. See ante, at
            250 (opinion of BREYER, J.). Surely Congress could reenact the identical substantive
            provisions if the reenactment included a clarifying provision stating that the word
            "court" shall not be construed to prohibit a judge from requiring jury factfinding when
            necessary to comply with the Sixth Amendment. Indeed, because in my view such a
            construction of the word "court" is appropriate in any event, see infra, at 286-287,
            there would be no need to include the clarifying provision to save the statute.</p>
         <p>[8] In Sloan v. Lemon, 413 U. S. 825 (1973), the Court concluded that legislation
            reimbursing parents for tuition paid to private schools ran afoul of the Establishment
            Clause and struck down the law in its entirety, even as applied to parents of students
            in secular schools. The Court did not, as the majority would have us do, strike down
            particular parts of the statute. In Welsh v. United States, 398 U. S. 333, 361-363
            (1970), Justice Harlan, writing alone, concluded that a statutory provision that allowed
            conscientious objectors to be exempt from military service only if their views were
            religiously based violated the Establishment Clause. He then concluded that, rather than
            deny the exception to religiously based objectors, it should be extended to moral
            objectors, in large part because "the broad discretion conferred by a severability
            clause" was not present in the case. Id., at 365. Finally, in Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.
            S. 728, 739, n. 6 (1984), the Court stated the obvious rule that when a statute provides
            a benefit to one protected class and not the other, the Court is faced with the choice
            of requiring the Legislature to extend the benefits, or nullifying the benefits
            altogether. None of these cases stands for the sweeping proposition that where parts of
            a statute are invalid in certain applications, the Court may opine as to whether
            Congress would prefer facial invalidation of some, but not all, of the provisions
            necessary to the constitutional violation.</p>
         <p>[9] The Commissioners went on to note that, "[e]ven if Blakely is found to apply to the
            federal guidelines, the waters are not as choppy as some would make them out to be. The
            viability of the [Guidelines] previously was called into question by some after
            [Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000)]. After an initial period of uncertainty,
            however, the circuit courts issued opinions and the Department of Justice instituted
            procedures to ensure that future cases complied with Apprendi's requirements and also
            left the guidelines system intact." Hearings on Blakely 1.</p>
         <p>[10] This argument finds support in the Government's successful adaptation to our
            decision in Apprendi. After that decision, prosecutors began to allege more and more
            "sentencing factors" in indictments. See supra, at 277. The Government's ability to do
            so suggests that the Guidelines are far more compatible with "jury factfinding" than the
            Court admits. And, the fact that Congress is presumably aware of the Government's
            practices in light of Apprendi, yet has not condemned the practices or taken any actions
            to reform them, indicates that limited jury factfinding is, contrary to the majority's
            assertion, compatible with legislative intent. See ante, at 250 (opinion of BREYER,
            J.).</p>
         <p>[11] See M. Johnson &amp;amp; S. Gilbert, The U. S. Sentencing Guidelines: Results of
            the Federal Judicial Center's 1996 Survey 7-9 (1997) (noting that among federal judges
            and probation officers, there is widespread "frustration with the power and discretion
            held by prosecutors under the guidelines" and that "guidelines are manipulated through
            plea agreements"); Saris, Have the Sentencing Guidelines Eliminated Disparity? One
            Judge's Perspective, 30 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 1027, 1030 (1997); see also Nagel &amp;amp;
            Schulhofer, A Tale of Three Cities: An Empirical Study of Charging and Bargaining
            Practices Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, 66 S. Cal. L. Rev. 501, 560 (1992)
            (arguing that fact bargaining is common under the Guidelines and has resulted in
            substantial sentencing disparities).</p>
         <p>[12] Incidentally, the original version of S. 1437 looked much like the regime that the
            Court has mandated today&#x97;it directed the sentencing judge to consider a variety of
            factors, only one of which was the sentencing range established by the Guidelines, and
            subjected the ultimately chosen sentence to appellate review under a "clearly
            unreasonable" standard. See S. 1437, § 101 (proposed 18 U. S. C. §§ 2003(a), 3725(e)).
            That law was amended twice before it passed, the first time to include a mandatory
            directive to trial judges to impose a sentence within the Guidelines range, and the
            second time to change the standard of review from "`clearly unreasonable" to
            "`unreasonable.'" See Stith &amp;amp; Koh 245 (detailing amendments to S. 1437 prior to
            passage). It is worth noting that Congress had countless opportunities over the course
            of seven years of debate to enact the law the Court creates today. Congress' repeated
            rejection of proposed legislation constitutes powerful evidence that Congress did not
            want it to become law.</p>
         <p>[13] See Stith &amp;amp; Koh 269-270; see also Wilkins, Newton, &amp;amp; Steer,
            Competing Sentencing Policies in a "War on Drugs" Era, 28 Wake Forest L. Rev. 305, 313
            (1993) (same).</p>
         <p>[14] See, e.g., 133 Cong. Rec. 33109 (1987) (remarks of Sen. Hatch) ("[T]he core
            function of the guidelines and the underlying statute ... is to reduce disparity in
            sentencing and restore fairness and predictability to the sentencing process. Adherence
            to the guidelines is therefore properly required under the law except in . . . rare and
            particularly unusual instances . . ."); id., at 33110 (remarks of Sen. Biden) ("That
            notion of allowing the courts to, in effect, second-guess the wisdom of any sentencing
            guideline is plainly contrary to the act's purpose of having a sentencing guidelines
            system that is mandatory, except when the court finds a circumstance meeting the
            standard articulated in § 3553(b). It is also contrary to the purpose of having
            Congress, rather than the courts, review the sentencing guidelines for the
            appropriateness of authorized levels of punishment"); S. Rep. No. 98-223, p. 76 (1983)
            (noting that the Senate Judiciary Committee "resisted [the] attempt to make the
            sentencing guidelines more voluntary than mandatory, because of the poor record of
            States reported in the National Academy of Science Report which have experimented with
            `voluntary' guidelines"); id., at 34-35 (citing the "urgent need for" sentencing reform
            because of sentencing disparities caused "directly [by] the unfettered discretion the
            law confers on [sentencing] judges and parole authorities responsible for imposing and
            implementing the sentence"); id., at 36-43, 62 (cataloging the "astounding" variations
            in federal sentencing and criticizing the unfairness of sentencing disparities).</p>
         <p>[15] Indeed, the Court's contention that real conduct sentencing was the principal aim
            of the SRA finds no support in the legislative history. The only authority the Court
            cites is 18 U.S.C. § 3661, which permits a judge to consider any information she
            considers relevant to sentencing. See ante, at 249-250 (opinion of BREYER, J.). That
            provision, however, was enacted in 1970, see Pub. L. 91-452, § 1001(a), 84 Stat. 951
            (there numbered § 3577), and thus provides no evidence whatsoever of Congress' intent
            when it passed the SRA in 1984. Clearly, Congress thought that real conduct sentencing
            could not effectively address sentencing disparities without a binding Guidelines
            regime. For this reason, traditional sentencing goals have always played a minor role in
            the Guidelines system: "While the thick-as-your-wrist Guideline Manual specifically
            directs sentencing judges to make thousands of determinations on discrete points, not
            once does it expressly direct that a specific decision leading to the applicable
            guideline range on the 256-box grid should or must turn on an individualized
            consideration of the traditional goals of sentencing." Osler, Uniformity and Traditional
            Sentencing Goals in the Age of Feeney, 16 Fed. Sentencing Rptr. 253, 253-254 (2004).</p>
         <p>[16] Although there was no accompanying committee report attached to the PROTECT Act,
            the floor debates over the Act's relevant provisions belie the majority's contention
            that a discretionary Guidelines system is more consistent with Congress' intent than the
            holding I would adopt. See 149 Cong. Rec. S5113, S5121-S5122 (Apr. 10, 2003) (remarks of
            Sen. Hatch) (arguing that the PROTECT Act "says the game is over for judges: You will
            have some departure guidelines from the Sentencing Commission, but you are not going to
            go beyond those, and you are not going to go on doing what is happening in our society
            today on children's crimes, no matter how softhearted you are. That is what we are
            trying to do here.... We say in this bill: We are sick of this, judges. You are not
            going to do this anymore except within the guidelines set by the Sentencing
            Commission"); id., at S5123 ("[T]rial judges systematically undermine the sentencing
            guidelines by creating new reasons to reduce these sentences"); id., at S6708, S6711
            (May 20, 2003) (remarks of Sen. Kennedy) ("The Feeney Amendment effectively strips
            Federal judges of discretion to impose individualized sentences, and transforms the
            longstanding sentencing guidelines system into a mandatory minimum sentencing system. It
            limits in several ways the ability of judges to depart downwards from the
            guidelines").</p>
         <p>[17] Moreover, even if the change to an indeterminate system were necessary, the Court
            could have minimized the consequences to the system by limiting the application of its
            holding to those defendants on direct review who actually suffered a Sixth Amendment
            violation. Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), does not require blind
            application of every part of this Court's holdings to all pending cases, but rather,
            requires that we apply any new "rule to all similar cases pending on direct review."
            Id., at 323. For obvious reasons, not all pending cases are made similar to Booker's and
            Fanfan's merely because they involved an application of the Guidelines.</p>
         <p>[1] Part III of JUSTICE STEVENS's dissent relies in large part on legislative history. I
            agree with his assertion that "[t]he text of the law that actually passed Congress ...
            should be more than sufficient to demonstrate Congress' unmistakable commitment to a
            binding Guidelines system." Ante, at 294. I would not resort to committee reports and
            statements by various individuals, none of which constitutes action taken or
            interpretations adopted by Congress. "One determines what Congress would have done by
            examining what it did." Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, 531 U. S. 533, 560
            (2001) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).</p>
         <p>[2] See, e. g., ante, at 246 (noting that Congress intended the Guidelines system to
            achieve "increased uniformity of sentencing"); ante, at 250 (referring to "diminish[ing]
            sentencing disparity" as "Congress' basic statutory goal"); ante, at 255 ("Congress
            enacted the sentencing statutes in major part to achieve greater uniformity in
            sentencing"); ante, at 267 (referring to "Congress' basic objective of promoting
            uniformity in sentencing"); see also United States Sentencing Commission, Fifteen Years
            of Guidelines Sentencing xvi (Nov. 2004) ("Sentencing reform has had its greatest impact
            controlling disparity arising from the source at which the guidelines themselves were
            targeted&#x97;judicial discretion"); id., at 140 ("[T]he guidelines have succeeded at
            the job they were principally designed to do: reduce unwarranted disparity arising from
            differences among judges").</p>
         <p>[3] Although the Guidelines took pre-existing sentencing practices into account, they
            are the product of policy decisions by the Sentencing Commission &#x97; including, for
            instance, decisions to call for sentences "significantly more severe than past practice"
            for the "most frequently sentenced offenses in the federal courts." Id., at 47. If those
            policy decisions are no longer mandatory, the sentencing judge is free to disagree with
            them.</p>
         <p>[4] The closest the remedial majority dares come to an assertion that the Guidelines
            must be followed is the carefully crafted statement that "[t]he district courts, while
            not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take them into
            account when sentencing." Ante, at 264. The remedial majority also notes that the
            Guidelines represent what the Sentencing Commission "finds to be better sentencing
            practices." Ante, at 263. True enough, but the Commission's view of what is "better" is
            no longer authoritative, and district judges are free to disagree &#x97; as are
            appellate judges.</p>
         <p>[5] Paragraph (e)(1) requires a court of appeals to determine whether a sentence "was
            imposed in violation of law." 18 U.S.C. § 3742. Courts of appeals had of course always
            done this.</p>
         <p>[6] In the face of this immense reality, it is almost captious to point out that some of
            the text of the preserved subsection (f) plainly assumes the binding nature of the
            Guidelines &#x97; for example, the reference to a "sentence ... imposed as a result of
            an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines," § 3742(f)(1) (Supp. 2004), and
            the reference to a "departure . . . based on an impermissible factor," § 3742(f)(2).
            Moreover, paragraph (f)(1) requires the appellate court to "remand . . . for further
            sentencing proceedings" any case in which the sentence was imposed "as a result of an
            incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines." It is incomprehensible how or why
            this instruction can be combined with an obligation upon the appellate court to conduct
            its own independent evaluation of the "reasonableness" of a sentence.</p>
         <p>[7] The four kinds of appeal arise when, respectively, </p>
         <p>(1) the sentence is "imposed in violation of law," §§ 3742(a)(1), (b)(1), (e)(1), (f)(1)
            (main ed. and Supp. 2004);</p>
         <p>(2) the sentence is "imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing
            guidelines," §§ 3742(a)(2), (b)(2), (e)(2), (f)(1);</p>
         <p>(3) the sentence is either above or below "the applicable guideline range," §§
            3742(a)(3), (b)(3), (e)(3), (f)(2); and</p>
         <p>(4) no guideline is applicable and the sentence is "plainly unreasonable," §§
            3742(a)(4), (b)(4), (e)(4), (f)(2).</p>

         <p>[9] Deciding whether a departure from a mandatory sentence (for a reason not taken into
            account in the Guidelines) is "unreasonable" (as § 3742(e)(3) required), or whether a
            sentence imposed for one of the rare offenses not covered by the Guidelines&#x97;though
            surrounded by mandatory sentences for related and analogous offenses&#x97;is "plainly
            unreasonable" (as § 3742(e)(4) required), differs toto caelo from determining, in the
            absence of any mandatory scheme, that a particular sentence is "unreasonable."</p>
         <p>[1] Because the majority invalidates 18 U.S.C.A. § 3553(b)(1) (Supp. 2004) on its face,
            it is driven also to invalidate § 3742(e) (main ed. and Supp. 2004), which establishes
            standards of review for sentences and is premised on the binding nature of the
            Guidelines. See, e.g., § 3742(e)(2) (main ed.) (directing the court of appeals to
            determine whether the sentence "was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of
            the sentencing guidelines"); § 3742(e)(3) (Supp. 2004) (directing the court of appeals
            to determine whether the sentence "is outside the applicable guideline range" and
            satisfies other factors). Given that (as I explain) there is no warrant for striking §
            3553(b)(1) on its face, striking § 3742(e) as well only does further needless violence
            to the statutory scheme.</p>
         <p>[2] Booker's base offense level (supported by the facts the jury found) was 32. See
            United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 2D1.1(c)(4) (Nov. 2003) (USSG)
            (setting the base offense level for the crime of possession with intent to sell 50 to
            150 grams of cocaine base at 32).</p>
         <p>[3] The District Court applied the version of the Guidelines effective November 1,
            2003.</p>
         <p>[4] I take no position on whether USSG § 6A1.3, a policy statement, bound the District
            Court. Cf. Stinson v. United States, <span class="citation">

            </span>, 200-201 (1992). In any case, Rule 32(c)(1), which had the same effect as §
            6A1.3, certainly bound the court.</p>
         <p>[5] In 2002, Rule 32(c)(1) was amended and replaced with Rule 32(i)(3). The new Rule
            provides, in substantially similar fashion, that at sentencing, the court "must&#x97;for
            any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter&#x97;rule on
            the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not
            affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing."
            Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(i)(3)(B) (2003).</p>
         <p>[6] The commentary to § 6A1.3 states that "[t]he Commission believes that use of a
            preponderance of the evidence standard is appropriate to meet due process requirements
            and policy concerns in resolving disputes regarding application of the guidelines to the
            facts of a case." The Court's holding today corrects this mistaken belief. The Fifth
            Amendment requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, not by a preponderance of the
            evidence, of any fact that increases the sentence beyond what could have been lawfully
            imposed on the basis of facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant.</p>
         <p>[7] I assume, without deciding, that our severability precedents&#x97;which require a
            nebulous inquiry into hypothetical congressional intent&#x97;are valid, a point the
            parties do not contest. I also assume that our doctrine on severability and facial
            challenges applies equally to regulations and to statutes. See Reno v. Flores, <span

            also Vermeule 1950, n. 26 ("There is a common misconception that severability analysis
            refers only to the severance of provisions or subsections enumerated or labeled
            independently in the official text of the statute. In fact, however, severability
            problems arise not only with respect to different sections, clauses or provisions of a
            statute, but also with respect to applications of a particular statutory provision when
            some (but not all) of those applications are unconstitutional"); Stern, Separability and
            Separability Clauses in the Supreme Court, 51 Harv. L. Rev. 76, 78-79 (1937) ("One [type
            of severability question] relates to situations in which some applications of the same
            language in a statute are valid and other applications invalid").</p>
         <p>[10] I do, however, agree with JUSTICE STEVENS that JUSTICE BREYER grossly distorts
            severability analysis by using severability principles to determine which provisions the
            Court should strike as unconstitutional. Ante, at 281-284 (STEVENS, J., dissenting in
            part). JUSTICE BREYER's severability analysis asks which provisions must be cut from the
            statute to fix the constitutional problem. Ante, at 245-249, 258 (opinion of the Court).
            Normally, however, a court (1) declares a provision or application unconstitutional,
            using substantive constitutional doctrine (not severability doctrine), and only then (2)
            asks (under severability principles) whether the remainder of the Act can be left
            standing. JUSTICE BREYER skips the first step, which is a necessary precursor to proper
            severability analysis.</p>
