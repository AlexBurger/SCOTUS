            <span class="star-pagination">*298</span> JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the
            Court.</p>
         <p>Petitioner Ralph Howard Blakely, Jr., pleaded guilty to the kidnaping of his estranged
            wife. The facts admitted in his plea, standing alone, supported a maximum sentence of 53
            months. Pursuant to state law, the court imposed an "exceptional" sentence of 90 months
            after making a judicial determination that he had acted with "deliberate cruelty." App.
            40, 49. We consider whether this violated petitioner's Sixth Amendment right to trial by
            jury.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>Petitioner married his wife Yolanda in 1973. He was evidently a difficult man to live
            with, having been diagnosed at various times with psychological and personality
            disorders including paranoid schizophrenia. His wife ultimately filed for divorce. In
            1998, he abducted her from their orchard home in Grant County, Washington, binding her
            with duct tape and forcing her at knifepoint into a wooden box in the bed of his pickup
            truck. In the process, he implored her to dismiss the divorce suit and related trust
            proceedings.</p>
         <p>When the couple's 13-year-old son Ralphy returned home from school, petitioner ordered
            him to follow in another car, threatening to harm Yolanda with a shotgun if he did not
            do so. Ralphy escaped and sought help when they stopped at a gas station, but petitioner
            continued on with Yolanda to a friend's house in Montana. He was finally arrested after
            the friend called the police.</p>
         <p>The State charged petitioner with first-degree kidnaping, Wash. Rev. Code Ann. §
            9A.40.020(1) (2000).<span class="sup">[1]</span> Upon reaching a plea agreement,
            however, it reduced the charge to second-degree kidnaping involving domestic violence
            and use <span class="star-pagination">*299</span> of a firearm, see §§ 9A.40.030(1),
            10.99.020(3)(p), 9.94A.125.<span class="sup">[2]</span> Petitioner entered a guilty plea
            admitting the elements of second-degree kidnaping and the domestic-violence and firearm
            allegations, but no other relevant facts.</p>
         <p>The case then proceeded to sentencing. In Washington, second-degree kidnaping is a class
            B felony. § 9A.40.030(3). State law provides that "[n]o person convicted of a [class B]
            felony shall be punished by confinement ... exceeding ... a term of ten years." §
            9A.20.021(1)(b). Other provisions of state law, however, further limit the range of
            sentences a judge may impose. Washington's Sentencing Reform Act specifies, for
            petitioner's offense of second-degree kidnaping with a firearm, a "standard range" of 49
            to 53 months. See § 9.94A.320 (seriousness level V for second-degree kidnaping); App. 27
            (offender score 2 based on § 9.94A.360); § 9.94A.310(1), box 2-V (standard range of
            13-17 months); § 9.94A.310(3)(b) (36-month firearm enhancement).<span class="sup"
               >[3]</span> A judge may impose a sentence above the standard range if he finds
            "substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence." § 9.94A.120(2).
            The Act lists aggravating factors that justify such a departure, which it recites to be
            illustrative rather than exhaustive. § 9.94A.390. Nevertheless, "[a] reason offered to
            justify an exceptional sentence can be considered only if it takes into account factors
            other than those which are used in computing the standard range sentence for the
            offense." State v. Gore, <span class="citation">

            the sentence if it finds that "under a clearly erroneous standard there is insufficient

         <p>Pursuant to the plea agreement, the State recommended a sentence within the standard
            range of 49 to 53 months. After hearing Yolanda's description of the kidnaping, however,
            the judge rejected the State's recommendation and imposed an exceptional sentence of 90
            months &#x97; 37 months beyond the standard maximum. He justified the sentence on the
            ground that petitioner had acted with "deliberate cruelty," a statutorily enumerated
            ground for departure in domestic-violence cases. §9.94A.390(2)(h)(iii).<span class="sup"
               >[4]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Faced with an unexpected increase of more than three years in his sentence, petitioner
            objected. The judge accordingly conducted a 3-day bench hearing featuring testimony from
            petitioner, Yolanda, Ralphy, a police officer, and medical experts. After the hearing,
            he issued 32 findings of fact, concluding:</p> "The defendant's motivation to commit
         kidnapping was complex, contributed to by his mental condition and personality disorders,
         the pressures of the divorce litigation, the impending trust litigation trial and anger
         over his troubled interpersonal relationships with his spouse and children. While he
         misguidedly intended to forcefully reunite his family, his attempt to do so was subservient
         to his desire to terminate lawsuits and modify title ownerships to his benefit. <span
            class="star-pagination">*301</span> "The defendant's methods were more homogeneous than
         his motive. He used stealth and surprise, and took advantage of the victim's isolation. He
         immediately employed physical violence, restrained the victim with tape, and threatened her
         with injury and death to herself and others. He immediately coerced the victim into
         providing information by the threatening application of a knife. He violated a subsisting
         restraining order." App. 48-49. <p>The judge adhered to his initial determination of
            deliberate cruelty.</p>
         <p>Petitioner appealed, arguing that this sentencing procedure deprived him of his federal
            constitutional right to have a jury determine beyond a reasonable doubt all facts

         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>This case requires us to apply the rule we expressed in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.
            S. 466, 490 (2000): "Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases
            the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a
            jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt." This rule reflects two longstanding tenets
            of common-law criminal jurisprudence: that the "truth of every accusation" against a
            defendant "should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his
            equals and neighbours," 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 343 (1769),
            and that "an accusation which lacks any particular fact which the law makes essential to
            the punishment is . . . no accusation within the requirements <span
               class="star-pagination">*302</span> of the common law, and it is no accusation in
            reason," 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Procedure § 87, p. 55 (2d ed. 1872).<span class="sup"
               >[5]</span> These principles have been acknowledged by courts and treatises since the
            earliest days of graduated sentencing; we compiled the relevant authorities in Apprendi,
            see 530 U. S., at 476-483, 489-490, n. 15; id., at 501-518 (THOMAS, J., concurring), and
            need not repeat them here.<span class="sup">[6]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*303</span> Apprendi involved a New Jersey hate-crime
            statute that authorized a 20-year sentence, despite the usual 10-year maximum, if the
            judge found the crime to have been committed "`with a purpose to intimidate ... because
            of race, color, gender, handicap, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.'" Id., at
            468-469 (quoting N. J. Stat. Ann. § 2C:44-3(e) (West Supp. 1999-2000)). In Ring v.
            Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 592-593, and n. 1 (2002), we applied Apprendi to an Arizona law
            that authorized the death penalty if the judge found 1 of 10 aggravating factors. In
            each case, we concluded that the defendant's constitutional rights had been violated
            because the judge had imposed a sentence greater than the maximum he could have imposed
            under state law without the challenged factual finding. Apprendi, supra, at 491-497;
            Ring, supra, at 603-609.</p>
         <p>In this case, petitioner was sentenced to more than three years above the 53-month
            statutory maximum of the standard range because he had acted with "deliberate cruelty."
            The facts supporting that finding were neither admitted by petitioner nor found by a
            jury. The State nevertheless contends that there was no Apprendi violation because the
            relevant "statutory maximum" is not 53 months, but the 10-year maximum for class B
            felonies in § 9A.20.021(1)(b). It observes that no exceptional sentence may exceed that
            limit. See § 9.94A.420. Our precedents make clear, however, that the "statutory maximum"
            for Apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of
            the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. See Ring, supra,
            at 602 ("`the maximum he would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in
            the jury verdict alone'" (quoting Apprendi, supra, at 483)); Harris v. United States,
            536 U. S. 545, 563 (2002) (plurality opinion) (same); cf. Apprendi, supra, at 488 (facts
            admitted by the defendant). In other words, the relevant "statutory maximum" is not the
            maximum sentence a judge may impose <span class="star-pagination">*304</span> after
            finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose without any additional findings.
            When a judge inflicts punishment that the jury's verdict alone does not allow, the jury
            has not found all the facts "which the law makes essential to the punishment," Bishop,
            supra, § 87, at 55, and the judge exceeds his proper authority.</p>
         <p>The judge in this case could not have imposed the exceptional 90-month sentence solely
            on the basis of the facts admitted in the guilty plea. Those facts alone were
            insufficient because, as the Washington Supreme Court has explained, "[a] reason offered
            to justify an exceptional sentence can be considered only if it takes into account
            factors other than those which are used in computing the standard range sentence for the
            offense," Gore, 143 Wash. 2d, at 315-316, 21 P. 3d, at 277, which in this case included
            the elements of second-degree kidnaping and the use of a firearm, see §§ 9.94A.320,
               9.94A.310(3)(b).<span class="sup">[7]</span> Had the judge imposed the 90-month
            sentence solely on the basis of the plea, he would have been reversed. See §
            9.94A.210(4). The "maximum sentence" is no more 10 years here than it was 20 years in
            Apprendi (because that is what the judge could have imposed upon finding a hate crime)
            or death in Ring (because that is what the judge could have imposed upon finding an
            aggravator).</p>
         <p>The State defends the sentence by drawing an analogy to those we upheld in McMillan v.
            Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), and Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241 (1949).
            Neither case is on point. McMillan involved a sentencing scheme that imposed a statutory
            minimum if a judge found a particular fact. 477 U. S., at 81. We specifically noted that
            the statute "does not authorize a sentence in excess of that otherwise allowed for [the
            underlying] offense." Id., <span class="star-pagination">*305</span> at 82; cf. Harris,
            supra, at 567. Williams involved an indeterminate-sentencing regime that allowed a judge
            (but did not compel him) to rely on facts outside the trial record in determining
            whether to sentence a defendant to death. 337 U. S., at 242-243, and n. 2. The judge
            could have "sentenced [the defendant] to death giving no reason at all." Id., at 252.
            Thus, neither case involved a sentence greater than what state law authorized on the
            basis of the verdict alone.</p>
         <p>Finally, the State tries to distinguish Apprendi and Ring by pointing out that the
            enumerated grounds for departure in its regime are illustrative rather than exhaustive.
            This distinction is immaterial. Whether the judge's authority to impose an enhanced
            sentence depends on finding a specified fact (as in Apprendi), one of several specified
            facts (as in Ring), or any aggravating fact (as here), it remains the case that the
            jury's verdict alone does not authorize the sentence. The judge acquires that authority
            only upon finding some additional fact.<span class="sup">[8]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Because the State's sentencing procedure did not comply with the Sixth Amendment,
            petitioner's sentence is invalid.<span class="sup">[9]</span>
         </p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>Our commitment to Apprendi in this context reflects not just respect for longstanding
            precedent, but the need to give intelligible content to the right of jury trial. That
            right is <span class="star-pagination">*306</span> no mere procedural formality, but a
            fundamental reservation of power in our constitutional structure. Just as suffrage
            ensures the people's ultimate control in the legislative and executive branches, jury
            trial is meant to ensure their control in the judiciary. See Letter XV by the Federal
            Farmer (Jan. 18, 1788), reprinted in 2 The Complete Anti- Federalist 315, 320 (H. Storing
            ed. 1981) (describing the jury as "secur[ing] to the people at large, their just and
            rightful controul in the judicial department"); John Adams, Diary Entry (Feb. 12, 1771),
            reprinted in 2 Works of John Adams 252, 253 (C. Adams ed. 1850) ("[T]he common people,
            should have as complete a control ... in every judgment of a court of judicature" as in
            the legislature); Letter from Thomas Jefferson to the Abbé Arnoux (July 19, 1789),
            reprinted in 15 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 282, 283 (J. Boyd ed. 1958) ("Were I called
            upon to decide whether the people had best be omitted in the Legislative or Judiciary
            department, I would say it is better to leave them out of the Legislative"); Jones v.
            United States, 526 U. S. 227, 244-248 (1999). Apprendi carries out this design by
            ensuring that the judge's authority to sentence derives wholly from the jury's verdict.
            Without that restriction, the jury would not exercise the control that the Framers
            intended.</p>
         <p>Those who would reject Apprendi are resigned to one of two alternatives. The first is
            that the jury need only find whatever facts the legislature chooses to label elements of
            the crime, and that those it labels sentencing factors &#x97; no matter how much they
            may increase the punishment &#x97; may be found by the judge. This would mean, for
            example, that a judge could sentence a man for committing murder even if the jury
            convicted him only of illegally possessing the firearm used to commit it &#x97; or of
            making an illegal lane change while fleeing the death scene. Not even Apprendi's critics
            would advocate this absurd result. Cf. 530 U. S., at 552-553 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting).
            The jury could not function as circuitbreaker in the State's machinery of justice if it
            were <span class="star-pagination">*307</span> relegated to making a determination that
            the defendant at some point did something wrong, a mere preliminary to a judicial
            inquisition into the facts of the crime the State actually seeks to punish.<span
               class="sup">[10]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The second alternative is that legislatures may establish legally essential sentencing
            factors within limits &#x97; limits crossed when, perhaps, the sentencing factor is a
            "tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense." McMillan, supra, at 88. What this
            means in operation is that the law must not go too far &#x97; it must not exceed the
            judicial estimation of the proper role of the judge.</p>
         <p>The subjectivity of this standard is obvious. Petitioner argued below that second-degree
            kidnaping with deliberate cruelty was essentially the same as first-degree kidnaping,
            the very charge he had avoided by pleading to a lesser offense. The court conceded this
            might be so but held it irrelevant. See 111 Wash. App., at 869, 47 P.3d, at 158.<span
               class="sup">[11]</span> Petitioner's 90-month sentence exceeded the 53-month standard
            maximum by almost 70%; the Washington Supreme Court in other cases has upheld
            exceptional sentences 15 times the standard maximum. See State v. Oxborrow, <span

            There is no answer that legal analysis can provide. With too far as the yardstick, it is
            always possible to disagree with such judgments and never to refute them.</p>
         <p>Whether the Sixth Amendment incorporates this manipulable standard rather than
            Apprendi's bright-line rule depends on the plausibility of the claim that the Framers
            would have left definition of the scope of jury power up to judges' intuitive sense of
            how far is too far. We think that claim not plausible at all, because the very reason
            the Framers put a jury-trial guarantee in the Constitution is that they were unwilling
            to trust government to mark out the role of the jury.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>IV</h2>
         <p>By reversing the judgment below, we are not, as the State would have it, "find[ing]
            determinate sentencing schemes unconstitutional." Brief for Respondent 34. This case is
            not about whether determinate sentencing is constitutional, only about how it can be
            implemented in a way that respects the Sixth Amendment. Several policies prompted
            Washington's adoption of determinate sentencing, including proportionality to the
            gravity of the offense and parity among defendants. See Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 9.94A.010
            (2000). Nothing we have said impugns those salutary objectives.</p>
         <p>JUSTICE O'CONNOR argues that, because determinate sentencing schemes involving judicial
            factfinding entail less judicial discretion than indeterminate schemes, the
            constitutionality of the latter implies the constitutionality of the former. Post, at
            314-323. This argument is flawed on a number of levels. First, the Sixth Amendment by
            its terms is not a limitation on judicial power, but a reservation of jury power. It
            limits judicial power only to the extent that the claimed judicial power infringes on
            the province of the jury. <span class="star-pagination">*309</span> Indeterminate
            sentencing does not do so. It increases judicial discretion, to be sure, but not at the
            expense of the jury's traditional function of finding the facts essential to lawful
            imposition of the penalty. Of course indeterminate schemes involve judicial factfinding,
            in that a judge (like a parole board) may implicitly rule on those facts he deems
            important to the exercise of his sentencing discretion. But the facts do not pertain to
            whether the defendant has a legal right to a lesser sentence &#x97; and that makes all
            the difference insofar as judicial impingement upon the traditional role of the jury is
            concerned. In a system that says the judge may punish burglary with 10 to 40 years,
            every burglar knows he is risking 40 years in jail. In a system that punishes burglary
            with a 10-year sentence, with another 30 added for use of a gun, the burglar who enters
            a home unarmed is entitled to no more than a 10-year sentence &#x97; and by reason of
            the Sixth Amendment the facts bearing upon that entitlement must be found by a jury.</p>
         <p>But even assuming that restraint of judicial power unrelated to the jury's role is a
            Sixth Amendment objective, it is far from clear that Apprendi disserves that goal.
            Determinate judicial-factfinding schemes entail less judicial power than indeterminate
            schemes, but more judicial power than determinate jury-factfinding schemes. Whether
            Apprendi increases judicial power overall depends on what States with determinate
            judicial-factfinding schemes would do, given the choice between the two alternatives.
            JUSTICE O'CONNOR simply assumes that the net effect will favor judges, but she has no
            empirical basis for that prediction. Indeed, what evidence we have points exactly the
            other way: When the Kansas Supreme Court found Apprendi infirmities in that State's
            determinate-sentencing regime in State v. Gould, <span class="citation">

            </span>, 404-414, 23 P. 3d 801, 809-814 (2001), the legislature responded not by
            reestablishing indeterminate sentencing but by applying Apprendi's requirements to its
            current regime. See Act of May 29, 2002, ch. 170, 2002 Kan. Sess. <span
               class="star-pagination">*310</span> Laws pp. 1018-1023 (codified at Kan. Stat. Ann. §
            21-4718 (2003 Cum. Supp.)); Brief for Kansas Appellate Defender Office as Amicus Curiae
            3-7. The result was less, not more, judicial power.</p>
         <p>JUSTICE BREYER argues that Apprendi works to the detriment of criminal defendants who
            plead guilty by depriving them of the opportunity to argue sentencing factors to a
            judge. Post, at 331. But nothing prevents a defendant from waiving his Apprendi rights.
            When a defendant pleads guilty, the State is free to seek judicial sentence enhancements
            so long as the defendant either stipulates to the relevant facts or consents to judicial
            factfinding. See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 488; Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 158
            (1968). If appropriate waivers are procured, States may continue to offer judicial
            factfinding as a matter of course to all defendants who plead guilty. Even a defendant
            who stands trial may consent to judicial factfinding as to sentence enhancements, which
            may well be in his interest if relevant evidence would prejudice him at trial. We do not
            understand how Apprendi can possibly work to the detriment of those who are free, if
            they think its costs outweigh its benefits, to render it inapplicable.<span class="sup"
               >[12]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*311</span> Nor do we see any merit to JUSTICE BREYER's
            contention that Apprendi is unfair to criminal defendants because, if States respond by
            enacting "17-element robbery crime[s]," prosecutors will have more elements with which
            to bargain. Post, at 331, 335-336 (citing Bibas, Judicial Fact-Finding and Sentence
            Enhancements in a World of Guilty Pleas, 110 Yale L. J. 1097 (2001)). Bargaining already
            exists with regard to sentencing factors because defendants can either stipulate or
            contest the facts that make them applicable. If there is any difference between
            bargaining over sentencing factors and bargaining over elements, the latter probably
            favors the defendant. Every new element that a prosecutor can threaten to charge is also
            an element that a defendant can threaten to contest at trial and make the prosecutor
            prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, given the sprawling scope of most criminal
            codes, and the power to affect sentences by making (even nonbinding) sentencing
            recommendations, there is already no shortage of in terrorem tools at prosecutors'
            disposal. See King &amp;amp; Klein, Apprendi and Plea Bargaining, 54 Stan. L. Rev. 295,
            296 (2001) ("Every prosecutorial bargaining chip mentioned by Professor Bibas existed
            pre-Apprendi exactly as it does post-Apprendi").</p>
         <p>Any evaluation of Apprendi's "fairness" to criminal defendants must compare it with the
            regime it replaced, in which a defendant, with no warning in either his indictment or
            plea, would routinely see his maximum potential sentence balloon from as little as five
            years to as much as life imprisonment, see 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(A), (D),<span
               class="sup">[13]</span> based not on <span class="star-pagination">*312</span> facts
            proved to his peers beyond a reasonable doubt, but on facts extracted after trial from a
            report compiled by a probation officer who the judge thinks more likely got it right
            than got it wrong. We can conceive of no measure of fairness that would find more fault
            in the utterly speculative bargaining effects JUSTICE BREYER identifies than in the
            regime he champions. Suffice it to say that, if such a measure exists, it is not the one
            the Framers left us with.</p>
         <p>The implausibility of JUSTICE BREYER'S contention that Apprendi is unfair to criminal
            defendants is exposed by the lineup of amici in this case. It is hard to believe that
            the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers was somehow duped into arguing for
            the wrong side. JUSTICE BREYER'S only authority asking that defendants be protected from
            Apprendi is an article written not by a criminal defense lawyer but by a law professor
            and former prosecutor. See post, at 331 (citing Bibas, supra); Association of American
            Law Schools Directory of Law Teachers 2003-2004, p. 319.</p>
         <p>JUSTICE BREYER also claims that Apprendi will attenuate the connection between "real
            criminal conduct and real punishment" by encouraging plea bargaining and by restricting
            alternatives to adversarial factfinding. Post, at 334, 338-339. The short answer to the
            former point (even assuming the questionable premise that Apprendi does encourage plea
            bargaining, but see supra, at 311, and n. 12) is that the Sixth Amendment was not
            written for the benefit of those who choose to forgo its protection. It guarantees the
            right to jury trial. It does not guarantee that a particular number of jury trials will
            actually take place. That more defendants elect to waive that right (because, for
            example, government at the moment is not particularly oppressive) does not prove that a
            constitutional provision guaranteeing availability of that option is disserved.</p>
         <p>JUSTICE BREYER'S more general argument&#x97;that Apprendi undermines alternatives to
            adversarial factfinding&#x97; <span class="star-pagination">*313</span> is not so much a
            criticism of Apprendi as an assault on jury trial generally. His esteem for
            "nonadversarial" truth-seeking processes, post, at 339, supports just as well an
            argument against either. Our Constitution and the common-law traditions it entrenches,
            however, do not admit the contention that facts are better discovered by judicial
            inquisition than by adversarial testing before a jury. See 3 Blackstone, Commentaries,
            at 373-374, 379-381. JUSTICE BREYER may be convinced of the equity of the regime he
            favors, but his views are not the ones we are bound to uphold.</p>
         <p>Ultimately, our decision cannot turn on whether or to what degree trial by jury impairs
            the efficiency or fairness of criminal justice. One can certainly argue that both these
            values would be better served by leaving justice entirely in the hands of professionals;
            many nations of the world, particularly those following civil-law traditions, take just
            that course. There is not one shred of doubt, however, about the Framers' paradigm for
            criminal justice: not the civil-law ideal of administrative perfection, but the
            common-law ideal of limited state power accomplished by strict division of authority
            between judge and jury. As Apprendi held, every defendant has the right to insist that
            the prosecutor prove to a jury all facts legally essential to the punishment. Under the
            dissenters' alternative, he has no such right. That should be the end of the matter.</p>

            JUSTICE KENNEDY join as to all but Part IV-B, dissenting.</p>
         <p>The legacy of today's opinion, whether intended or not, will be the consolidation of
            sentencing power in the State and Federal Judiciaries. The Court says to Congress and
            state legislatures: If you want to constrain the sentencing discretion of judges and
            bring some uniformity to sentencing, it will cost you&#x97;dearly. Congress and States,
            faced with the burdens imposed by the extension of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466
            (2000), to the present context, will either trim or eliminate altogether their
            sentencing guidelines schemes and, with them, 20 years of sentencing reform. It is thus
            of little moment that the majority does not expressly declare guidelines schemes
            unconstitutional, ante, at 308; for, as residents of "Apprendi-land" are fond of saying,
            "the relevant inquiry is one not of form, but of effect." Apprendi, supra, at 494; Ring
            v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 613 (2002) (SCALIA, J., concurring). The "effect" of today's
            decision will be greater judicial discretion and less uniformity in sentencing. Because
            I find it implausible that the Framers would have considered such a result to be
            required by the Due Process Clause or the Sixth Amendment, and because the practical
            consequences of today's decision may be disastrous, I respectfully dissent.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>One need look no further than the history leading up to and following the enactment of
            Washington's guidelines <span class="star-pagination">*315</span> scheme to appreciate
            the damage that today's decision will cause. Prior to 1981, Washington, like most other
            States and the Federal Government, employed an indeterminate sentencing scheme.
            Washington's criminal code separated all felonies into three broad categories: "class
            A," carrying a sentence of 20 years to life; "class B," carrying a sentence of 0 to 10
            years; and "class C," carrying a sentence of 0 to 5 years. Wash. Rev. Code Ann. §
            9A.20.020 (2000); see also Sentencing Reform Act of 1981, 1981 Wash. Laws ch. 137, p.
            534. Sentencing judges, in conjunction with parole boards, had virtually unfettered
            discretion to sentence defendants to prison terms falling anywhere within the statutory
            range, including probation&#x97;i. e., no jail sentence at all. Wash. Rev. Code Ann. §§
            9.95.010-9.95.011; Boerner &amp;amp; Lieb, Sentencing Reform in the Other Washington, 28
            Crime and Justice 71, 73 (M. Tonry ed. 2001) (hereinafter Boerner &amp;amp; Lieb)
            ("Judges were authorized to choose between prison and probation with few exceptions,
            subject only to review for abuse of discretion"). See also D. Boerner, Sentencing in
            Washington § 2.4, pp. 2-27 to 2-28 (1985).</p>
         <p>This system of unguided discretion inevitably resulted in severe disparities in
            sentences received and served by defendants committing the same offense and having
            similar criminal histories. Boerner &amp;amp; Lieb 126-127; cf. S. Rep. No. 98-225, p.
            38 (1983) (Senate Report on precursor to federal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984)
            ("[E]very day Federal judges mete out an unjustifiably wide range of sentences to
            offenders with similar histories, convicted of similar crimes, committed under similar
            circumstances.... These disparities, whether they occur at the time of the initial
            sentencing or at the parole stage, can be traced directly to the unfettered discretion
            the law confers on those judges and parole authorities responsible for imposing and
            implementing the sentence"). Indeed, rather than reflect legally relevant criteria,
            these disparities too often were correlated with constitutionally suspect variables such
            as race. Boerner &amp;amp; Lieb <span class="star-pagination">*316</span> 126-128. See
            also Breyer, The Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Key Compromises Upon Which They
            Rest, 17 Hofstra L. Rev. 1, 5 (1988) (elimination of racial disparity one reason behind
            Congress' creation of the Federal Sentencing Commission).</p>
         <p>To counteract these trends, the state legislature passed the Sentencing Reform Act of
            1981. The Act had the laudable purposes of "mak[ing] the criminal justice system
            accountable to the public," and "[e]nsur[ing] that the punishment for a criminal offense
            is proportionate to the seriousness of the offense ... [and] commensurate with the
            punishment imposed on others committing similar offenses." Wash. Rev. Code Ann. §
            9.94A.010 (2000). The Act neither increased any of the statutory sentencing ranges for
            the three types of felonies (though it did eliminate the statutory mandatory minimum for
            class A felonies), nor reclassified any substantive offenses. 1981 Wash. Laws ch. 137,
            p. 534. It merely placed meaningful constraints on discretion to sentence offenders
            within the statutory ranges, and eliminated parole. There is thus no evidence that the
            legislature was attempting to manipulate the statutory elements of criminal offenses or
            to circumvent the procedural protections of the Bill of Rights. Rather, lawmakers were
            trying to bring some much-needed uniformity, transparency, and accountability to an
            otherwise "`labyrinthine' sentencing and corrections system that `lack[ed] any principle
            except unguided discretion.'" Boerner &amp;amp; Lieb 73 (quoting F. Zimring, Making the
            Punishment Fit the Crime: A Consumers' Guide to Sentencing Reform, Occasional Paper No.
            12, p. 6 (1977)).</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>Far from disregarding principles of due process and the jury trial right, as the
            majority today suggests, Washington's reform has served them. Before passage of the Act,
            a defendant charged with second degree kidnaping, like petitioner, had no idea whether
            he would receive a 10-year sentence <span class="star-pagination">*317</span> or
            probation. The ultimate sentencing determination could turn as much on the
            idiosyncracies of a particular judge as on the specifics of the defendant's crime or
            background. A defendant did not know what facts, if any, about his offense or his
            history would be considered relevant by the sentencing judge or by the parole board.
            After passage of the Act, a defendant charged with second degree kidnaping knows what
            his presumptive sentence will be; he has a good idea of the types of factors that a
            sentencing judge can and will consider when deciding whether to sentence him outside
            that range; he is guaranteed meaningful appellate review to protect against an arbitrary
            sentence. Boerner &amp;amp; Lieb 93 ("By consulting one sheet, practitioners could
            identify the applicable scoring rules for criminal history, the sentencing range, and
            the available sentencing options for each case"). Criminal defendants still face the
            same statutory maximum sentences, but they now at least know, much more than before, the
            real consequences of their actions.</p>
         <p>Washington's move to a system of guided discretion has served equal protection
            principles as well. Over the past 20 years, there has been a substantial reduction in
            racial disparity in sentencing across the State. Id., at 126 (Racial disparities that do
            exist "are accounted for by differences in legally relevant variables&#x97;the offense
            of conviction and prior criminal record"); id., at 127 ("[J]udicial authority to impose
            exceptional sentences under the court's departure authority shows little evidence of
            disparity correlated with race"). The reduction is directly traceable to the
            constraining effects of the guidelines&#x97;namely, its "presumptive range[s]" and
            limits on the imposition of "exceptional sentences" outside of those ranges. Id., at
            128. For instance, sentencing judges still retain unreviewable discretion in first-time
            offender cases and in certain sex offender cases to impose alternative sentences that
            are far more lenient than those contemplated by the guidelines. To the extent that
            unjustifiable racial disparities have persisted in Washington, it <span
               class="star-pagination">*318</span> has been in the imposition of such alternative
            sentences: "The lesson is powerful: racial disparity is correlated with unstructured and
            unreviewed discretion." Ibid.; see also Washington State Minority and Justice
            Commission, R. Crutchfield, J. Weis, R. Engen, &amp;amp; R. Gainey, Racial/Ethnic
            Disparities and Exceptional Sentences in Washington State, Final Report 51-53 (Sept.
            1993) ("[E]xceptional sentences are not a major source of racial disparities in
            sentencing").</p>
         <p>The majority does not, because it cannot, disagree that determinate sentencing schemes,
            like Washington's, serve important constitutional values. Ante, at 308. Thus, the
            majority says: "[t]his case is not about whether determinate sentencing is
            constitutional, only about how it can be implemented in a way that respects the Sixth
            Amendment." Ibid. But extension of Apprendi to the present context will impose
            significant costs on a legislature's determination that a particular fact, not
            historically an element, warrants a higher sentence. While not a constitutional
            prohibition on guidelines schemes, the majority's decision today exacts a substantial
            constitutional tax.</p>
         <p>The costs are substantial and real. Under the majority's approach, any fact that
            increases the upper bound on a judge's sentencing discretion is an element of the
            offense. Thus, facts that historically have been taken into account by sentencing judges
            to assess a sentence within a broad range&#x97;such as drug quantity, role in the
            offense, risk of bodily harm&#x97;all must now be charged in an indictment and submitted
            to a jury, In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970), simply because it is the legislature,
            rather than the judge, that constrains the extent to which such facts may be used to
            impose a sentence within a pre-existing statutory range.</p>
         <p>While that alone is enough to threaten the continued use of sentencing guidelines
            schemes, there are additional costs. For example, a legislature might rightly think that
            some factors bearing on sentencing, such as prior bad acts or criminal history, should
            not be considered in a jury's determination of <span class="star-pagination">*319</span>
            a defendant's guilt&#x97;such "character evidence" has traditionally been off limits
            during the guilt phase of criminal proceedings because of its tendency to inflame the
            passions of the jury. See, e. g., Fed. Rule Evid. 404; 1 E. Imwinkelried, P. Giannelli,
            F. Gilligan, &amp;amp; F. Lederer, Courtroom Criminal Evidence 285 (3d ed. 1998). If a
            legislature desires uniform consideration of such factors at sentencing, but does not
            want them to impact a jury's initial determination of guilt, the State may have to bear
            the additional expense of a separate, full-blown jury trial during the penalty phase
            proceeding.</p>
         <p>Some facts that bear on sentencing either will not be discovered, or are not
            discoverable, prior to trial. For instance, a legislature might desire that defendants
            who act in an obstructive manner during trial or post-trial proceedings receive a
            greater sentence than defendants who do not. See, e. g., United States Sentencing
            Commission, Guidelines Manual § 3C1.1 (Nov. 2003) (hereinafter USSG) (2-point increase
            in offense level for obstruction of justice). In such cases, the violation arises too
            late for the State to provide notice to the defendant or to argue the facts to the jury.
            A State wanting to make such facts relevant at sentencing must now either vest
            sufficient discretion in the judge to account for them or bring a separate criminal
            prosecution for obstruction of justice or perjury. And, the latter option is available
            only to the extent that a defendant's obstructive behavior is so severe as to constitute
            an already-existing separate offense, unless the legislature is willing to undertake the
            unlikely expense of criminalizing relatively minor obstructive behavior.</p>
         <p>Likewise, not all facts that historically have been relevant to sentencing always will
            be known prior to trial. For instance, trial or sentencing proceedings of a drug
            distribution defendant might reveal that he sold primarily to children. Under the
            majority's approach, a State wishing such a revelation to result in a higher sentence
            within a pre-existing statutory range either must vest judges with sufficient discretion
               <span class="star-pagination">*320</span> to account for it (and trust that they
            exercise that discretion) or bring a separate criminal prosecution. Indeed, the latter
            choice might not be available&#x97;a separate prosecution, if it is for an aggravated
            offense, likely would be barred altogether by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Blockburger v.
            United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932) (government cannot prosecute for separate offenses
            unless each offense has at least one element that the other does not).</p>
         <p>The majority may be correct that States and the Federal Government will be willing to
            bear some of these costs. Ante, at 309-310. But simple economics dictate that they will
            not, and cannot, bear them all. To the extent that they do not, there will be an
            inevitable increase in judicial discretion with all of its attendant failings.<span

         <p>Washington's Sentencing Reform Act did not alter the statutory maximum sentence to which

            as existed in 1977). Petitioner was informed in the charging document, his plea
            agreement, and during his plea hearing that he faced a potential statutory maximum of 10
            years in prison. App. 63, 66, 76. As discussed above, the guidelines served due process
            by providing notice to petitioner of the consequences of his acts; they vindicated his
            jury trial right by informing him of the stakes of risking trial; they served equal
            protection by ensuring petitioner that invidious characteristics such as race would not
            impact his sentence.</p>
         <p>Given these observations, it is difficult for me to discern what principle besides
            doctrinaire formalism actually motivates today's decision. The majority chides the
            Apprendi dissenters for preferring a nuanced interpretation of the Due Process Clause
            and Sixth Amendment jury trial guarantee that would generally defer to legislative
            labels while acknowledging the existence of constitutional constraints&#x97;what the
            majority calls the "the law must not go too far" approach. Ante, at 307 (emphasis
            deleted). If indeed the choice is between adopting a balanced case-by-case approach that
            takes into consideration the values underlying the Bill of Rights, as well as the
            history of a particular sentencing reform law, and adopting a rigid rule that destroys
            everything in its path, I will choose the former. See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 552-554
            (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting) ("Because I do not believe that the Court's `increase in the
            maximum penalty' rule is required by the Constitution, I would evaluate New Jersey's
            sentence-enhancement statute by analyzing the factors we have examined in past cases"
            (citation omitted)).</p>
         <p>But even were one to accept formalism as a principle worth vindicating for its own sake,
            it would not explain Apprendi's, or today's, result. A rule of deferring to legislative
            labels has no less formal pedigree. It would be more <span class="star-pagination"
               >*322</span> consistent with our decisions leading up to Apprendi, see
            Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998) (fact of prior conviction not
            an element of aggravated recidivist offense); United States v. Watts, 519 U. S. 148
            (1997) (per curiam) (acquittal of offense no bar to consideration of underlying conduct
            for purposes of guidelines enhancement); Witte v. United States, 515 U. S. 389 (1995)
            (no double jeopardy bar against consideration of uncharged conduct in imposition of
            guidelines enhancement); Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990) (aggravating factors
            need not be found by a jury in capital case); Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361
            (1989) (Federal Sentencing Guidelines do not violate separation of powers); McMillan v.
            Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986) (facts increasing mandatory minimum sentence are not
            necessarily elements); and it would vest primary authority for defining crimes in the
            political branches, where it belongs. Apprendi, supra, at 523-554 (O'CONNOR, J.,
            dissenting). It also would be easier to administer than the majority's rule, inasmuch as
            courts would not be forced to look behind statutes and regulations to determine whether
            a particular fact does or does not increase the penalty to which a defendant was
            exposed.</p>
         <p>The majority is correct that rigid adherence to such an approach could conceivably
            produce absurd results, ante, at 306; but, as today's decision demonstrates, rigid
            adherence to the majority's approach does and will continue to produce results that
            disserve the very principles the majority purports to vindicate. The pre-Apprendi rule
            of deference to the legislature retains a built-in political check to prevent lawmakers
            from shifting the prosecution for crimes to the penalty phase proceedings of lesser
            included and easier-to-prove offenses&#x97;e. g., the majority's hypothesized
            prosecution of murder in the guise of a traffic offense sentencing proceeding. Ante, at
            306. There is no similar check, however, on application of the majority's "any fact that
            increases the upper bound of judicial discretion" by courts.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*323</span> The majority claims the mantle of history and
            original intent. But as I have explained elsewhere, a handful of state decisions in the
            mid-19th century and a criminal procedure treatise have little if any persuasive value
            as evidence of what the Framers of the Federal Constitution intended in the late 18th
            century. See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 525-528 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). Because broad
            judicial sentencing discretion was foreign to the Framers, id., at 478-479 (citing J.
            Archbold, Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases 44 (15th ed. 1862)), they were never
            faced with the constitutional choice between submitting every fact that increases a
            sentence to the jury or vesting the sentencing judge with broad discretionary authority
            to account for differences in offenses and offenders.</p>

         <h2>IV</h2>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>The consequences of today's decision will be as far reaching as they are disturbing.
            Washington's sentencing system is by no means unique. Numerous other States have enacted
            guidelines systems, as has the Federal Government. See, e. g., Alaska Stat. § 12.55.155
            (2002); Ark. Code Ann. § 16-90-804 (2003 Supp.); Fla. Stat. § 921.0016 (2003); Kan.
            Stat. Ann. § 21-4701 et seq. (2003); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 769.34 (West Supp. 2004);
            Minn. Stat. § 244.10 (2002); N. C. Gen. Stat. § 15A-1340.16 (Lexis 2003); Ore. Admin.
            Rule § XXX-XXX-XXXX (2003); 204 Pa. Code § 303 et seq. (2004), reproduced following 42
            Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 9721 (Purdon Supp. 2004); 18 U. S. C. § 3553; 28 U. S. C. § 991
            et seq. Today's decision casts constitutional doubt over them all and, in so doing,
            threatens an untold number of criminal judgments. Every sentence imposed under such
            guidelines in cases currently pending on direct appeal is in jeopardy. And, despite the
            fact that we hold in Schriro v. Summerlin, post, p. 348, that Ring (and a fortiori
            Apprendi) does not apply retroactively on habeas review, all criminal sentences imposed
               <span class="star-pagination">*324</span> under the federal and state guidelines
            since Apprendi was decided in 2000 arguably remain open to collateral attack. See Teague
            v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 301 (1989) (plurality opinion) ("[A] case announces a new rule
            if the result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant's
            conviction became final").<span class="sup">[2]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The practical consequences for trial courts, starting today, will be equally unsettling:
            How are courts to mete out guidelines sentences? Do courts apply the guidelines as to
            mitigating factors, but not as to aggravating factors? Do they jettison the guidelines
            altogether? The Court ignores the havoc it is about to wreak on trial courts across the
            country.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B</h2>
         <p>It is no answer to say that today's opinion impacts only Washington's scheme and not
            others, such as, for example, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. See ante, at 305, n. 9
            ("The Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on them"); cf.
            Apprendi, supra, at 496-497 (claiming not to overrule Walton, supra, soon thereafter
            overruled in Ring); Apprendi, supra, at 497, n. 21 (reserving question of Federal
            Sentencing Guidelines). The fact that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines are promulgated
            by an administrative agency nominally located in the Judicial Branch is irrelevant to
            the majority's reasoning. The Guidelines have the force of law, see Stinson v. United
            States, 508 U. S. 36 (1993); and Congress has unfettered control to reject or <span
               class="star-pagination">*325</span> accept any particular guideline, Mistretta, 488
            U.S., at 393-394.</p>
         <p>The structure of the Federal Guidelines likewise does not, as the Government
            halfheartedly suggests, provide any grounds for distinction. Brief for United States as
            Amicus Curiae 27-29. Washington's scheme is almost identical to the upward departure
            regime established by 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b) and implemented in USSG § 5K2.0. If anything,
            the structural differences that do exist make the Federal Guidelines more vulnerable to
            attack. The provision struck down here provides for an increase in the upper bound of
            the presumptive sentencing range if the sentencing court finds, "considering the purpose
            of [the Act], that there are substantial and compelling reasons justifying an
            exceptional sentence." Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 9.94A.120 (2000). The Act elsewhere
            provides a nonexhaustive list of aggravating factors that satisfy the definition. §
            9.94A.390. The Court flatly rejects respondent's argument that such soft constraints,
            which still allow Washington judges to exercise a substantial amount of discretion,
            survive Apprendi. Ante, at 305. This suggests that the hard constraints found throughout
            chapters 2 and 3 of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which require an increase in the
            sentencing range upon specified factual findings, will meet the same fate. See, e.g.,
            USSG § 2K2.1 (increases in offense level for firearms offenses based on number of
            firearms involved, whether possession was in connection with another offense, whether
            the firearm was stolen); § 2B1.1 (increase in offense level for financial crimes based
            on amount of money involved, number of victims, possession of weapon); § 3C1.1 (general
            increase in offense level for obstruction of justice).</p>
         <p>Indeed, the "extraordinary sentence" provision struck down today is as inoffensive to
            the holding of Apprendi as a regime of guided discretion could possibly be. The list of
            facts that justify an increase in the range is nonexhaustive. The State's "real facts"
            doctrine precludes reliance by sentencing <span class="star-pagination">*326</span>
            courts upon facts that would constitute the elements of a different or aggravated
            offense. See Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 9.94A.370(2) (2000) (codifying "real facts"
            doctrine). If the Washington scheme does not comport with the Constitution, it is hard
            to imagine a guidelines scheme that would.</p>

         <p>What I have feared most has now come to pass: Over 20 years of sentencing reform are all
            but lost, and tens of thousands of criminal judgments are in jeopardy. Apprendi, 530 U.
            S., at 549-559 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting); Ring, 536 U. S., at 619-621 (O'CONNOR, J.,

      <div type="dissent" judge="kennedy">
         <p>JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins, dissenting.</p>
         <p>The majority opinion does considerable damage to our laws and to the administration of
            the criminal justice system for all the reasons well stated in JUSTICE O'CONNOR's
            dissent, plus one more: The Court, in my respectful submission, disregards the
            fundamental principle under our constitutional system that different branches of
            government "converse with each other on matters of vital common interest." Mistretta v.
            United States, 488 U. S. 361, 408 (1989). As the Court in Mistretta explained, the
            Constitution establishes a system of government that presupposes, not just "`autonomy'"
            and "`separateness,'" but also "`interdependence'" and "`reciprocity.'" Id., at 381
            (quoting Youngstown Sheet &amp;amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 635 (1952)
            (Jackson, J., concurring)). Constant, constructive discourse between our courts and our
            legislatures is an integral and admirable part of the constitutional design.
            Case-by-case judicial determinations often yield intelligible patterns that can be
            refined by legislatures and codified into statutes or rules as general standards. As
            these legislative enactments are followed by incremental judicial interpretation, the
            legislatures <span class="star-pagination">*327</span> may respond again, and the cycle
            repeats. This recurring dialogue, an essential source for the elaboration and the
            evolution of the law, is basic constitutional theory in action.</p>
         <p>Sentencing guidelines are a prime example of this collaborative process. Dissatisfied
            with the wide disparity in sentencing, participants in the criminal justice system,
            including judges, pressed for legislative reforms. In response, legislators drew from
            these participants' shared experiences and enacted measures to correct the problems,
            which, as JUSTICE O'CONNOR explains, could sometimes rise to the level of a
            constitutional injury. As Mistretta recognized, this interchange among different actors
            in the constitutional scheme is consistent with the Constitution's structural
            protections.</p>
         <p>To be sure, this case concerns the work of a state legislature, and not of Congress. If
            anything, however, this distinction counsels even greater judicial caution. Unlike
            Mistretta, the case here implicates not just the collective wisdom of legislators on the
            other side of the continuing dialogue over fair sentencing, but also the interest of the
            States to serve as laboratories for innovation and experiment. See New State Ice Co. v.
            Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). With no apparent sense
            of irony that the effect of today's decision is the destruction of a sentencing scheme
            devised by democratically elected legislators, the majority shuts down alternative,
            nonjudicial, sources of ideas and experience. It does so under a faintly disguised
            distrust of judges and their purported usurpation of the jury's function in criminal
            trials. It tells not only trial judges who have spent years studying the problem but
            also legislators who have devoted valuable time and resources "calling upon the
            accumulated wisdom and experience of the Judicial Branch ... on a matter uniquely within
            the ken of judges," Mistretta, supra, at 412, that their efforts and judgments were all
            for naught. Numerous States that have enacted sentencing guidelines similar to the one
            in Washington <span class="star-pagination">*328</span> State are now commanded to scrap
            everything and start over.</p>
         <p>If the Constitution required this result, the majority's decision, while unfortunate,
            would at least be understandable and defensible. As JUSTICE O'CONNOR's dissent
            demonstrates, however, this is simply not the case. For that reason, and because the
            Constitution does not prohibit the dynamic and fruitful dialogue between the judicial
            and legislative branches of government that has marked sentencing reform on both the
            state and the federal levels for more than 20 years, I dissent.</p></div>
      <div type="dissent" judge="breyer">
         <p>JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR joins, dissenting.</p>
         <p>The Court makes clear that it means what it said in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S.
            466 (2000). In its view, the Sixth Amendment says that "`any fact that increases the
            penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a
            jury.'" Ante, at 301 (quoting Apprendi, supra, at 490). "`[P]rescribed statutory
            maximum'" means the penalty that the relevant statute authorizes "solely on the basis of
            the facts reflected in the jury verdict." Ante, at 301, 303 (emphasis deleted). Thus, a
            jury must find, not only the facts that make up the crime of which the offender is
            charged, but also all (punishment-increasing) facts about the way in which the offender
            carried out that crime.</p>
         <p>It is not difficult to understand the impulse that produced this holding. Imagine a
            classic example&#x97;a statute (or mandatory sentencing guideline) that provides a
            10-year sentence for ordinary bank robbery, but a 15-year sentence for bank robbery
            committed with a gun. One might ask why it should matter for jury trial purposes whether
            the statute (or guideline) labels the gun's presence (a) a sentencing fact about the way
            in which the offender carried out the lesser crime of ordinary bank robbery, or (b) a
            factual element of <span class="star-pagination">*329</span> the greater crime of bank
            robbery with a gun? If the Sixth Amendment requires a jury finding about the gun in the
            latter circumstance, why should it not also require a jury to find the same fact in the
            former circumstance? The two sets of circumstances are functionally identical. In both
            instances, identical punishment follows from identical factual findings (related to, e.
            g., a bank, a taking, a thing-of-value, force or threat of force, and a gun). The only
            difference between the two circumstances concerns a legislative (or Sentencing
            Commission) decision about which label ("sentencing fact" or "element of a greater
            crime") to affix to one of the facts, namely, the presence of the gun, that will lead to
            the greater sentence. Given the identity of circumstances apart from the label, the
            jury's traditional factfinding role, and the law's insistence upon treating like cases
            alike, why should the legislature's labeling choice make an important Sixth Amendment
            difference?</p>
         <p>The Court in Apprendi, and now here, concludes that it should not make a difference. The
            Sixth Amendment's jury trial guarantee applies similarly to both. I agree with the
            majority's analysis, but not with its conclusion. That is to say, I agree that,
            classically speaking, the difference between a traditional sentencing factor and an
            element of a greater offense often comes down to a legislative choice about which label
            to affix. But I cannot jump from there to the conclusion that the Sixth Amendment always
            requires identical treatment of the two scenarios. That jump is fraught with
            consequences that threaten the fairness of our traditional criminal justice system; it
            distorts historical sentencing or criminal trial practices; and it upsets settled law on
            which legislatures have relied in designing punishment systems.</p>

            (REHNQUIST, C. J.). At the risk of some repetition, I shall set forth several of the
            most important considerations here. They lead me to conclude that I must again
            dissent.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>The majority ignores the adverse consequences inherent in its conclusion. As a result of
            the majority's rule, sentencing must now take one of three forms, each of which risks
            either impracticality, unfairness, or harm to the jury trial right the majority purports
            to strengthen. This circumstance shows that the majority's Sixth Amendment
            interpretation cannot be right.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>A first option for legislators is to create a simple, pure or nearly pure "charge
            offense" or "determinate" sentencing system. See Breyer, The Federal Sentencing
            Guidelines and the Key Compromises upon Which They Rest, 17 Hofstra L. Rev. 1, 8-9
            (1988). In such a system, an indictment would charge a few facts which, taken together,
            constitute a crime, such as robbery. Robbery would carry a single sentence, say, five
            years' imprisonment. And every person convicted of robbery would receive that
            sentence&#x97;just as, centuries ago, everyone convicted of almost any serious crime was
            sentenced to death. See, e. g., Lillquist, The Puzzling Return of Jury Sentencing:
            Misgivings About Apprendi, 82 N. C. L. Rev. 621, 630 (2004).</p>
         <p>Such a system assures uniformity, but at intolerable costs. First, simple determinate
            sentencing systems impose identical punishments on people who committed their crimes in
            very different ways. When dramatically different conduct <span class="star-pagination"
               >*331</span> ends up being punished the same way, an injustice has taken place.
            Simple determinate sentencing has the virtue of treating like cases alike, but it
            simultaneously fails to treat different cases differently. Some commentators have
            leveled this charge at sentencing guidelines systems themselves. See, e. g., Schulhofer,
            Assessing the Federal Sentencing Process: The Problem Is Uniformity, Not Disparity, 29
            Am. Crim. L. Rev. 833, 847 (1992) (arguing that the "most important problem under the
            Guidelines system is not too much disparity, but rather excessive uniformity" and
            arguing for adjustments, including elimination of mandatory minimums, to make the
            Guidelines system more responsive to relevant differences). The charge is doubly
            applicable to simple "pure charge" systems that permit no departures from the prescribed
            sentences, even in extraordinary cases.</p>
         <p>Second, in a world of statutorily fixed mandatory sentences for many crimes, determinate
            sentencing gives tremendous power to prosecutors to manipulate sentences through their
            choice of charges. Prosecutors can simply charge, or threaten to charge, defendants with
            crimes bearing higher mandatory sentences. Defendants, knowing that they will not have a
            chance to argue for a lower sentence in front of a judge, may plead to charges that they
            might otherwise contest. Considering that most criminal cases do not go to trial and
            resolution by plea bargaining is the norm, the rule of Apprendi, to the extent it
            results in a return to determinate sentencing, threatens serious unfairness. See Bibas,
            Judicial Fact-Finding and Sentence Enhancements in a World of Guilty Pleas, 110 Yale L.
            J. 1097, 1100-1101 (2001) (explaining that the rule of Apprendi hurts defendants by
            depriving them of sentencing hearings, "the only hearings they were likely to have";
            forcing defendants to surrender sentencing issues like drug quantity when they agree to
            the plea; and transferring power to prosecutors).</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>
            <span class="star-pagination">*332</span> B</h2>
         <p>A second option for legislators is to return to a system of indeterminate sentencing,
            such as California had before the recent sentencing reform movement. See Payne v.
            Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 820 (1991) ("With the increasing importance of probation, as
            opposed to imprisonment, as a part of the penological process, some States such as
            California developed the `indeterminate sentence,' where the time of incarceration was
            left almost entirely to the penological authorities rather than to the courts");
            Thompson, Navigating the Hidden Obstacles to Ex-Offender Reentry, 45 Boston College L.
            Rev. 255, 267 (2004) ("In the late 1970s, California switched from an indeterminate
            criminal sentencing scheme to determinate sentencing"). Under indeterminate systems, the
            length of the sentence is entirely or almost entirely within the discretion of the judge
            or of the parole board, which typically has broad power to decide when to release a
            prisoner.</p>
         <p>When such systems were in vogue, they were criticized, and rightly so, for producing
            unfair disparities, including race-based disparities, in the punishment of similarly
            situated defendants. See, e. g., ante, at 315-316 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting) (citing
            sources). The length of time a person spent in prison appeared to depend on "what the
            judge ate for breakfast" on the day of sentencing, on which judge you got, or on other
            factors that should not have made a difference to the length of the sentence. See
            Breyer, supra, at 4-5 (citing congressional and expert studies indicating that, before
            the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines were promulgated, punishments for
            identical crimes in the Second Circuit ranged from 3 to 20 years' imprisonment and that
            sentences varied depending upon region, gender of the defendant, and race of the
            defendant). And under such a system, the judge could vary the sentence greatly based
            upon his findings about how the defendant had committed the crime &#x97; findings that
            might not have been <span class="star-pagination">*333</span> made by a "preponderance
            of the evidence," much less "beyond a reasonable doubt." See McMillan, supra, at 91
            ("Sentencing courts have traditionally heard evidence and found facts without any
            prescribed burden of proof at all" (citing Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241
            (1949))).</p>
         <p>Returning to such a system would diminish the "`reason'" the majority claims it is
            trying to uphold. Ante, at 302 (quoting 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Procedure § 87, p. 55 (2d
            ed. 1872)). It also would do little to "ensur[e] [the] control" of what the majority
            calls "the peopl[e,]" i. e., the jury, "in the judiciary," ante, at 306, since "the
            peopl[e]" would only decide the defendant's guilt, a finding with no effect on the
            duration of the sentence. While "the judge's authority to sentence" would formally
            derive from the jury's verdict, the jury would exercise little or no control over the
            sentence itself. Ibid. It is difficult to see how such an outcome protects the
            structural safeguards the majority claims to be defending.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>C</h2>
         <p>A third option is that which the Court seems to believe legislators will in fact take.
            That is the option of retaining structured schemes that attempt to punish similar
            conduct similarly and different conduct differently, but modifying them to conform to
            Apprendi's dictates. Judges would be able to depart downward from presumptive sentences
            upon finding that mitigating factors were present, but would not be able to depart
            upward unless the prosecutor charged the aggravating fact to a jury and proved it beyond
            a reasonable doubt. The majority argues, based on the single example of Kansas, that
            most legislatures will enact amendments along these lines in the face of the oncoming
            Apprendi train. See ante, at 309-310 (citing State v. Gould, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/kan/eeGF/state-v-gould/">
                  <span class="volume">271</span>
                  <span class="reporter">Kan.</span>
                  <span class="page">394</span>
               </a>
            </span>, 404-414, 23 P. 3d 801, 809-814 (2001); Act of May 29, 2002, ch. 170, 2002 Kan.
            Sess. Laws pp. 1018-1023 (codified at Kan. Stat. Ann. § 21-4718 (2003 Cum. Supp.));
            Brief for Kansas Appellate Defender Office as Amicus Curiae 3-7). It is therefore <span
               class="star-pagination">*334</span> worth exploring how this option could work in
            practice, as well as the assumptions on which it depends.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>1</h2>
         <p>This option can be implemented in one of two ways. The first way would be for
            legislatures to subdivide each crime into a list of complex crimes, each of which would
            be defined to include commonly found sentencing factors such as drug quantity, type of
            victim, presence of violence, degree of injury, use of gun, and so on. A legislature,
            for example, might enact a robbery statute, modeled on robbery sentencing guidelines,
            that increases punishment depending upon (1) the nature of the institution robbed, (2)
            the (a) presence of, (b) brandishing of, (c) other use of, a firearm, (3) making of a
            death threat, (4) presence of (a) ordinary, (b) serious, (c) permanent or life
            threatening, bodily injury, (5) abduction, (6) physical restraint, (7) taking of a
            firearm, (8) taking of drugs, (9) value of property loss, etc. Cf. United States
            Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 2B3.1 (Nov. 2003) (hereinafter USSG).</p>
         <p>This possibility is, of course, merely a highly calibrated form of the "pure charge"
            system discussed in Part I-A, supra. And it suffers from some of the same defects. The
            prosecutor, through control of the precise charge, controls the punishment, thereby
            marching the sentencing system directly away from, not toward, one important guideline
            goal: rough uniformity of punishment for those who engage in roughly the same real
            criminal conduct. The artificial (and consequently unfair) nature of the resulting
            sentence is aggravated by the fact that prosecutors must charge all relevant facts about
            the way the crime was committed before a presentence investigation examines the criminal
            conduct, perhaps before the trial itself, i. e., before many of the facts relevant to
            punishment are known.</p>
         <p>This "complex charge offense" system also prejudices defendants who seek trial, for it
            can put them in the untenable <span class="star-pagination">*335</span> position of
            contesting material aggravating facts in the guilt phases of their trials. Consider a
            defendant who is charged, not with mere possession of cocaine, but with the specific
            offense of possession of more than 500 grams of cocaine. Or consider a defendant
            charged, not with murder, but with the new crime of murder using a machete. Or consider
            a defendant who the prosecution wants to claim was a "supervisor," rather than an
            ordinary gang member. How can a Constitution that guarantees due process put these
            defendants, as a matter of course, in the position of arguing, "I did not sell drugs,
            and if I did, I did not sell more than 500 grams," or "I did not kill him, and if I did,
            I did not use a machete," or "I did not engage in gang activity, and certainly not as a
            supervisor" to a single jury? See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 557-558 (BREYER, J.,
            dissenting); Monge, 524 U. S., at 729. The system can tolerate this kind of problem up
            to a point (consider the defendant who wants to argue innocence, and, in the
            alternative, second-degree, not first-degree, murder). But a rereading of the many
            distinctions made in a typical robbery guideline, see supra, at 334, suggests that an
            effort to incorporate any real set of guidelines in a complex statute would reach well
            beyond that point.</p>
         <p>The majority announces that there really is no problem here because "States may continue
            to offer judicial factfinding as a matter of course to all defendants who plead guilty"
            and defendants may "stipulat[e] to the relevant facts or consen[t] to judicial
            factfinding." Ante, at 310. The problem, of course, concerns defendants who do not want
            to plead guilty to those elements that, until recently, were commonly thought of as
            sentencing factors. As to those defendants, the fairness problem arises because States
            may very well decide that they will not permit defendants to carve subsets of facts out
            of the new, Apprendi-required 17-element robbery crime, seeking a judicial determination
            as to some of those facts and a jury determination as to others. Instead, States may
            simply require defendants to plead guilty to all <span class="star-pagination"
               >*336</span> 17 elements or proceed with a (likely prejudicial) trial on all 17
            elements.</p>
         <p>The majority does not deny that States may make this choice; it simply fails to
            understand why any State would want to exercise it. Ante, at 310, n. 12. The answer is,
            as I shall explain in a moment, that the alternative may prove too expensive and
            unwieldy for States to provide. States that offer defendants the option of judicial
            factfinding as to some facts (i. e., sentencing facts), say, because of fairness
            concerns, will also have to offer the defendant a second sentencing jury &#x97; just as
            Kansas has done. I therefore turn to that alternative.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>2</h2>
         <p>The second way to make sentencing guidelines Apprendi-compliant would be to require at
            least two juries for each defendant whenever aggravating facts are present: one jury to
            determine guilt of the crime charged, and an additional jury to try the disputed facts
            that, if found, would aggravate the sentence. Our experience with bifurcated trials in
            the capital punishment context suggests that requiring them for run-of-the-mill
            sentences would be costly, both in money and in judicial time and resources. Cf.
            Kozinski &amp;amp; Gallagher, Death: The Ultimate Run-On Sentence, 46 Case W. Res. L.
            Rev. 1, 13-15, and n. 64 (1995) (estimating the costs of each capital case at around $1
            million more than each noncapital case); Tabak, How Empirical Studies Can Affect
            Positively the Politics of the Death Penalty, 83 Cornell L. Rev. 1431, 1439-1440 (1998)
            (attributing the greater cost of death penalty cases in part to bifurcated proceedings).
            In the context of noncapital crimes, the potential need for a second indictment alleging
            aggravating facts, the likely need for formal evidentiary rules to prevent prejudice,
            and the increased difficulty of obtaining relevant sentencing information, all will mean
            greater complexity, added cost, and further delay. See Part V, infra. Indeed, cost and
            delay could lead legislatures <span class="star-pagination">*337</span> to revert to the
            complex charge offense system described in Part I-C-1, supra.</p>
         <p>The majority refers to an amicus curiae brief filed by the Kansas Appellate Defender
            Office, which suggests that a two-jury system has proved workable in Kansas. Ante, at
            309-310. And that may be so. But in all likelihood, any such workability reflects an
            uncomfortable fact, a fact at which the majority hints, ante, at 310, but whose
            constitutional implications it does not seem to grasp. The uncomfortable fact that could
            make the system seem workable &#x97; even desirable in the minds of some, including
            defense attorneys &#x97; is called "plea bargaining." See Bibas, 110 Yale L. J., at
            1150, and n. 330 (reporting that in 1996, fewer than 4% of adjudicated state felony
            defendants have jury trials, 5% have bench trials, and 91% plead guilty). See also ante,
            at 310 (making clear that plea bargaining applies). The Court can announce that the
            Constitution requires at least two jury trials for each criminal defendant &#x97; one
            for guilt, another for sentencing &#x97; but only because it knows full well that more
            than 90% of defendants will not go to trial even once, much less insist on two or more
            trials.</p>
         <p>What will be the consequences of the Court's holding for the 90% of defendants who do
            not go to trial? The truthful answer is that we do not know. Some defendants may receive
            bargaining advantages if the increased cost of the "double jury trial" guarantee makes
            prosecutors more willing to cede certain sentencing issues to the defense. Other
            defendants may be hurt if a "single-jury-decides-all" approach makes them more reluctant
            to risk a trial &#x97; perhaps because they want to argue that they did not know what
            was in the cocaine bag, that it was a small amount regardless, that they were unaware a
            confederate had a gun, etc. See Bibas, 110 Yale L. J., at 1100 ("Because for many
            defendants going to trial is not a desirable option, they are left without any real
            hearings at all"); id., at 1151 ("The trial right does little good when most defendants
            do not go to trial").</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*338</span> At the least, the greater expense attached to
            trials and their greater complexity, taken together in the context of an overworked
            criminal justice system, will likely mean, other things being equal, fewer trials and a
            greater reliance upon plea bargaining &#x97; a system in which punishment is set not by
            judges or juries but by advocates acting under bargaining constraints. At the same time,
            the greater power of the prosecutor to control the punishment through the charge would
            likely weaken the relation between real conduct and real punishment as well. See, e. g.,
            Schulhofer, 29 Am. Crim. L. Rev., at 845 (estimating that evasion of the proper sentence
            under the Federal Guidelines may now occur in 20%-35% of all guilty plea cases). Even if
            the Court's holding does not further embed plea-bargaining practices (as I fear it
            will), its success depends upon the existence of present practice. I do not understand
            how the Sixth Amendment could require a sentencing system that will work in practice
            only if no more than a handful of defendants exercise their right to a jury trial.</p>
         <p>The majority's only response is to state that "bargaining over elements . . . probably
            favors the defendant," ante, at 311, adding that many criminal defense lawyers favor its
            position, ante, at 312. But the basic problem is not one of "fairness" to defendants or,
            for that matter, "fairness" to prosecutors. Rather, it concerns the greater fairness of
            a sentencing system that a more uniform correspondence between real criminal conduct and
            real punishment helps to create. At a minimum, a two-jury system, by preventing a judge
            from taking account of an aggravating fact without the prosecutor's acquiescence, would
            undercut, if not nullify, legislative efforts to ensure through guidelines that
            punishments reflect a convicted offender's real criminal conduct, rather than that
            portion of the offender's conduct that a prosecutor decides to charge and prove.</p>
         <p>Efforts to tie real punishment to real conduct are not new. They are embodied in
            well-established preguidelines sentencing <span class="star-pagination">*339</span>
            practices &#x97; practices under which a judge, looking at a presentence report, would
            seek to tailor the sentence in significant part to fit the criminal conduct in which the
            offender actually engaged. For more than a century, questions of punishment (not those
            of guilt or innocence) have reflected determinations made, not only by juries, but also
            by judges, probation officers, and executive parole boards. Such truth-seeking
            determinations have rested upon both adversarial and nonadversarial processes. The
            Court's holding undermines efforts to reform these processes, for it means that
            legislatures cannot both permit judges to base sentencing upon real conduct and seek,
            through guidelines, to make the results more uniform.</p>
         <p>In these and other ways, the two-jury system would work a radical change in pre-existing
            criminal law. It is not surprising that this Court has never previously suggested that
            the Constitution &#x97; outside the unique context of the death penalty &#x97; might
            require bifurcated jury-based sentencing. And it is the impediment the Court's holding
            poses to legislative efforts to achieve that greater systematic fairness that casts
            doubt on its constitutional validity.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>D</h2>
         <p>Is there a fourth option? Perhaps. Congress and state legislatures might, for example,
            rewrite their criminal codes, attaching astronomically high sentences to each crime,
            followed by long lists of mitigating facts, which, for the most part, would consist of
            the absence of aggravating facts. Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 541-542 (O'CONNOR, J.,
            dissenting) (explaining how legislatures can evade the majority's rule by making yet
            another labeling choice). But political impediments to legislative action make such
            rewrites difficult to achieve; and it is difficult to see why the Sixth Amendment would
            require legislatures to undertake them.</p>
         <p>It may also prove possible to find combinations of, or variations upon, my first three
            options. But I am unaware of any <span class="star-pagination">*340</span> variation
            that does not involve (a) the shift of power to the prosecutor (weakening the connection
            between real conduct and real punishment) inherent in any charge offense system, (b) the
            lack of uniformity inherent in any system of pure judicial discretion, or (c) the
            complexity, expense, and increased reliance on plea bargains involved in a "two-jury"
            system. The simple fact is that the design of any fair sentencing system must involve
            efforts to make practical compromises among competing goals. The majority's reading of
            the Sixth Amendment makes the effort to find those compromises &#x97; already difficult
            &#x97; virtually impossible.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>The majority rests its conclusion in significant part upon a claimed historical (and
            therefore constitutional) imperative. According to the majority, the rule it applies in
            this case is rooted in "longstanding tenets of common-law criminal jurisprudence," ante,
            at 301: that every accusation against a defendant must be proved to a jury and that "`an
            accusation which lacks any particular fact which the law makes essential to the
            punishment is . . . no accusation within the requirements of the common law, and it is
            no accusation in reason,'" ante, at 301-302 (quoting Bishop, Criminal Procedure § 87, at
            55). The historical sources upon which the majority relies, however, do not compel the
            result it reaches. See ante, at 323 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting); Apprendi, 530 U. S., at
            525-528 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). The quotation from Bishop, to which the majority
            attributes great weight, stands for nothing more than the "unremarkable proposition"
            that where a legislature passes a statute setting forth heavier penalties than were
            available for committing a common-law offense and specifying those facts that triggered
            the statutory penalty, "a defendant could receive the greater statutory punishment only
            if the indictment expressly charged and the prosecutor proved the facts that made up the
            statutory offense, as opposed to simply those facts that made up <span
               class="star-pagination">*341</span> the common-law offense." Id., at 526 (O'CONNOR,
            J., dissenting) (characterizing a similar statement of the law in J. Archbold, Pleading
            and Evidence in Criminal Cases 51, 188 (15th ed. 1862)).</p>
         <p>This is obvious when one considers the problem that Bishop was addressing. He provides
            as an example "statutes whereby, when [a common-law crime] is committed with a
            particular intent, or with a particular weapon, or the like, it is subjected to a
            particular corresponding punishment, heavier than that for" the simple common-law
            offense (though, of course, his concerns were not "limited to that example," ante, at
            302, n. 5). Bishop, supra, § 82, at 51-52 (discussing the example of common assault and
            enhanced-assault statutes, e. g., "assaults committed with the intent to rob"). That
            indictments historically had to charge all of the statutorily labeled elements of the
            offense is a proposition on which all can agree. See Apprendi, supra, at 526-527
            (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). See also J. Archbold, Pleading and Evidence in Criminal
            Cases 44 (11th ed. 1849) ("[E]very fact or circumstance which is a necessary ingredient
            in the offence must be set forth in the indictment" so that "there may be no doubt as to
            the judgment which should be given, if the defendant be convicted"); 1 T. Starkie,
            Criminal Pleading 68 (2d ed. 1822) (the indictment must state "the criminal nature and
            degree of the offence, which are conclusions of law from the facts; and also the
            particular facts and circumstances which render the defendant guilty of that
            offence").</p>
         <p>Neither Bishop nor any other historical treatise writer, however, disputes the
            proposition that judges historically had discretion to vary the sentence, within the
            range provided by the statute, based on facts not proved at the trial. See Bishop,
            supra, § 85, at 54 ("[W]ithin the limits of any discretion as to the punishment which
            the law may have allowed, the judge, when he pronounces sentence, may suffer his
            discretion to be influenced by matter shown in aggravation or mitigation, not covered by
            the allegations of the indictment"); <span class="star-pagination">*342</span> K. Stith
            &amp;amp; J. Cabranes, Fear of Judging: Sentencing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 9
            (1998). The modern history of preguidelines sentencing likewise indicates that judges
            had broad discretion to set sentences within a statutory range based on uncharged
            conduct. Usually, the judge based his or her sentencing decision on facts gleaned from a
            presentence report, which the defendant could dispute at a sentencing hearing. In the
            federal system, for example, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 provided that
            probation officers, who are employees of the Judicial Branch, prepared a presentence
            report for the judge, a copy of which was generally given to the prosecution and defense
            before the sentencing hearing. See Stith &amp;amp; Cabranes, supra, at 79-80, 221, note
            5. See also ante, at 315 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting) (describing the State of
            Washington's former indeterminate sentencing law).</p>
         <p>In this case, the statute provides that kidnaping may be punished by up to 10 years'
            imprisonment. Wash. Rev. Code Ann. §§ 9A.40.030(3), 9A.20.021(1)(b) (2000). Modern
            structured sentencing schemes like Washington's do not change the statutorily fixed
            maximum penalty, nor do they purport to establish new elements for the crime. Instead,
            they undertake to structure the previously unfettered discretion of the sentencing
            judge, channeling and limiting his or her discretion even within the statutory range.
            (Thus, contrary to the majority's arguments, ante, at 308-309, kidnapers in the State of
            Washington know that they risk up to 10 years' imprisonment, but they also have the
            benefit of additional information about how long &#x97; within the 10-year maximum
            &#x97; their sentences are likely to be, based on how the kidnaping was committed.)</p>
         <p>Historical treatises do not speak to such a practice because it was not done in the 19th
            century. Cf. Jones, 526 U. S., at 244 ("[T]he scholarship of which we are aware does not
            show that a question exactly like this one was ever raised and resolved in the period
            before the framing"). This makes <span class="star-pagination">*343</span> sense when
            one considers that, prior to the 19th century, the prescribed penalty for felonies was
            often death, which the judge had limited, and sometimes no, power to vary. See
            Lillquist, 82 N. C. L. Rev., at 628-630. The 19th century saw a movement to a
            rehabilitative mode of punishment in which prison terms became a norm, shifting power to
            the judge to impose a longer or shorter term within the statutory maximum. See ibid. The
            ability of legislatures to guide the judge's discretion by designating presumptive
            ranges, while allowing the judge to impose a more or less severe penalty in unusual
            cases, was therefore never considered. To argue otherwise, the majority must ignore the
            significant differences between modern structured sentencing schemes and the history on
            which it relies to strike them down. And while the majority insists that the historical
            sources, particularly Bishop, should not be "limited" to the context in which they were
            written, ante, at 302, n. 5, it has never explained why the Court must transplant those
            discussions to the very different context of sentencing schemes designed to structure
            judges' discretion within a statutory sentencing range.</p>
         <p>Given history's silence on the question of laws that structure a judge's discretion
            within the range provided by the legislatively labeled maximum term, it is not
            surprising that our modern, pre-Apprendi cases made clear that legislatures could,
            within broad limits, distinguish between "sentencing facts" and "elements of crimes."
            See McMillan, 477 U. S., at 85-88. By their choice of label, legislatures could indicate
            whether a judge or a jury must make the relevant factual determination. History does not
            preclude legislatures from making this decision. And, as I argued in Part I, supra,
            allowing legislatures to structure sentencing in this way has the dual effect of
            enhancing and giving meaning to the Sixth Amendment's jury trial right as to core
            crimes, while affording additional due process to defendants in the form of sentencing
               <span class="star-pagination">*344</span> hearings before judges &#x97; hearings the
            majority's rule will eliminate for many.</p>
         <p>Is there a risk of unfairness involved in permitting Congress to make this labeling
            decision? Of course. As we have recognized, the "tail" of the sentencing fact might
            "wa[g] the dog of the substantive offense." McMillan, supra, at 88. Congress might
            permit a judge to sentence an individual for murder though convicted only of making an
            illegal lane change. See ante, at 306 (majority opinion). But that is the kind of
            problem that the Due Process Clause is well suited to cure. McMillan foresaw the
            possibility that judges would have to use their own judgment in dealing with such a
            problem; but that is what judges are there for. And, as Part I, supra, makes clear, the
            alternatives are worse &#x97; not only practically, but, although the majority refuses
            to admit it, constitutionally as well.</p>
         <p>Historic practice, then, does not compel the result the majority reaches. And
            constitutional concerns counsel the opposite.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>The majority also overlooks important institutional considerations. Congress and the
            States relied upon what they believed was their constitutional power to decide, within
            broad limits, whether to make a particular fact (a) a sentencing factor or (b) an
            element in a greater crime. They relied upon McMillan as guaranteeing the constitutional
            validity of that proposition. They created sentencing reform, an effort to change the
            criminal justice system so that it reflects systematically not simply upon guilt or
            innocence but also upon what should be done about this now-guilty offender. Those
            efforts have spanned a generation. They have led to state sentencing guidelines and the
            Federal Sentencing Guidelines system. E. g., ante, at 314-318 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting)
            (describing sentencing reform in the State of Washington). These systems are imperfect
            and they yield far from perfect results, but I cannot believe the Constitution <span
               class="star-pagination">*345</span> forbids the state legislatures and Congress to
            adopt such systems and to try to improve them over time. Nor can I believe that the
            Constitution hamstrings legislatures in the way that JUSTICE O'CONNOR and I have
            discussed.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>IV</h2>
         <p>Now, let us return to the question I posed at the outset. Why does the Sixth Amendment
            permit a jury trial right (in respect to a particular fact) to depend upon a legislative
            labeling decision, namely, the legislative decision to label the fact a sentencing fact,
            instead of an element of the crime? The answer is that the fairness and effectiveness of
            a sentencing system, and the related fairness and effectiveness of the criminal justice
            system itself, depends upon the legislature's possessing the constitutional authority
            (within due process limits) to make that labeling decision. To restrict radically the
            legislature's power in this respect, as the majority interprets the Sixth Amendment to
            do, prevents the legislature from seeking sentencing systems that are consistent with,
            and indeed may help to advance, the Constitution's greater fairness goals.</p>
         <p>To say this is not simply to express concerns about fairness to defendants. It is also
            to express concerns about the serious practical (or impractical) changes that the
            Court's decision seems likely to impose upon the criminal process; about the tendency of
            the Court's decision to embed further plea bargaining processes that lack transparency
            and too often mean nonuniform, sometimes arbitrary, sentencing practices; about the
            obstacles the Court's decision poses to legislative efforts to bring about greater
            uniformity between real criminal conduct and real punishment; and ultimately about the
            limitations that the Court imposes upon legislatures' ability to make democratic
            legislative decisions. Whatever the faults of guidelines systems &#x97; and there are
            many &#x97; they are more likely to find their cure in legislation emerging from the
            experience of, and discussion among, all elements of the <span class="star-pagination"
               >*346</span> criminal justice community, than in a virtually unchangeable
            constitutional decision of this Court.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>V</h2>
         <p>Taken together these three sets of considerations, concerning consequences, concerning
            history, concerning institutional reliance, leave me where I was in Apprendi, i. e.,
            convinced that the Court is wrong. Until now, I would have thought the Court might have
            limited Apprendi so that its underlying principle would not undo sentencing reform
            efforts. Today's case dispels that illusion. At a minimum, the case sets aside numerous
            state efforts in that direction. Perhaps the Court will distinguish the Federal
            Sentencing Guidelines, but I am uncertain how. As a result of today's decision, federal
            prosecutors, like state prosecutors, must decide what to do next, how to handle
            tomorrow's case.</p>
         <p>Consider some of the matters that federal prosecutors must know about, or guess about,
            when they prosecute their next case: (1) Does today's decision apply in full force to
            the Federal Sentencing Guidelines? (2) If so, must the initial indictment contain all
            sentencing factors, charged as "elements" of the crime? (3) What, then, are the
            evidentiary rules? Can the prosecution continue to use, say, presentence reports, with
            their conclusions reflecting layers of hearsay? Cf. Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S.
            36, 63, 68 (2004) (clarifying the Sixth Amendment's requirement of confrontation with
            respect to testimonial hearsay). Are the numerous cases of this Court holding that a
            sentencing judge may consider virtually any reliable information still good law when
            juries, not judges, are required to determine the matter? See, e. g., United States v.
            Watts, 519 U. S. 148, 153-157 (1997) (per curiam) (evidence of conduct of which the
            defendant has been acquitted may be considered at sentencing). Cf. Witte v. United
            States, 515 U. S. 389, 399-401 (1995) (evidence of uncharged criminal conduct used in
            determining sentence). (4) How are juries to deal with highly complex <span
               class="star-pagination">*347</span> or open-ended Sentencing Guidelines obviously
            written for application by an experienced trial judge? See, e. g., USSG § 3B1.1
            (requiring a greater sentence when the defendant was a leader of a criminal activity
            that involved four or more participants or was "otherwise extensive" (emphasis added));
            §§ 3D1.1-3D1.2 (highly complex "multiple count" rules); § 1B1.3 (relevant conduct
            rules).</p>
         <p>Ordinarily, this Court simply waits for cases to arise in which it can answer such
            questions. But this case affects tens of thousands of criminal prosecutions, including
            federal prosecutions. Federal prosecutors will proceed with those prosecutions subject
            to the risk that all defendants in those cases will have to be sentenced, perhaps tried,
            anew. Given this consequence and the need for certainty, I would not proceed further
            piecemeal; rather, I would call for further argument on the ramifications of the
            concerns I have raised. But that is not the Court's view.</p>
         <p>For the reasons given, I dissent.</p>

         <p>[5] JUSTICE BREYER cites JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S Apprendi dissent for the point that this
            Bishop quotation means only that indictments must charge facts that trigger statutory
            aggravation of a common-law offense. Post, at 340-341 (dissenting opinion). Of course,
            as he notes, JUSTICE O'CONNOR was referring to an entirely different quotation, from
            Archbold's treatise. See 530 U. S., at 526 (citing J. Archbold, Pleading and Evidence in
            Criminal Cases 51, 188 (15th ed. 1862)). JUSTICE BREYER claims the two are "similar,"
            post, at 341, but they are as similar as chalk and cheese. Bishop was not "addressing"
            the "problem" of statutes that aggravate common-law offenses. Ibid. Rather, the entire
            chapter of his treatise is devoted to the point that "every fact which is legally
            essential to the punishment," 1 Criminal Procedure §81, at 51, must be charged in the
            indictment and proved to a jury. Id., ch. 6, at 50-56. As one "example" of this
            principle (appearing several pages before the language we quote in text above), he notes
            a statute aggravating common-law assault. Id., § 82, at 51-52. But nowhere is there the
            slightest indication that his general principle was limited to that example. Even
            JUSTICE BREYER'S academic supporters do not make that claim. See Bibas, Judicial
            Fact-Finding and Sentence Enhancements in a World of Guilty Pleas, 110 Yale L. J. 1097,
            1131-1132 (2001) (conceding that Bishop's treatise supports Apprendi, while criticizing
            its "natural-law theorizing").</p>
         <p>[6] As to JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S criticism of the quantity of historical support for the
            Apprendi rule, post, at 323 (dissenting opinion): It bears repeating that the issue
            between us is not whether the Constitution limits States' authority to reclassify
            elements as sentencing factors (we all agree that it does); it is only which line, ours
            or hers, the Constitution draws. Criticism of the quantity of evidence favoring our
            alternative would have some force if it were accompanied by any evidence favoring hers.
            JUSTICE O'CONNOR does not even provide a coherent alternative meaning for the jury-trial
            guarantee, unless one considers "whatever the legislature chooses to leave to the jury,
            so long as it does not go too far" coherent. See infra, at 305-308.</p>
         <p>[7] The State does not contend that the domestic-violence stipulation alone supports the
            departure. That the statute lists domestic violence as grounds for departure only when
            combined with some other aggravating factor suggests it could not. See §§
            9.94A.390(2)(h)(i)-(iii).</p>
         <p>[8] Nor does it matter that the judge must, after finding aggravating facts, make a
            judgment that they present a compelling ground for departure. He cannot make that
            judgment without finding some facts to support it beyond the bare elements of the
            offense. Whether the judicially determined facts require a sentence enhancement or
            merely allow it, the verdict alone does not authorize the sentence.</p>
         <p>[9] The United States, as amicus curiae, urges us to affirm. It notes differences
            between Washington's sentencing regime and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines but
            questions whether those differences are constitutionally significant. See Brief for
            United States as Amicus Curiae 25-30. The Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we
            express no opinion on them.</p>
         <p>[10] JUSTICE O'CONNOR believes that a "built-in political check" will prevent lawmakers
            from manipulating offense elements in this fashion. Post, at 322. But the many immediate
            practical advantages of judicial factfinding, see post, at 318-320, suggest that
            political forces would, if anything, pull in the opposite direction. In any case, the
            Framers' decision to entrench the jury-trial right in the Constitution shows that they
            did not trust government to make political decisions in this area.</p>
         <p>[11] Another example of conversion from separate crime to sentence enhancement that
            JUSTICE O'CONNOR evidently does not consider going "too far" is the
            obstruction-of-justice enhancement, see post, at 319. Why perjury during trial should be
            grounds for a judicial sentence enhancement on the underlying offense, rather than an
            entirely separate offense to be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt (as it has
            been for centuries, see 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 136-138
            (1769)), is unclear.</p>
         <p>[12] JUSTICE BREYER responds that States are not required to give defendants the option
            of waiving jury trial on some elements but not others. Post, at 335-336. True enough.
            But why would the States that he asserts we are coercing into hardheartedness &#x97;
            that is, States that want judge-pronounced determinate sentencing to be the norm but we
            won't let them &#x97; want to prevent a defendant from choosing that regime? JUSTICE
            BREYER claims this alternative may prove "too expensive and unwieldy for States to
            provide," post, at 336, but there is no obvious reason why forcing defendants to choose
            between contesting all elements of his hypothetical 17-element robbery crime and
            contesting none of them is less expensive than also giving them the third option of
            pleading guilty to some elements and submitting the rest to judicial factfinding.
            JUSTICE BREYER's argument rests entirely on a speculative prediction about the number of
            defendants likely to choose the first (rather than the second) option if denied the
            third.</p>
         <p>[13] To be sure, JUSTICE BREYER and the other dissenters would forbid those increases of
            sentence that violate the constitutional principle that tail shall not wag dog. The
            source of this principle is entirely unclear. Its precise effect, if precise effect it
            has, is presumably to require that the ratio of sentencing-factor add-on to basic
            criminal sentence be no greater than the ratio of caudal vertebrae to body in the breed
            of canine with the longest tail. Or perhaps no greater than the average such ratio for
            all breeds. Or perhaps the median. Regrettably, Apprendi has prevented full development
            of this line of jurisprudence.</p>
         <p>[1] The paucity of empirical evidence regarding the impact of extending Apprendi v. New
            Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), to guidelines schemes should come as no surprise to the
            majority. Ante, at 309. Prior to today, only one court had ever applied Apprendi to
            invalidate application of a guidelines scheme. Compare State v. Gould, <span

            the uncharted territory blazed by today's unprecedented holding.</p>
         <p>[2] The numbers available from the federal system alone are staggering. On March 31,
            2004, there were 8,320 federal criminal appeals pending in which the defendant's
            sentence was at issue. Memorandum from Steven Schlesinger, Administrative Office of the
            United States Courts, to Supreme Court Library (June 1, 2004) (available in Clerk of
            Court's case file). Between June 27, 2000, when Apprendi was decided, and March 31,
            2004, there have been 272,191 defendants sentenced in federal court. Memorandum, supra.
            Given that nearly all federal sentences are governed by the Federal Sentencing
            Guidelines, the vast majority of these cases are Guidelines cases.</p>
