         <p>Justice Stevens, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
         <p>The Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act or Act) creates a right to recover compensatory
            and punitive damages for certain violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
            1964. See Rev. Stat. § 1977A(a), 42 U. S. C. § 1981a(a) (1988 ed., Supp. IV), as added
            by § 102 of the 1991 Act, Pub. L. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1072. The Act further provides that
            any party may demand a trial by jury if such damages are sought.<span class="sup"
               >[1]</span> We granted certiorari to decide whether these provisions apply to a Title
            VII case that was pending on appeal when the statute was enacted. We hold that they do

         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>From September 4, 1984, through January 17, 1986, petitioner Barbara Landgraf was
            employed in the USI Film <span class="star-pagination">*248</span> Products (USI) plant
            in Tyler, Texas. She worked the 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift operating a machine that
            produced plastic bags. A fellow employee named John Williams repeatedly harassed her
            with inappropriate remarks and physical contact. Petitioner's complaints to her
            immediate supervisor brought her no relief,but when she reported the incidents to the
            personnel manager, he conducted an investigation, reprimanded Williams, and transferred
            him to another department. Four days later petitioner quit her job.</p>
         <p>Petitioner filed a timely charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC
            or Commission). The Commission determined that petitioner had likely been the victim of
            sexual harassment creating a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII of the
            Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. § 2000e et seq., but concluded that her employer
            had adequately remedied the violation. Accordingly, the Commission dismissed the charge
            and issued a notice of right to sue.</p>
         <p>On July 21, 1989, petitioner commenced this action against USI, its corporate owner, and
            that company's successor in interest.<span class="sup">[2]</span> After a bench trial,
            the District Court found that Williams had sexually harassed petitioner causing her to
            suffer mental anguish. However, the court concluded that she had not been constructively
            discharged. The court said:</p> "Although the harassment was serious enough to establish
         that a hostile work environment existed for Landgraf, it was not so severe that a
         reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign. This is particularly true in light
         of the fact that at the time Landgraf resigned from her job, USI had taken steps . . . to
         eliminate the hostile working environment arising from the sexual harassment. Landgraf
         voluntarily resigned <span class="star-pagination">*249</span> from her employment with USI
         for reasons unrelated to the sexual harassment in question." App. to Pet. for Cert. B-3-4.
            <p>Because the court found that petitioner's employment was not terminated in violation
            of Title VII, she was not entitled to equitable relief,and because Title VII did not
            then authorize any other form of relief, the court dismissed her complaint.</p>
         <p>On November 21, 1991, while petitioner's appeal was pending, the President signed into
            law the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's argument
            that her case should be remanded for a jury trial on damages pursuant to the 1991 Act.
            Its decision not to remand rested on the premise that "a court must `apply the law in
            effect at the time it renders its decision, unless doing so would result in manifest
            injustice or there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary.'
            Bradley [v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U. S. 696, 711 (1974)]." 968 F. 2d 427, 432 (CA5
            1992). Commenting first on the provision for a jury trial in § 102(c), the court stated
            that requiring the defendant "to retry this case because of a statutory change enacted
            after the trial was completed would be an injustice and a waste of judicial resources.
            We apply procedural rules to pending cases, but we do not invalidate procedures followed
            before the new rule was adopted." Id., at 432-433. The court then characterized the
            provision for compensatory and punitive damages in § 102 as "a seachange in employer
            liability for Title VII violations" and concluded that it would be unjust to apply this
            kind of additional and unforeseeable obligation to conduct occurring before the
            effective date of the Act. Id., at 433. Finding no clear error in the District Court's
            factual findings, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment for respondents.</p>
         <p>We granted certiorari and set the case for argument with Rivers v. Roadway Express,
            Inc., post, p. 298. Our order limited argument to the question whether § 102 of the 1991
               <span class="star-pagination">*250</span> Act applies to cases pending when it became
            law. 507 U. S. 908 (1993). Accordingly, for purposes of our decision, we assume that the
            District Court and the Court of Appeals properly applied the law in effect at the time
            of the discriminatory conduct and that the relevant findings of fact were correct. We
            therefore assume that petitioner was the victim of sexual harassment violative of Title
            VII, but that the law did not then authorize any recovery of damages even though she was
            injured. We also assume, arguendo, that if the same conduct were to occur today,
            petitioner would be entitled to a jury trial and that the jury might find that she was
            constructively discharged, or that her mental anguish or other injuries would support an
            award of damages against her former employer. Thus, the controlling question is whether
            the Court of Appeals should have applied the law in effect at the time the
            discriminatory conduct occurred, or at the time of its decision in July 1992.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>Petitioner's primary submission is that the text of the 1991 Act requires that it be
            applied to cases pending on its enactment. Her argument, if accepted, would make the
            entire Act (with two narrow exceptions) applicable to conduct that occurred, and to
            cases that were filed, before the Act's effective date. Although only § 102 is at issue
            in this case, we preface our analysis with a brief description of the scope of the 1991
            Act.</p>
         <p>The 1991 Act is in large part a response to a series of decisions of this Court
            interpreting the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1964. Section 3(4), 105 Stat. 1071, note
            following 42 U. S. C. § 1981, expressly identifies as one of the Act's purposes "to
            respond to recent decisions of the Supreme Court by expanding the scope of relevant
            civil rights statutes in order to provide adequate protection to victims of
            discrimination." That section, as well as a specific finding in § 2(2), identifies Wards
            Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642 <span class="star-pagination">*251</span>
            (1989), as a decision that gave rise to special concerns.<span class="sup">[3]</span>
            Section 105 of the Act, entitled "Burden of Proof in Disparate Impact Cases," is a
            direct response to Wards Cove. </p>
         <p>Other sections of the Act were obviously drafted with "recent decisions of the Supreme
            Court" in mind. Thus, § 101 (which is at issue in Rivers, post, p. 298) amended the 1866
            Civil Rights Act's prohibition of racial discrimination in the "mak[ing] and
            enforce[ment] [of] contracts," 42 U. S. C. § 1981 (1988 ed., Supp. IV), in response to
            Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164 (1989); § 107 responds to Price
            Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228 (1989), by setting forth standards applicable in
            "mixed motive" cases; § 108 responds to Martin v. Wilks, 490 U. S. 755 (1989), by
            prohibiting certain challenges to employment practices implementing consent decrees; §
            109 responds to EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244 (1991), by redefining
            the term "employee" as used in Title VII to include certain United States citizens
            working in foreign countries for United States employers; § 112 responds to Lorance v.
            AT&amp;amp;T Technologies, Inc., 490 U. S. 900 (1989), by expanding employees' rights to
            challenge discriminatory seniority systems; § 113 responds to West Virginia Univ.
            Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83 (1991), by providing that an award of attorney's
            fees may include expert fees; and § 114 responds to Library of Congress v. Shaw, 478 U.
            S. 310 (1986), by allowing interest on judgments against the United States.</p>
         <p>A number of important provisions in the Act, however, were not responses to Supreme
            Court decisions. For example, § 106 enacts a new prohibition against adjusting test
               <span class="star-pagination">*252</span> scores "on the basis of race, color,
            religion, sex, or national origin"; § 117 extends the coverage of Title VII to include
            the House of Representatives and certain employees of the Legislative Branch; and §§
            301-325 establish special procedures to protect Senate employees from discrimination.
            Among the provisions that did not directly respond to any Supreme Court decision is the
            one at issue in this case, § 102.</p>
         <p>Entitled "Damages in Cases of Intentional Discrimination," § 102 provides in relevant
            part:</p>
         <p>"(a) Right of Recovery.&#x97;</p> "(1) Civil Rights.&#x97;In an action brought by a
         complaining party under section 706 or 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U. S. C.
         2000e&#x97;5) against a respondent who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination (not
         an employment practice that is unlawful because of its disparate impact) prohibited under
         section 703, 704, or 717 of the Act (42 U. S. C. 2000e&#x97;2 or 2000e&#x97; 3), and
         provided that the complaining party cannot recover under section 1977 of the Revised
         Statutes (42 U. S. C. 1981), the complaining party may recover compensatory and punitive
         damages . . . in addition to any relief authorized by section 706(g) of the Civil Rights
         Act of 1964, from the respondent. . . . . . "(c) Jury Trial.&#x97;If a complaining party
         seeks compensatory or punitive damages under this section&#x97; <p>"(1) any party may
            demand a trial by jury."</p>
         <p>Before the enactment of the 1991 Act, Title VII afforded only "equitable" remedies. The
            primary form of monetary relief available was backpay.<span class="sup">[4]</span> Title
            VII's backpay remedy,<span class="sup">[5]</span>
            <span class="star-pagination">*253</span> modeled on that of the National Labor
            Relations Act, 29 U. S. C. § 160(c), is a "make-whole" remedy that resembles
            compensatory damages in some respects. See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405,
            418-422 (1975). However, the new compensatory damages provision of the 1991 Act is "in
            addition to," and does not replace or duplicate, the backpay remedy allowed under prior
            law. Indeed, to prevent double recovery, the 1991 Act provides that compensatory damages
            "shall not include backpay, interest on backpay, or any other type of relief authorized
            under section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." § 102(b)(2).</p>
         <p>Section 102 significantly expands the monetary relief potentially available to
            plaintiffs who would have been entitled to backpay under prior law. Before 1991, for
            example, monetary relief for a discriminatorily discharged employee generally included
            "only an amount equal to the wages the employee would have earned from the date of
            discharge to the date of reinstatement, along with lost fringe benefits such as vacation
            pay and pension benefits." United States v. Burke, 504 U. S. 229, 239 (1992). Under §
            102, however, a Title VII plaintiff who wins a backpay award may also seek compensatory
            damages for "future pecuniary losses, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental
            anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other nonpecuniary losses." § 102(b)(3). In
            addition, <span class="star-pagination">*254</span> when it is shown that the employer
            acted "with malice or with reckless indifference to the [plaintiff's] federally
            protected rights," § 102(b)(1), a plaintiff may recover punitive damages.<span
               class="sup">[6]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Section 102 also allows monetary relief for some forms of workplace discrimination that
            would not previously have justified any relief under Title VII. As this case
            illustrates, even if unlawful discrimination was proved, under prior law a Title VII
            plaintiff could not recover monetary relief unless the discrimination was also found to
            have some concrete effect on the plaintiff's employment status, such as a denied
            promotion, a differential in compensation, or termination. See Burke, 504 U. S., at 240.
            ("[T]he circumscribed remedies available under Title VII [before the 1991 Act] stand in
            marked contrast not only to those available under traditional tort law, but under other
            federal anti-discrimination statutes, as well"). Section 102, however, allows a
            plaintiff to recover in circumstances in which there has been unlawful discrimination in
            the "terms, conditions, or privileges of employment," 42 U. S. C. §
               2000e&#x97;2(a)(1),<span class="sup">[7]</span> even though the discrimination did
            not involve a discharge or a loss of pay. In short, to further Title VII's "central
            statutory purposes of eradicating discrimination throughout the economy and making
            persons whole for injuries suffered through past discrimination," Albemarle Paper Co.,
            422 U. S., at 421, § 102 of the <span class="star-pagination">*255</span> 1991 Act
            effects a major expansion in the relief available to victims of employment
            discrimination.</p>
         <p>In 1990, a comprehensive civil rights bill passed both Houses of Congress. Although
            similar to the 1991 Act in many other respects, the 1990 bill differed in that it
            contained language expressly calling for application of many of its provisions,
            including the section providing for damages in cases of intentional employment
            discrimination, to cases arising before its (expected) enactment.<span class="sup"
               >[8]</span> The President vetoed <span class="star-pagination">*256</span> the 1990
            legislation, however, citing the bill's "unfair retroactivity rules" as one reason for
            his disapproval.<span class="sup">[9]</span> Congress narrowly failed to override the
            veto. See 136 Cong. Rec. S16589 (Oct. 24, 1990) (66 to 34 Senate vote in favor of
            override).</p>
         <p>The absence of comparable language in the 1991 Act cannot realistically be attributed to
            oversight or to unawareness of the retroactivity issue. Rather, it seems likely that one
            of the compromises that made it possible to enact the 1991 version was an agreement not
            to include the kind of explicit retroactivity command found in the 1990 bill.</p>
         <p>The omission of the elaborate retroactivity provision of the 1990 bill&#x97;which was by
            no means the only source of political controversy over that legislation&#x97;is not
            dispositive because it does not tell us precisely where the compromise was struck in the
            1991 Act. The Legislature might, for example, have settled in 1991 on a less expansive
            form of retroactivity that, unlike the 1990 bill, did not reach cases already finally
            decided. See n. 8, supra. A decision to reach only cases still pending might explain
            Congress' failure to provide in the <span class="star-pagination">*257</span> 1991 Act,
            as it had in 1990, that certain sections would apply to proceedings pending on specific
            preenactment dates. Our first question, then, is whether the statutory text on which
            petitioner relies manifests an intent that the 1991 Act should be applied to cases that
            arose and went to trial before its enactment.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>Petitioner's textual argument relies on three provisions of the 1991 Act: §§ 402(a),
            402(b), and 109(c). Section 402(a), the only provision of the Act that speaks directly
            to the question before us, states:</p> "Except as otherwise specifically provided, this
         Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take effect upon enactment." <p>That language
            does not, by itself, resolve the question before us. A statement that a statute will
            become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any
            application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.<span class="sup">[10]</span>
            <span class="star-pagination">*258</span> Petitioner does not argue otherwise. Rather,
            she contends that the introductory clause of § 402(a) would be superfluous unless it
            refers to §§ 402(b) and 109(c), which provide for prospective application in limited
            contexts.</p>
         <p>The parties agree that § 402(b) was intended to exempt a single disparate impact lawsuit
            against the Wards Cove Packing Company. Section 402(b) provides:</p> "(b) Certain
         Disparate Impact Cases.óNotwithstanding any other provision of this Act, nothing in this
         Act shall apply to any disparate impact case for which a complaint was filed before March
         1, 1975, and for which an initial decision was rendered after October 30, 1983." <p>Section
            109(c), part of the section extending Title VII to overseas employers, states:</p> "(c)
         Application of Amendments.&#x97;The amendments made by this section shall not apply with
         respect to conduct occurring before the date of the enactment of this Act." <p>According to
            petitioner, these two subsections are the "other provisions" contemplated in the first
            clause of § 402(a), and together create a strong negative inference that all sections of
            the Act not specifically declared prospective apply to pending cases that arose before
            November 21, 1991.</p>
         <p>Before addressing the particulars of petitioner's argument, we observe that she places
            extraordinary weight on two comparatively minor and narrow provisions in a long and
            complex statute. Applying the entire Act to cases arising from preenactment conduct
            would have important consequences, including the possibility that trials completed
            before its enactment <span class="star-pagination">*259</span> would need to be retried
            and the possibility that employers would be liable for punitive damages for conduct
            antedating the Act's enactment. Purely prospective application, on the other hand, would
            prolong the life of a remedial scheme, and of judicial constructions of civil rights
            statutes, that Congress obviously found wanting. Given the high stakes of the
            retroactivity question, the broad coverage of the statute, and the prominent and
            specific retroactivity provisions in the 1990 bill, it would be surprising for Congress
            to have chosen to resolve that question through negative inferences drawn from two
            provisions of quite limited effect.</p>
         <p>Petitioner, however, invokes the canon that a court should give effect to every
            provision of a statute and thus avoid redundancy among different provisions. See, e. g.,
            Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency &amp;amp; Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825, 837, and n.
            11 (1988). Unless the word "otherwise" in § 402(a) refers to either § 402(b) or §
            109(c), she contends, the first five words in § 402(a) are entirely superfluous.
            Moreover, relying on the canon "[e]xpressio unius est exclusio alterius, " see
            Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S.
            163, 168 (1993), petitioner argues that because Congress provided specifically for
            prospectivity in two places (§§ 109(c) and 402(b)), we should infer that it intended the
            opposite for the remainder of the statute.</p>
         <p>Petitioner emphasizes that § 402(a) begins: "Except as otherwise specifically provided."
            A scan of the statute for other "specific provisions" concerning effective dates reveals
            that §§ 402(b) and 109(c) are the most likely candidates. Since those provisions decree
            prospectivity, and since § 402(a) tells us that the specific provisions are exceptions,
            § 402(b) should be considered as prescribing a general rule of retroactivity.
            Petitioner's argument has some force, but we find it most unlikely that Congress
            intended the introductory clause to carry the critically important meaning petitioner
            assigns it. Had Congress wished § 402(a) to have such a determinate <span
               class="star-pagination">*260</span> meaning, it surely would have used language
            comparable to its reference to the predecessor Title VII damages provisions in the 1990
            legislation: that the new provisions "shall apply to all proceedings pending on or
            commenced after the date of enactment of this Act." S. 2104, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. §
            15(a)(4) (1990).</p>
         <p>It is entirely possible that Congress inserted the "otherwise specifically provided"
            language not because it understood the "takes effect" clause to establish a rule of
            retroactivity to which only two "other specific provisions" would be exceptions, but
            instead to assure that any specific timing provisions in the Act would prevail over the
            general "take effect on enactment" command. The drafters of a complicated piece of
            legislation containing more than 50 separate sections may well have inserted the "except
            as otherwise provided" language merely to avoid the risk of an inadvertent conflict in
            the statute.<span class="sup">[11]</span> If the introductory clause of § 402(a) was
            intended to refer specifically to §§ 402(b), 109(c), or both, it is difficult to
            understand why the drafters chose the word "otherwise" rather than either or both of the
            appropriate section numbers.</p>
         <p>We are also unpersuaded by petitioner's argument that both §§ 402(b) and 109(c) merely
            duplicate the "take effect upon enactment" command of § 402(a) unless all other
            provisions, including the damages provisions of § 102, apply to pending cases. That
            argument depends on the assumption that all those other provisions must be treated
            uniformly for purposes of their application to pending cases based on preenactment
            conduct. That thesis, however, is by no <span class="star-pagination">*261</span> means
            an inevitable one. It is entirely possible&#x97;indeed, highly probable&#x97;that,
            because it was unable to resolve the retroactivity issue with the clarity of the 1990
            legislation, Congress viewed the matter as an open issue to be resolved by the courts.
            Our precedents on retroactivity left doubts about what default rule would apply in the
            absence of congressional guidance, and suggested that some provisions might apply to
            cases arising before enactment while others might not.<span class="sup">[12]</span>
            Compare Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204 (1988), with Bradley v. School
            Bd. of Richmond, 416 U. S. 696 (1974). See also Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U. S. 632
            (1985). The only matters Congress did not leave to the courts were set out with
            specificity in §§ 109(c) and 402(b). Congressional doubt concerning judicial
            retroactivity doctrine, coupled with the likelihood that the routine "take effect upon
            enactment" language would require courts to fall back upon that doctrine, provide a
            plausible explanation for both §§ 402(b) and 109(c) that makes neither provision
            redundant.</p>
         <p>Turning to the text of § 402(b), it seems unlikely that the introductory phrase
            ("Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act") was meant to refer to the
            immediately preceding subsection. Since petitioner does not contend that any other
            provision speaks to the general effective date issue, the logic of her argument requires
            us to interpret that phrase to mean nothing more than "Notwithstanding § 402(a)."
            Petitioner's textual argument assumes that the drafters selected the indefinite word
            "otherwise" in § 402(a) to identify two <span class="star-pagination">*262</span>
            specific subsections and the even more indefinite term "any other provision" in § 402(b)
            to refer to nothing more than § 402(b)'s next-door neighbor&#x97;§ 402(a). Here again,
            petitioner's statutory argument would require us to assume that Congress chose a
            surprisingly indirect route to convey an important and easily expressed message
            concerning the Act's effect on pending cases.</p>
         <p>The relevant legislative history of the 1991 Act reinforces our conclusion that §§
            402(a), 109(c), and 402(b) cannot bear the weight petitioner places upon them. The 1991
            bill as originally introduced in the House contained explicit retroactivity provisions
            similar to those found in the 1990 bill.<span class="sup">[13]</span> However, the
            Senate substitute that was agreed upon omitted those explicit retroactivity
               provisions.<span class="sup">[14]</span> The legislative history discloses some
            frankly partisan statements about the meaning of the final effective date language, but
            those statements cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any general agreement.<span
               class="sup">[15]</span> The history reveals no evidence that Members <span
               class="star-pagination">*263</span> believed that an agreement had been tacitly
            struck on the controversial retroactivity issue, and little to suggest that Congress
            understood or intended the interplay of §§ 402(a), 402(b), and 109(c) to have the
            decisive effect petitioner assigns them. Instead, the history of the 1991 Act conveys
            the impression that legislators agreed to disagree about whether and to what extent the
            Act would apply to preenactment conduct.</p>
         <p>Although the passage of the 1990 bill may indicate that a majority of the 1991 Congress
            also favored retroactive application, even the will of the majority does not become law
            unless it follows the path charted in Article I, § 7, cl. 2, of the Constitution. See
            INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 946-951 (1983). In the absence of the kind of unambiguous
            directive found in § 15 of the 1990 bill, we must look elsewhere for guidance on whether
            § 102 applies to this case.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>IV</h2>
         <p>It is not uncommon to find "apparent tension" between different canons of statutory
            construction. As Professor Llewellyn famously illustrated, many of the traditional
            canons have equal opposites.<span class="sup">[16]</span> In order to resolve the
            question left open by the 1991 Act, federal courts have labored to <span
               class="star-pagination">*264</span> reconcile two seemingly contradictory statements
            found in our decisions concerning the effect of intervening changes in the law. Each
            statement is framed as a generally applicable rule for interpreting statutes that do not
            specify their temporal reach. The first is the rule that "a court is to apply the law in
            effect at the time it renders its decision," Bradley, 416 U. S., at 711. The second is
            the axiom that "[r]etroactivity is not favored in the law," and its interpretive
            corollary that "congressional enactments and administrative rules will not be construed
            to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result." Bowen, 488 U.
            S., at 208.</p>
         <p>We have previously noted the "apparent tension" between those expressions. See Kaiser
            Aluminum &amp;amp; Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U. S. 827, 837 (1990); see also
            Bennett, 470 U. S., at 639-640. We found it unnecessary in Kaiser to resolve that
            seeming conflict "because under either view, where the congressional intent is clear, it
            governs," and the prejudgment interest statute at issue in that case evinced "clear
            congressional intent" that it was "not applicable to judgments entered before its
            effective date." 499 U. S., at 837-838. In the case before us today, however, we have
            concluded that the 1991 Act does not evince any clear expression of intent on § 102's
            application to cases arising before the Act's enactment. We must, therefore, focus on
            the apparent tension between the rules we have espoused for handling similar problems in
            the absence of an instruction from Congress.</p>
         <p>We begin by noting that there is no tension between the holdings in Bradley and Bowen,
            both of which were unanimous decisions. Relying on another unanimous decision&#x97;
            Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, 393 U. S. 268 (1969)&#x97;we held in Bradley that
            a statute authorizing the award of attorney's fees to successful civil rights plaintiffs
            applied in a case that was pending on appeal at the time the statute was enacted. Bowen
            held that the Department of Health and Human Services lacked statutory authority to
               <span class="star-pagination">*265</span> promulgate a rule requiring private
            hospitals to refund Medicare payments for services rendered before promulgation of the
            rule. Our opinion in Bowen did not purport to overrule Bradley or to limit its reach. In
            this light, we turn to the "apparent tension" between the two canons mindful of another
            canon of unquestionable vitality, the "maxim not to be disregarded that general
            expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which
            those expressions are used." Cohens v. Virginia, <span class="citation">

         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>As Justice Scalia has demonstrated, the presumption against retroactive legislation is
            deeply rooted in our jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than
            our Republic.<span class="sup">[17]</span> Elementary considerations of fairness dictate
            that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their
            conduct accordingly; settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted.<span
               class="sup">[18]</span> For that reason, the "principle that the legal effect of
            conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took
            place has timeless and universal appeal." Kaiser, 494 U. S., at 855 (Scalia, J.,
            concurring). In <span class="star-pagination">*266</span> a free, dynamic society,
            creativity in both commercial and artistic endeavors is fostered by a rule of law that
            gives people confidence about the legal consequences of their actions.</p>
         <p>It is therefore not surprising that the antiretroactivity principle finds expression in
            several provisions of our Constitution. The Ex Post Facto Clause flatly prohibits
            retroactive application of penal legislation.<span class="sup">[19]</span> Article I, §
            10, cl. 1, prohibits States from passing another type of retroactive legislation, laws
            "impairing the Obligation of Contracts." The Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause prevents
            the Legislature (and other government actors) from depriving private persons of vested
            property rights except for a "public use" and upon payment of "just compensation." The
            prohibitions on "Bills of Attainder" in Art. I, §§ 9-10, prohibit legislatures from
            singling out disfavored persons and meting out summary punishment for past conduct. See,
            e. g., United States v. Brown, 381 U. S. 437, 456-462 (1965). The Due Process Clause
            also protects the interests in fair notice and repose that may be compromised by
            retroactive legislation; a justification sufficient to validate a statute's prospective
            application under the Clause "may not suffice" to warrant its retroactive application.
            Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U. S. 1, 17 (1976).</p>
         <p>These provisions demonstrate that retroactive statutes raise particular concerns. The
            Legislature's unmatched powers allow it to sweep away settled expectations suddenly and
            without individualized consideration. Its responsivity to political pressures poses a
            risk that it may be tempted to use retroactive legislation as a means of retribution
            against unpopular groups or individuals. As Justice Marshall observed in his opinion for
            the Court in Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24 (1981), the Ex Post Facto Clause not only
            ensures <span class="star-pagination">*267</span> that individuals have "fair warning"
            about the effect of criminal statutes, but also "restricts governmental power by
            restraining arbitrary and potentially vindictive legislation." Id., at 28-29 (citations
               omitted).<span class="sup">[20]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The Constitution's restrictions, of course, are of limited scope. Absent a violation of
            one of those specific provisions, the potential unfairness of retroactive civil
            legislation is not a sufficient reason for a court to fail to give a statute its
            intended scope.<span class="sup">[21]</span> Retroactivity provisions often serve
            entirely <span class="star-pagination">*268</span> benign and legitimate purposes,
            whether to respond to emergencies, to correct mistakes, to prevent circumvention of a
            new statute in the interval immediately preceding its passage, or simply to give
            comprehensive effect to a new law Congress considers salutary. However, a requirement
            that Congress first make its intention clear helps ensure that Congress itself has
            determined that the benefits of retroactivity outweigh the potential for disruption or
            unfairness.</p>
         <p>While statutory retroactivity has long been disfavored, deciding when a statute operates
            "retroactively" is not always a simple or mechanical task. Sitting on Circuit, Justice
            Story offered an influential definition in Society for Propagation of the Gospel v.
            Wheeler, <span class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">22</span>
               <span class="reporter">F. Cas.</span>
               <span class="page">756</span>
            </span> (No. 13,156) (CC NH 1814), a case construing a provision of the New Hampshire
            Constitution that broadly prohibits "retrospective" laws both criminal and civil.<span
               class="sup">[22]</span> Justice Story first rejected the notion that the provision
            bars only explicitly retroactive legislation, i. e., "statutes . . . enacted to take
            effect from a time anterior to their passage." Id., at 767. Such a construction, he
            concluded, would be "utterly subversive of all the objects" of the prohibition. Ibid.
            Instead, the ban on retrospective legislation embraced "all statutes, which, though
            operating only from their passage, affect vested <span class="star-pagination"
               >*269</span> rights and past transactions." Ibid. "Upon principle," Justice Story
            elaborated,</p> "every statute, which takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under
         existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new
         disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past, must be deemed
         retrospective . . . ." Ibid. (citing Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386 (1798), and Dash v. Van
         Kleeck, 7 Johns. *477 (N. Y. 1811)). <p>Though the formulas have varied, similar functional
            conceptions of legislative "retroactivity" have found voice in this Court's decisions
            and elsewhere.<span class="sup">[23]</span>
         </p>
         <p>A statute does not operate "retrospectively" merely because it is applied in a case
            arising from conduct antedating the statute's enactment, see Republic Nat. Bank of Miami
            v. United States, 506 U. S. 80, 100 (1992) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and
            concurring in judgment), or upsets expectations based in prior law.<span class="sup"
               >[24]</span> Rather, the court must ask <span class="star-pagination">*270</span>
            whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its
            enactment. The conclusion that a particular rule operates "retroactively" comes at the
            end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law
            and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past
            event. Any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is
            unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical
            clarity. However, retroactivity is a matter on which judges tend to have "sound . . .
            instinct[s]," see Danforth v. Groton Water Co., <span class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">178</span>
               <span class="reporter">Mass.</span>

            </span>, 476, 59 N. E. 1033, 1034 (1901) (Holmes, J.), and familiar considerations of
            fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.</p>
         <p>Since the early days of this Court, we have declined to give retroactive effect to
            statutes burdening private rights unless Congress had made clear its intent. Thus, in
            United States v. Heth, 3 Cranch 399 (1806), we refused to apply a federal statute
            reducing the commissions of customs collectors to collections commenced before the
            statute's enactment because the statute lacked "clear, strong, and imperative" language
            requiring retroactive application, id., at 413 (opinion of Paterson, J.). The
            presumption against statutory retroactivity has consistently been explained by reference
            to the unfairness of imposing new burdens on persons after the fact. Indeed, at common
            law a contrary rule applied to statutes that merely removed a burden on private rights
            by repealing a penal provision (whether criminal or civil); such <span
               class="star-pagination">*271</span> repeals were understood to preclude punishment
            for acts antedating the repeal. See, e. g. ,United States v. Chambers, 291 U. S. 217,

         <p>The largest category of cases in which we have applied the presumption against statutory
            retroactivity has involved new provisions affecting contractual or property rights,
            matters in which predictability and stability are of prime importance.<span class="sup"
               >[25]</span> The presumption has not, however, been limited to such cases. At issue
            in Chew Heong v. United States, 112 U. S. 536 (1884), for example, was a provision of
            the "Chinese Restriction Act" of 1882 barring Chinese laborers from reentering the
            United States without a certificate prepared when they exited this country. We held that
            the statute did not bar the reentry of a laborer who had left the United States before
            the certification requirement was promulgated. Justice Harlan's opinion for the Court
            observed that the law in effect before the 1882 enactment had accorded laborers a right
            to reenter without a certificate, and invoked the "uniformly" accepted rule against
            "giv[ing] to statutes a retrospective <span class="star-pagination">*272</span>
            operation, whereby rights previously vested are injuriously affected, unless compelled
            to do so by language so clear and positive as to leave no room to doubt that such was
            the intention of the legislature." Id., at 559.</p>
         <p>Our statement in Bowen that "congressional enactments and administrative rules will not
            be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result," 488
            U. S., at 208, was in step with this long line of cases.<span class="sup"
            >[26]</span>Bowen itself was a paradigmatic case of retroactivity in which a federal
            agency sought to recoup, under cost limit regulations issued in 1984, funds that had
            been paid to hospitals for services rendered earlier, see id., at 207; our search for
            clear congressional intent authorizing retroactivity was consistent with the approach
            taken in decisions spanning two centuries.</p>
         <p>The presumption against statutory retroactivity had special force in the era in which
            courts tended to view legislative interference with property and contract rights
            circumspectly. In this century, legislation has come to supply the dominant means of
            legal ordering, and circumspection has given way to greater deference to legislative
            judgments. See Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U. S., at 15-16; Home Building
            &amp;amp; Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398, 436-444 (1934). But while the
            constitutional impediments to retroactive civil legislation are now modest,
            prospectivity remains the appropriate default rule. Because it accords with widely held
            intuitions about how statutes ordinarily operate, a presumption against retroactivity
            will generally coincide with legislative and public expectations. Requiring clear intent
            assures that Congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of
            retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price <span
               class="star-pagination">*273</span> to pay for the countervailing benefits. Such a
            requirement allocates to Congress responsibility for fundamental policy judgments
            concerning the proper temporal reach of statutes, and has the additional virtue of
            giving legislators a predictable background rule against which to legislate.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B</h2>
         <p>Although we have long embraced a presumption against statutory retroactivity, for just
            as long we have recognized that, in many situations, a court should "apply the law in
            effect at the time it renders its decision," Bradley, 416 U. S., at 711, even though
            that law was enacted after the events that gave rise to the suit. There is, of course,
            no conflict between that principle and a presumption against retroactivity when the
            statute in question is unambiguous. Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in United States v.
            Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103 (1801), illustrates this point. Because a treaty signed on
            September 30, 1800, while the case was pending on appeal, unambiguously provided for the
            restoration of captured property "not yet definitively condemned," id., at 107 (emphasis
            in original), we reversed a decree entered on September 23, 1800, condemning a French
            vessel that had been seized in American waters. Our application of "the law in effect"
            at the time of our decision in Schooner Peggy was simply a response to the language of
            the statute. Id., at 109.</p>
         <p>Even absent specific legislative authorization, application of new statutes passed after
            the events in suit is unquestionably proper in many situations. When the intervening
            statute authorizes or affects the propriety of prospective relief, application of the
            new provision is not retroactive. Thus, in American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central
            Trades Council, 257 U. S. 184 (1921), we held that § 20 of the Clayton Act, enacted
            while the case was pending on appeal, governed the propriety of injunctive relief
            against labor picketing. In remanding the suit for application of the intervening
            statute, <span class="star-pagination">*274</span> we observed that "relief by
            injunction operates in futuro, " and that the plaintiff had no "vested right" in the
            decree entered by the trial court. 257 U. S., at 201. See also, e. g., Hall v. Beals,
            396 U. S. 45, 48 (1969); Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U. S. 443, 464
            (1921).</p>
         <p>We have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction,
            whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit
            was filed. Thus, in Bruner v. United States, 343 U. S. 112, 116-117 (1952), relying on
            our "consisten[t]" practice, we ordered an action dismissed because the jurisdictional
            statute under which it had been (properly) filed was subsequently repealed.<span

            604, 607-608, n. 6 (1978), we held that, because a statute passed while the case was
            pending on appeal had eliminated the amount-in-controversy requirement for
            federal-question cases, the fact that respondent had failed to allege $10,000 in
            controversy at the commencement of the action was "now of no moment." See also United
            States v. Alabama, 362 U. S. 602, 604 (1960) (per curiam); Stephens v. Cherokee Nation,
            174 U. S. 445, 478 (1899). Application of a new jurisdictional rule usually "takes away
            no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case."
            Hallowell, 239 U. S., at 508. Present law normally governs in such situations because
            jurisdictional statutes "speak to the power of the court rather than to the rights or
            obligations of the parties," Republic Nat. Bank of Miami , 506 U. S., at 100 (Thomas,
            J., concurring).</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*275</span> Changes in procedural rules may often be
            applied in suits arising before their enactment without raising concerns about
            retroactivity. For example, in Ex parte Collett, 337 U. S. 55, 71 (1949), we held that
            28 U. S. C. § 1404(a) governed the transfer of an action instituted prior to that
            statute's enactment. We noted the diminished reliance interests in matters of procedure.
            337 U. S., at 71.<span class="sup">[28]</span> Because rules of procedure regulate
            secondary rather than primary conduct, the fact that a new procedural rule was
            instituted after the conduct giving rise to the suit does not make application of the
            rule at trial retroactive. Cf. McBurney v. Carson, 99 U. S. 567, 569 (1879).<span
               class="sup">[29]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*276</span> Petitioner relies principally upon Bradley v.
            School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U. S. 696 (1974), and Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham,
            393 U. S. 268 (1969), in support of her argument that our ordinary interpretive rules
            support application of § 102 to her case. In Thorpe , we held that an agency circular
            requiring a local housing authority to give notice of reasons and opportunity to respond
            before evicting a tenant was applicable to an eviction proceeding commenced before the
            regulation issued. Thorpe shares much with both the "procedural" and
            "prospective-relief" cases. See supra, at 273-275. Thus, we noted in Thorpe that new
            hearing procedures did not affect either party's obligations under the lease agreement
            between the housing authority and the petitioner, 393 U. S., at 279, and, because the
            tenant had "not yet vacated," we saw no significance in the fact that the housing
            authority had "decided to evict her before the circular was issued," id., at 283. The
            Court in Thorpe viewed the new eviction procedures as "essential to remove a serious
            impediment to the successful protection of constitutional rights." Ibid.<span
               class="sup">[30]</span> Cf. Youakim v. Miller, 425 U. S. 231, 237 (1976) (per curiam)
            (citing Thorpe for propriety of applying new law to avoiding necessity of deciding
            constitutionality of old one).</p>
         <p>Our holding in Bradley is similarly compatible with the line of decisions disfavoring
            "retroactive" application of statutes. In Bradley, the District Court had awarded
            attorney's fees and costs, upon general equitable principles, to parents who had
            prevailed in an action seeking to desegregate the public schools of Richmond, Virginia.
            While the <span class="star-pagination">*277</span> case was pending before the Court of
            Appeals, Congress enacted § 718 of the Education Amendments of 1972, which authorized
            federal courts to award the prevailing parties in school desegregation cases a
            reasonable attorney's fee. The Court of Appeals held that the new fee provision did not
            authorize the award of fees for services rendered before the effective date of the
            amendments. This Court reversed. We concluded that the private parties could rely on §
            718 to support their claim for attorney's fees, resting our decision "on the principle
            that a court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, unless
            doing so would result in manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or
            legislative history to the contrary." 416 U. S., at 711.</p>
         <p>Although that language suggests a categorical presumption in favor of application of all
            new rules of law, we now make it clear that Bradley did not alter the well-settled
            presumption against application of the class of new statutes that would have genuinely
            "retroactive" effect. Like the new hearing requirement in Thorpe, the attorney's fee
            provision at issue in Bradley did not resemble the cases in which we have invoked the
            presumption against statutory retroactivity. Attorney's fee determinations, we have
            observed, are "collateral to the main cause of action" and "uniquely separable from the
            cause of action to be proved at trial." White v. New Hampshire Dept. of Employment
            Security, 455 U. S. 445, 451-452 (1982). See also Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678, 695,
            n. 24 (1978). Moreover, even before the enactment of § 718, federal courts had authority
            (which the District Court in Bradley had exercised) to award fees based upon equitable
            principles. As our opinion in Bradley made clear, it would be difficult to imagine a
            stronger equitable case for an attorney's fee award than a lawsuit in which the
            plaintiff parents would otherwise have to bear the costs of desegregating their
            children's public schools. See 416 U. S., at 718 (noting that the plaintiffs had brought
            the school board "into compliance with its constitutional mandate") (citing Brown v.
            Board <span class="star-pagination">*278</span> of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 494
            (1954)). In light of the prior availability of a fee award, and the likelihood that fees
            would be assessed under pre-existing theories, we concluded that the new fee statute
            simply "d[id] not impose an additional or unforeseeable obligation" upon the school
            board. Bradley, 416 U. S., at 721.</p>
         <p>In approving application of the new fee provision, Bradley did not take issue with the
            long line of decisions applying the presumption against retroactivity. Our opinion
            distinguished, but did not criticize, prior cases that had applied the antiretroactivity
            canon. See id. , at 720 (citing Greene v. United States, 376 U. S. 149, 160 (1964);
            Claridge Apartments Co. v. Commissioner, 323 U. S. 141, 164 (1944), and Union Pacific R.
            Co. v. Laramie Stock Yards Co., 231 U. S. 190, 199 (1913)). The authorities we relied
            upon in Bradley lend further support to the conclusion that we did not intend to
            displace the traditional presumption against applying statutes affecting substantive
            rights, liabilities, or duties to conduct arising before their enactment. See Kaiser,
            494 U. S., at 849-850 (Scalia, J., concurring). Bradley relied on Thorpe and on other
            precedents that are consistent with a presumption against statutory retroactivity,
            including decisions involving explicitly retroactive statutes, see 416 U. S., at 713, n.
            17 (citing, inter alia, Freeborn v. Smith, <span class="citation">

            judicial decisions, see 416 U. S., at 713-714, n. 17 (citing, inter alia, 17
               (1935)),<span class="sup">[32]</span> statutes Patterson v. Alabama, 294 U. S. 600,

            U. S. 217 (1934)). Moreover, in none of our decisions that have relied upon Bradley or
            Thorpe have we cast doubt on the traditional presumption against truly "retrospective"
            application of a statute.<span class="sup">[33]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*280</span> When a case implicates a federal statute
            enacted after the events in suit, the court's first task is to determine whether
            Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's proper reach. If Congress has done so,
            of course, there is no need to resort to judicial default rules. When, however, the
            statute contains no such express command, the court must determine whether the new
            statute would have retroactive effect, i. e., whether it would impair rights a party
            possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new
            duties with respect to transactions already completed. If the statute would operate
            retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear
            congressional intent favoring such a result.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>V</h2>
         <p>We now ask whether, given the absence of guiding instructions from Congress, § 102 of
            the Civil Rights Act of 1991 is the type of provision that should govern cases arising
            before its enactment. As we observed supra, at 260-261, and n. 12, there is no special
            reason to think that all the diverse provisions of the Act must be treated uniformly for
            such purposes. To the contrary, we understand the instruction that the provisions are to
            "take effect upon enactment" to mean that courts should evaluate each provision of the
            Act in light of ordinary judicial principles concerning the application of new rules to
            pending cases and preenactment conduct.</p>
         <p>Two provisions of § 102 may be readily classified according to these principles. The
            jury trial right set out in § 102(c)(1) is plainly a procedural change of the sort that
            would ordinarily govern in trials conducted after its effective date. If § 102 did no
            more than introduce a right to jury trial in Title <span class="star-pagination"
               >*281</span> VII cases, the provision would presumably apply to cases tried after
            November 21, 1991, regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred.<span class="sup"
               >[34]</span> However, because § 102(c) makes a jury trial available only "[i]f a
            complaining party seeks compensatory or punitive damages," the jury trial option must
            stand or fall with the attached damages provisions.</p>
         <p>Section 102(b)(1) is clearly on the other side of the line. That subsection authorizes
            punitive damages if the plaintiff shows that the defendant "engaged in a discriminatory
            practice or discriminatory practices with malice or with reckless indifference to the
            federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual." The very labels given "punitive"
            or "exemplary" damages, as well as the rationales that support them, demonstrate that
            they share key characteristics of criminal sanctions. Retroactive imposition of punitive
            damages would raise a serious constitutional question. See Turner Elkhorn, 428 U. S., at
            17 (Court would "hesitate to approve the retrospective imposition of liability on any
            theory of deterrence . . . or blameworthiness"); De Veau v. Braisted, 363 U. S. 144, 160
            (1960) ("The mark of an ex post facto law is the imposition of what can fairly be
            designated punishment for past acts"). See also Louis Vuitton S. A. v. Spencer Handbags
            Corp., 765 F. 2d 966, 972 (CA2 1985) (retroactive application of punitive treble damages
            provisions of Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984 "would present a potential ex post
            facto problem"). Before we entertained that question, we would have to be confronted
            with a statute that explicitly authorized punitive damages for preenactment conduct. The
            Civil Rights Act of 1991 contains no such explicit command.</p>
         <p>The provision of § 102(a)(1) authorizing the recovery of compensatory damages is not
            easily classified. It does not <span class="star-pagination">*282</span> make unlawful
            conduct that was lawful when it occurred; as we have noted, supra, at 252-255, § 102
            only reaches discriminatory conduct already prohibited by Title VII. Concerns about a
            lack of fair notice are further muted by the fact that such discrimination was in many
            cases (although not this one) already subject to monetary liability in the form of
            backpay. Nor could anyone seriously contend that the compensatory damages provisions
            smack of a "retributive" or other suspect legislative purpose. Section 102 reflects
            Congress' desire to afford victims of discrimination more complete redress for
            violations of rules established more than a generation ago in the Civil Rights Act of
            1964. At least with respect to its compensatory damages provisions, then, § 102 is not
            in a category in which objections to retroactive application on grounds of fairness have
            their greatest force.</p>
         <p>Nonetheless, the new compensatory damages provision would operate "retrospectively" if
            it were applied to conduct occurring before November 21, 1991. Unlike certain other
            forms of relief, compensatory damages are quintessentially backward looking.
            Compensatory damages may be intended less to sanction wrongdoers than to make victims
            whole, but they do so by a mechanism that affects the liabilities of defendants. They do
            not "compensate" by distributing funds from the public coffers, but by requiring
            particular employers to pay for harms they caused. The introduction of a right to
            compensatory damages is also the type of legal change that would have an impact on
            private parties' planning.<span class="sup">[35]</span> In this case, the event to which
            the new damages <span class="star-pagination">*283</span> provision relates is the
            discriminatory conduct of respondents' agent John Williams; if applied here, that
            provision would attach an important new legal burden to that conduct. The new damages
            remedy in § 102, we conclude, is the kind of provision that does not apply to events
            antedating its enactment in the absence of clear congressional intent.</p>
         <p>In cases like this one, in which prior law afforded no relief, § 102 can be seen as
            creating a new cause of action, and its impact on parties' rights is especially
            pronounced. Section 102 confers a new right to monetary relief on persons like
            petitioner who were victims of a hostile work environment but were not constructively
            discharged, and the novel prospect of damages liability for their employers. Because
            Title VII previously authorized recovery of backpay in some cases, and because
            compensatory damages under § 102(a) are in addition to any backpay recoverable, the new
            provision also resembles a statute increasing the amount of damages available under a
            preestablished cause of action. Even under that view, however, the provision would, if
            applied in cases arising before the Act's effective date, undoubtedly impose on
            employers found liable a "new disability" in respect to past events. See Society for
            Propagation of the Gospel, 22 F. Cas., at 767. The extent of a party's liability, in the

               class="sup">[36]</span> Neither in Bradley itself, nor in any case before or since in
            which Congress had not clearly spoken, have we read a statute substantially increasing

            statute's enactment. See Winfree v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 227 U. S. 296, 301 (1913)

         </p>
         <p>It will frequently be true, as petitioner and amici forcefully argue here, that
            retroactive application of a new statute would vindicate its purpose more fully.<span
               class="sup">[38]</span> That consideration, <span class="star-pagination">*286</span>
            however, is not sufficient to rebut the presumption against retroactivity. Statutes are
            seldom crafted to pursue a single goal, and compromises necessary to their enactment may
            require adopting means other than those that would most effectively pursue the main
            goal. A legislator who supported a prospective statute might reasonably oppose
            retroactive application of the same statute. Indeed, there is reason to believe that the
            omission of the 1990 version's express retroactivity provisions was a factor in the
            passage of the 1991 bill. Section 102 is plainly not the sort of provision that must be
            understood to operate retroactively because a contrary reading would render it
            ineffective.</p>
         <p>The presumption against statutory retroactivity is founded upon sound considerations of
            general policy and practice, and accords with long held and widely shared expectations
            about the usual operation of legislation. We are satisfied that it applies to § 102.
            Because we have found no clear evidence of congressional intent that § 102 of the Civil
            Rights Act of 1991 should apply to cases arising before its enactment, we conclude that
            the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be affirmed.</p> It is so ordered. Justice

            judgments.<span class="sup">[*]</span>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>I of course agree with the Court that there exists a judicial presumption, of great
            antiquity, that a legislative enactment affecting substantive rights does not apply
            retroactively absent clear statement to the contrary. See generally Kaiser <span
               class="star-pagination">*287</span> Aluminum &amp;amp; Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno,
            494 U. S. 827, 840 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring). The Court, however, is willing to
            let that clear statement be supplied, not by the text of the law in question, but by
            individual legislators who participated in the enactment of the law, and even
            legislators in an earlier Congress which tried and failed to enact a similar law. For
            the Court not only combs the floor debate and Committee Reports of the statute at issue,
            the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act), Pub. L. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071, see ante, at
            262-263, but also reviews the procedural history of an earlier, unsuccessful, attempt by
            a different Congress to enact similar legislation, the Civil Rights Act of 1990, S.
            2104, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. (1990), see ante, at 255-257, 263.</p>
         <p>This effectively converts the "clear statement" rule into a "discernible legislative
            intent" rule&#x97;and even that understates the difference. The Court's rejection of the
            floor statements of certain Senators because they are "frankly partisan" and "cannot
            plausibly be read as reflecting any general agreement," ante, at 262, reads like any
            other exercise in the soft science of legislative historicizing,<span class="sup"
               >[1]</span> undisciplined by any distinctive "clear statement" requirement. If it is
            a "clear statement" we are seeking, surely it is not enough to insist that the statement
            can "plausibly be read as reflecting general agreement"; the statement must clearly
            reflect general agreement. No legislative history can do that, of course, but only the
            text of the statute itself. That has been the meaning of the "clear statement"
            retroactivity rule from the earliest times. See, e. g., United States v. Heth, 3 Cranch
            399, 408 (1806) (Johnson, J.) ("Unless, therefore, the words are too imperious to admit
            of a different construction, [the Court should] restric[t] the words of the law to a
            future <span class="star-pagination">*288</span> operation"); id. , at 414 (Cushing,
            J.)("[I]t [is] unreasonable, in my opinion, to give the law a construction, which would

            (collecting cases applying the clear statement test). I do not deem that clear rule to
            be changed by the Court's dicta regarding legislative history in the present case.</p>
         <p>The 1991 Act does not expressly state that it operates retroactively, but petitioner
            contends that its specification of prospective-only application for two sections, §§
            109(c) and 402(b), implies that its other provisions are retroactive. More precisely,
            petitioner argues that since § 402(a) states that "[e]xcept as otherwise specifically
            provided, [the 1991 Act] shall take effect upon enactment"; and since §§ 109(c) and
            402(b) specifically provide that those sections shall operate only prospectively; the
            term "shall take effect upon enactment" in § 402(a) must mean retroactive effect. The
            short response to this refined and subtle argument is that refinement and subtlety are
            no substitute for clear statement. "[S]hall take effect upon enactment" is presumed to
            mean "shall have prospective effect upon enactment," and that presumption is too strong
            to be overcome by any negative inference derived from §§ 109(c) and 402(b).<span

            <span class="star-pagination">*289</span> II</h2>
         <p>The Court's opinion begins with an evaluation of petitioner's argument that the text of
            the statute dictates its retroactive application. The Court's rejection of that argument
            cannot be as forceful as it ought, so long as it insists upon compromising the clarity
            of the ancient and constant assumption that legislation is prospective, by attributing a
            comparable pedigree to the nouveau Bradley presumption in favor of applying the law in
            effect at the time of decision. See Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U. S. 696,
            711-716 (1974). As I have demonstrated elsewhere and need not repeat here, Bradley and
            Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, 393 U. S. 268 (1969), simply misread our
            precedents and invented an utterly new and erroneous rule. See generally Bonjorno,
            supra, at 840 (Scalia, J., concurring).</p>
         <p>Besides embellishing the pedigree of the Bradley -Thorpe presumption, the Court goes out
            of its way to reaffirm the holdings of those cases. I see nothing to be gained by
            overruling them, but neither do I think the indefensible should needlessly be defended.
            And Thorpe, at least, is really indefensible. The regulation at issue there required
            that "before instituting an eviction proceeding local housing authorities . . . should
            inform the tenant . . . of the reasons for the eviction . . . ." Thorpe, supra, at 272,
            and n. 8 (emphasis added). The Court imposed that requirement on an eviction proceeding
            instituted 18 months before the regulation is- sued. That application was plainly
            retroactive and was wrong. The result in Bradley presents a closer question; application
            of an attorney's fees provision to ongoing litigation is arguably not retroactive. If it
            were retroactive, however, it would surely not be saved (as the Court suggests) by the
            existence of another theory under which attorney's fees might have been discretionarily
            awarded, see ante, at 277-278.</p>

         <h2>
            <span class="star-pagination">*290</span> III</h2>
         <p>My last, and most significant, disagreement with the Court's analysis of this case
            pertains to the meaning of retroactivity. The Court adopts as its own the definition
            crafted by Justice Story in a case involving a provision of the New Hampshire
            Constitution that prohibited "retrospective" laws: a law is retroactive only if it
            "takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new
            obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability, in respect to transactions
            or considerations already past." Society for Propagation of the Gospel v. Wheeler, <span
               class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">22</span>

            </span>, 767 (No. 13,156) (CC NH 1814) (Story, J.).</p>
         <p>One might expect from this "vested rights" focus that the Court would hold all changes
            in rules of procedure (as opposed to matters of substance) to apply retroactively. And
            one would draw the same conclusion from the Court's formulation of the test as being
            "whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before
            its enactment"&#x97;a test borrowed directly from our Ex Post Facto Clause
            jurisprudence, see, e. g., Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S. 423, 430 (1987), where we have
            adopted a substantiveprocedural line, see id., at 433 ("[N]o ex post facto violation
            occurs if the change in the law is merely procedural"). In fact, however, the Court
            shrinks from faithfully applying the test that it has announced. It first seemingly
            defends the procedural-substantive distinction that a "vested rights" theory entails,
            ante, at 275 ("Because rules of procedure regulate secondary rather than primary
            conduct, the fact that a new procedural rule was instituted after the conduct giving
            rise to the suit does not make application of the rule at trial retroactive"). But it
            soon acknowledges a broad and illdefined (indeed, utterly undefined) exception: "[T]he
            mere fact that a new rule is procedural does not mean that it applies to every pending
            case." Ante, at 275, n. 29. Under this exception, "a new rule concerning the filing of
            complaints would not govern an action in which the complaint <span
               class="star-pagination">*291</span> had already been properly filed," ibid., and "the
            promulgation of a new jury trial rule would ordinarily not warrant retrial of cases that
            had previously been tried to a judge," ante, at 281, n. 34. It is hard to see how either
            of these refusals to allow retroactive application preserves any "vested right." "`No
            one has a vested right in any given mode of procedure.' " Ex parte Collett, 337 U. S.
            55, 71 (1949), quoting Crane v. Hahlo, 258 U. S. 142, 147 (1922).</p>
         <p>The seemingly random exceptions to the Court's "vested rights" (substance-vs.
            -procedure) criterion must be made, I suggest, because that criterion is fundamentally
            wrong. It may well be that the upsetting of "vested substantive rights" was the proper
            touchstone for interpretation of New Hampshire's constitutional prohibition, as it is
            for interpretation of the United States Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clauses, see ante,
            at 275, n. 28. But Idoubt that it has anything to do with the more mundane question
            before us here: absent clear statement to the contrary, what is the presumed temporal
            application of a statute? For purposes of that question, a procedural change should no
            more be presumed to be retroactive than a substantive one. The critical issue, I think,
            is not whether the rule affects "vested rights," or governs substance or procedure, but
            rather what is the relevant activity that the rule regulates. Absent clear statement
            otherwise, only such relevant activity which occurs after the effective date of the
            statute is covered. Most statutes are meant to regulate primary conduct, and hence will
            not be applied in trials involving conduct that occurred before their effective date.
            But other statutes have a different purpose and therefore a different relevant
            retroactivity event. A new rule of evidence governing expert testimony, for example, is
            aimed at regulating the conduct of trial, and the event relevant to retroactivity of the
            rule is introduction of the testimony. Even though it is a procedural rule, it would
            unquestionably not be applied to testimony already taken &#x97; reversing a case on
            appeal, for example, because the new <span class="star-pagination">*292</span> rule had
            not been applied at a trial which antedated the statute.</p>
         <p>The inadequacy of the Court's "vested rights" approach becomes apparent when a change in
            one of the incidents of trial alters substantive entitlements. The opinion classifies
            attorney's fees provisions as procedural and permits "retroactive" application (in the
            sense of application to cases involving preenactment conduct). See ante, at 277-278. It
            seems to me, however, that holding a person liable for attorney's fees affects a
            "substantive right" no less than holding him liable for compensatory or punitive
            damages, which the Court treats as affecting a vested right. If attorney's fees can be
            awarded in a suit involving conduct that antedated the fee-authorizing statute, it is
            because the purpose of the fee award is not to affect that conduct, but to encourage
            suit for the vindication of certain rights&#x97;so that the retroactivity event is the
            filing of suit, whereafter encouragement is no longer needed. Or perhaps because the
            purpose of the fee award is to facilitate suit&#x97;so that the retroactivity event is
            the termination of suit, whereafter facilitation can no longer be achieved.</p>
         <p>The "vested rights" test does not square with our consistent practice of giving
            immediate effect to statutes that alter a court's jurisdiction. See, e. g., Bruner v.
            United States, 343 U. S. 112, 116-117, and n. 8 (1952); Hallowell v. Commons, 239 U. S.
            506 (1916); cf. Ex parte McCardle, <span class="citation">

            97 Eng. Rep. 924 (K. B. 1764). The Court explains this aspect of our retroactivity
            jurisprudence by noting that "a new jurisdictional rule" will often not involve
            retroactivity in Justice Story's sense because it "`takes away no substantive right but
            simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case.' " Ante, at 274, quoting
            Hallowell, supra, at 508. That may be true sometimes, but surely not always. A
            jurisdictional rule can deny a litigant a forum for his claim <span
               class="star-pagination">*293</span> entirely, see Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, 61
            Stat. 84, as amended, 29 U. S. C. §§ 251-262, or may leave him with an alternate forum
            that will deny relief for some collateral reason (e. g., a statute of limitations bar).
            Our jurisdiction cases are explained, I think, by the fact that the purpose of
            provisions conferring or eliminating jurisdiction is to permit or forbid the exercise of
            judicial power&#x97;so that the relevant event for retroactivity purposes is the moment
            at which that power is sought to be exercised. Thus, applying a jurisdiction-eliminating
            statute to undo past judicial action would be applying it retroactively; but applying it
            to prevent any judicial action after the statute takes effect is applying it
            prospectively.</p>
         <p>Finally, statutes eliminating previously available forms of prospective relief provide
            another challenge to the Court's approach. Courts traditionally withhold requested
            injunctions that are not authorized by then-current law, even if they were authorized at
            the time suit commenced and at the time the primary conduct sought to be enjoined was
            first engaged in. See, e. g., American Steel Foundries v. TriCity Central Trades
            Council, 257 U. S. 184 (1921); Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U. S. 443, 464
            (1921). The reason, which has nothing to do with whether it is possible to have a vested
            right to prospective relief, is that "[o]bviously, this form of relief operates only in
            futuro, " ibid. Since the purpose of prospective relief is to affect the future rather
            than remedy the past, the relevant time for judging its retroactivity is the very moment
            at which it is ordered.<span class="sup">[3]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*294</span> I do not maintain that it will always be easy
            to determine, from the statute's purpose, the relevant event for assessing its
            retroactivity. As I have suggested, for example, a statutory provision for attorney's
            fees presents a difficult case. Ordinarily, however, the answer is clear&#x97;as it is
            in both Landgraf and Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., post, p. 298. Unlike the Court, I
            do not think that any of the provisions at issue is "not easily classified," ante, at
            281. They are all directed at the regulation of primary conduct, and the occurrence of
            the primary conduct is the relevant event.</p>

         <p>A straightforward textual analysis of the Act indicates that § 102's provision of
            compensatory damages and its attendant right to a jury trial apply to cases pending on
            appeal on the date of enactment. This analysis begins with § 402(a) of the Act, 105
            Stat. 1099: "Except as otherwise specifically provided, this Act and the amendments made
            by this Act <span class="star-pagination">*295</span> shall take effect upon enactment."
            Under the "settled rule that a statute must, if possible, be construed in such fashion
            that every word has operative effect," United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S.
            30, 36 (1992), citing United States v. Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538-539 (1955), §
            402(a)'s qualifying clause, "[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided," cannot be
            dismissed as mere surplusage or an "insurance policy" against future judicial
            interpretation. Cf. Gersman v. Group Health Assn., Inc., 975 F. 2d 886, 890 (CADC 1992).
            Instead, it most logically refers to the Act's two sections "specifically provid[ing]"
            that the statute does not apply to cases pending on the date of enactment: (a) § 402(b),
            105 Stat. 1099, which provides, in effect, that the Act did not apply to the
            then-pending case of Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642 (1989), and (b) §
            109(c), 105 Stat. 1078, which states that the Act's protections of overseas employment
            "shall not apply with respect to conduct occurring before the date of the enactment of
            this Act." Self-evidently, if the entire Act were inapplicable to pending cases, §§
            402(b) and 109(c) would be "entirely redundant." Kungys v. United States, 485 U. S. 759,
            778 (1988) (plurality opinion). Thus, the clear implication is that, while §§ 402(b) and
            109(c) do not apply to pending cases, other provisions&#x97;including § 102&#x97;
               do.<span class="sup">[1]</span> "`Absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to
            the contrary, [this] language must . . . be regarded as conclusive.' " Kaiser , 494 U.
            S., at 835, quoting Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U. S., at
            108. The legislative history of the Act, featuring a welter of conflicting and "some
            frankly partisan" floor statements, ante, at 262, but no committee report, evinces no
            such contrary <span class="star-pagination">*296</span> legislative intent.<span
               class="sup">[2]</span> Thus, I see no reason to dismiss as "unlikely," ante, at 259,
            the most natural reading of the statute, in order to embrace some other reading that is
            also "possible," ante, at 260.</p>
         <p>Even if the language of the statute did not answer the retroactivity question, it would
            be appropriate under our precedents to apply § 102 to pending cases.<span class="sup"
               >[3]</span> The wellestablished presumption against retroactive legislation, which
            serves to protect settled expectations, is grounded in a respect for vested rights. See,
            e. g., Smead, The Rule Against Retroactive Legislation: A Basic Principle of
            Jurisprudence, 20 Minn. L. Rev. 775, 784 (1936) (retroactivity <span
               class="star-pagination">*297</span> doctrine developed as an "inhibition against a
            construction which . . . would violate vested rights"). This presumption need not be
            applied to remedial legislation, such as § 102, that does not proscribe any conduct that
            was previously legal. See Sampeyreac v. United States, <span class="citation no-link">

            disturb absolute vested rights").</p>

            p. 349 (4th rev. ed. 1986) (procedural and remedial statutes that do not take away
            vested rights are presumed to apply to pending actions). Section 102 of the Act expands
            the remedies available for acts of intentional discrimination, but does not alter the
            scope of the employee's basic right to be free from discrimination or the employer's
            corresponding legal duty. There is nothing unjust about holding an employer responsible
            for injuries caused by conduct that has been illegal for almost 30 years.</p>

            § 102 of the 1991 Act. For simplicity, and in conformity with the practice of the
            parties, we will refer to the damages and jury trial provisions as §§ 102(a) and (c),
            respectively.</p>
         <p>[2] Respondent Quantum Chemical Corporation owned the USI plant when petitioner worked
            there. Respondent Bonar Packaging, Inc., subsequently purchased the operation.</p>
         <p>[3] Section 2(2)finds that the Wards Cove decision "has weakened the scope and
            effectiveness of Federal civilrights protections,"and § 3(2) expresses Congress' intent
            "to codify" certain concepts enunciated in "Supreme Court decisions prior to Wards Cove
            Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642 (1989)." We take note of the express references to
            that case because it is the focus of § 402(b),on which petitioner places particular
            reliance. See infra, at 258-263.</p>
         <p>[4] We have not decided whether a plaintiff seeking backpay under Title VII is entitled
            to a jury trial. See, e. g., Lytle v. Household Mfg., Inc., 494 U. S. 545, 549, n. 1
            (1990) (assuming without deciding no right to jury trial); Teamsters v. Terry, 494 U. S.
            558, 572 (1990) (same). Because petitioner does not argue that she had a right to jury
            trial even under pre-1991 law, again we need not address this question.</p>
         <p>[5] "If the court finds that the respondent has intentionally engaged in . . . an

            reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without back pay .. .or any other
            equitable reliefas thecourt deems appropriate. Back pay liabilityshall not accrue from a
            date more than two years prior to the filing of a charge with the Commission. Interim
            earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons
            discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable." Civil

            IV).</p>
         <p>[6] Section 102(b)(3) imposes limits, varying with the size of the employer, on the
            amount of compensatory and punitive damages that may be awarded to an individual
            plaintiff.Thus, the sum of such damages awarded a plaintiff may not exceed $50,000 for
            employers with between 14 and 100 employees; $100,000 for employers with between 101 and
            200 employees; $200,000 for employers with between 200 and 500 employees; and $300,000
            for employers with more than 500 employees.</p>

            Act of 1990, 26 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 1632-1634 (Oct. 22, 1990), reprinted in 136
            Cong. Rec. S16418, S16419 (Oct. 22, 1990). The President's veto message referred to the
            bill's "retroactivity" only briefly; the Attorney General's Memorandum to which the
            President referred was no more expansive, and may be read to refer only to the bill's
            special provision for reopening final judgments, see n. 8, supra, rather than its
            provisions covering pending cases. See Memorandum of the Attorney General to the
            President (Oct. 22, 1990) in App. to Brief for Petitioner A-13 ("And Section 15 unfairly
            applies the changes in the law made by S. 2104 to cases already decided ") (emphasis
            added).</p>
         <p>[10] The history of prior amendments to Title VII suggests that the
            "effective-upon-enactment" formula would have been an especially inapt way to reach
            pending cases. When it amended Title VII in the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of
            1972, Congress explicitly provided: </p>
         <p>"The amendments made by this Act to section 706 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 shall be
            applicable with respect to charges pending with the Commission on the date of enactment
            of this Act and all charges filed thereafter." Pub. L. 92-261, § 14, 86 Stat. 113. In
            contrast, in amending Title VII to bar discrimination on the basis of pregnancy in 1978,
            Congress provided:</p>
         <p>"Except as provided in subsection (b), the amendment made by this Act shall be effective
            on the date of enactment." § 2(a), 92 Stat. 2076. The only Courts of Appeals to consider
            whether the 1978 amendments applied to pending cases concluded that they did not. See
            Schwabenbauer v. Board of Ed. of School Dist. of Olean, 667 F. 2d 305, 310, n. 7 (CA2
            1981); Condit v. United Air Lines, Inc., 631 F. 2d 1136, 1139-1140 (CA4 1980). See also
            Jensen v. Gulf Oil Refining &amp;amp; Marketing Co., 623 F. 2d 406, 410 (CA5 1980) (Age
            Discrimination in Employment Act amendments designated to "take effect on the date of
            enactment of this Act" inapplicable to case arising before enactment); Sikora v.
            American Can Co., 622 F. 2d 1116, 1119-1124 (CA3 1980) (same). If we assume that
            Congress was familiar with those decisions, cf.Cannon v.University of Chicago, 441 U. S.
            677, 698-699 (1979),its choice of language in § 402(a) would imply nonretroactivity.</p>
         <p>[11] There is some evidence that the drafters of the 1991 Act did not devote particular
            attention to the interplay of the Act's "effective date" provisions. Section 110, which
            directs the EEOC to establish a "Technical Assistance Training Institute" to assist
            employers in complying with antidiscrimination laws and regulations, contains a
            subsection providing that it "shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this
            Act." § 110(b). That provision and § 402(a) are unavoidably redundant.</p>
         <p>[12] This point also diminishes the force of petitioner's "expressio unius " argument.
            Once one abandons the unsupported assumption that Congress expected that all of the
            Act's provisions would be treated alike, and takes account of uncertainty about the
            applicable default rule,§§ 109(c) and 402(b) do not carry the negative implication
            petitioner draws from them. We do not read either provision as doing anything more than
            definitively rejecting retroactivity with respect to the specific matters covered by its
            plain language.</p>
         <p>[13] See, e. g., H. R. 1, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. § 113 (1991), reprinted in 137 Cong.
            Rec. H3924&#x97;H3925 (Jan. 3, 1991). The prospectivity proviso to the section extending
            Title VII to overseas employers was first added to legislation that generally was to
            apply to pending cases. See H. R. 1, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. § 119(c) (1991), reprinted in
            137 Cong. Rec. H3925&#x97;H3926 (June 5, 1991). Thus, at the time its language was
            introduced, the provision that became § 109(c) was surely not redundant.</p>
         <p>[14] On the other hand, two proposals that would have provided explicitly for
            prospectivity also foundered. See 137 Cong. Rec. S3021, S3023 (Mar. 12, 1991); id., at
            13255, 13265-13266.</p>
         <p>[15] For example, in an "interpretive memorandum" introduced on behalf of seven
            Republican sponsors of S. 1745, the bill that became the 1991 Act, Senator Danforth
            stated that "[t]he bill provides that, unless otherwise specified, the provisions of
            this legislation shall take effect upon enactment and shall not apply retroactively. "
            Id., at 29047 (emphasis added). Senator Kennedy responded that it "will be up to the
            courts to determine the extent to which the bill will apply to cases and claims that
            were pending on the date of enactment." Ibid. (citing Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond,
            416 U. S. 696 (1974)). The legislative history reveals other partisan statements on the
            proper meaning of the Act's "effective date" provisions. Senator Danforth observed that
            such statements carry little weight as legislative history. As he put it: </p>
         <p>"[A] court would be well advised to take with a large grain of salt floor debate and
            statements placed in the Congressional Record which purport to create an interpretation
            for the legislation that is before us." 137 Cong. Rec. S15325 (Oct. 29, 1991).</p>

            about How Statutes are to be Construed, 3 Vand. L. Rev. 395 (1950). Llewellyn's article
            identified the apparent conflict between the canon that </p>
         <p>"[a] statute imposing a new penalty or forfeiture, or a new liability or disability, or
            creating a new right of action will not be construed as having a retroactive effect" and

            primarily policymaking bodies that promulgate rules to govern future conduct. The
            constitutional prohibitions against the enactment of ex post facto laws and bills of
            attainder reflect a valid concern about the use of the political process to punish or
            characterize past conduct of private citizens. It is the judicial system, rather than
            the legislative process, that is best equipped to identify past wrongdoers and to
            fashion remedies that will create the conditions that presumably would have existed had
            no wrong been committed") (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment);
            James v. United States, 366 U. S. 213, 247, n. 3 (1961) (retroactive punitive measures
            may reflect "a purpose not to prevent dangerous conduct generally but to impose by
            legislation a penalty against specific persons or classes of persons"). </p>
         <p>James Madison argued that retroactive legislation also offered special opportunities for
            the powerful to obtain special and improper legislative benefits. According to Madison,
            "[b]ills of attainder, ex post facto laws, and laws impairing the obligation of
            contracts" were "contrary to the first principles of the social compact, and to every
            principle of sound legislation," in part because such measures invited the "influential"
            to "speculat[e] on public measures," to the detriment of the "more industrious and less
            informed part of the community." The <ref type="" num="44">Federalist</ref> No. 44, p. 301 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). See
            Hochman, The Supreme Court and the Constitutionality of Retroactive Legislation, 73
            Harv. L. Rev. 692, 693 (1960) (a retroactive statute "may be passed with an exact
            knowledge of who will benefit from it").</p>
         <p>[21] In some cases, however, the interest in avoiding the adjudication of constitutional
            questions will counsel against a retroactive application. For if a challenged statute is
            to be given retroactive effect, the regulatory interest that supports prospective
            application will not necessarily also sustain its application to past events. See
            Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. R. A. Gray &amp;amp; Co., 467 U. S. 717, 730
            (1984); Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U. S. 1, 17 (1976). In this case the
            punitive damages provision may raise a question, but for present purposes we assume that
            Congress has ample power to provide for retroactive application of § 102.</p>
         <p>[22] Article 23 of the New Hampshire Bill of Rights provides: "Retrospective laws are
            highly injurious, oppressive and unjust. No such laws, therefore, should be made, either
            for the decision of civil causes or the punishment of offenses." At issue in the Society
            case was a new statute that reversed a common-law rule by allowing certain wrongful
            possessors of land, upon being ejected by the rightful owner, to obtain compensation for
            improvements made on the land. Justice Story held that the new statute impaired the
            owner's rights and thus could not, consistently with Article 23, be applied to require
            compensation for improvements made before the statute's enactment. See 22 F. Cas., at
            766-769.</p>
         <p>[23] See, e. g., Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S. 423, 430 (1987) ("A law is retrospective
            if it `changes the legal consequences of acts completed before its effective date' ")
            (quoting Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 31 (1981)); Union Pacific R. Co. v. Laramie
            Stock Yards Co., 231 U. S. 190, 199 (1913) (retroactive statute gives "a quality or
            effect to acts or conduct which they did not have or did not contemplate when they were
            performed"); Sturges v. Carter, 114 U. S. 511, 519 (1885) (a retroactive statute is one
            that "takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new
            obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability"). See also Black's Law
            Dictionary 1184 (5th ed. 1979) (quoting Justice Story's definition from Society ); 2 N.
            Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction § 41.01, p. 337 (5th rev. ed. 1993) ("The
            terms `retroactive' and `retrospective' are synonymous in judicial usage . . . . They
            describe acts which operate on transactions which have occurred or rights and
            obligations which existed before passage of the act").</p>
         <p>[24] Even uncontroversially prospective statutes may unsettle expectations and impose
            burdens on past conduct: a new property tax or zoning regulation may upset the
            reasonable expectations that prompted those affected to acquire property; a new law
            banning gambling harms the person who had begun to construct a casino before the law's
            enactment or spent his life learning to count cards. See Fuller 60 ("If every time a man
            relied on existing law in arranging his affairs, he were made secure against any change
            in legal rules, the whole body of our law would be ossified forever"). Moreover, a
            statute "is not made retroactive merely because it draws upon antecedent facts for its
            operation." Cox v.Hart, 260 U. S. 427, 435 (1922). See Reynolds v. United States, 292 U.

         <p>[27] In Bruner, we specifically noted: </p>
         <p>"This jurisdictional rule does not affect the general principle that a statute is not to
            be given retroactive effect unless such construction is required by explicit language or
            by necessary implication. Compare United States v. St. Louis, S. F. &amp;amp; T. R. Co.,
            270 U. S. 1, 3 (1926), with Smallwood v. Gallardo, 275 U. S. 56, 61 (1927)." 343 U. S.,
            at 117, n. 8.</p>
         <p>[28] While we have strictly construed the Ex Post Facto Clause to prohibit application
            of new statutes creating or increasing punishments after the fact, we have upheld
            intervening procedural changes even if application of the new rule operated to a
            defendant's disadvantage in the particular case. See, e. g., Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U.
            S. 282, 293-294 (1977); see also Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37 (1990); Beazell v.
            Ohio, 269 U. S. 167 (1925).</p>
         <p>[29] Of course, the mere fact that a new rule is procedural does not mean that it
            applies to every pending case. A new rule concerning the filing of complaints would not
            govern an action in which the complaint had already been properly filed under the old
            regime, and the promulgation of a new rule of evidence would not require an appellate
            remand for a new trial. Our orders approving amendments to federal procedural rules
            reflect the commonsense notion that the applicability of such provisions ordinarily
            depends on the posture of the particular case. See, e. g., Order Amending Federal Rules
            of Criminal Procedure, 495 U. S. 969 (1990) (amendments applicable to pending cases
            "insofar as just and practicable"); Order Amending Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 456
            U. S. 1015 (1982) (same); Order Amending Bankruptcy Rules and Forms, 421 U. S. 1021
            (1975) (amendments applicable to pending cases "except to the extent that in the opinion
            of the court their application in a particular proceeding then pending would not be
            feasible or would work injustice"). Contrary to Justice Scalia's suggestion, post, at
            290, we do not restrict the presumption against statutory retroactivity to cases
            involving "vested rights." (Neither is Justice Story's definition of retroactivity,
            quoted supra, at 269, so restricted.) Nor do we suggest that concerns about
            retroactivity have no application to procedural rules.</p>
         <p>[30] Thorpe is consistent with the principle, analogous to that at work in the
            common-law presumption about repeals of criminal statutes, that the government should
            accord grace to private parties disadvantaged by an old rule when it adopts a new and
            more generous one. Cf. DeGurules v. INS, 833 F. 2d 861, 862-863 (CA9 1987). Indeed,
            Thorpe twice cited United States v. Chambers, 291 U. S. 217 (1934), which ordered
            dismissal of prosecutions pending when the National Prohibition Act was repealed. See
            Thorpe, 393 U. S., at 281, n. 38; id., at 282, n.40.</p>
         <p>[31] In Bradley, we cited Schooner Peggy for the "current law" principle, but we
            recognized that the law at issue in Schooner Peggy had expressly called for retroactive
            application. See 416 U. S., at 712, n. 16 (describing Schooner Peggy as holding that
            Court was obligated to "apply the terms of the convention," which had recited that it
            applied to all vessels not yet "definitively condemned") (emphasis in convention).</p>
         <p>[32] At the time Bradley was decided, it was by no means a truism to point out that
            rules announced in intervening judicial decisions should normally be applied to a case
            pending when the intervening decision came down. In 1974, our doctrine on judicial
            retroactivity involved a substantial measure of discretion, guided by equitable
            standards resembling the Bradley "manifest injustice" test itself. See Chevron Oil Co.
            v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97, 106-107 (1971); Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618, 636 (1965).
            While it was accurate in 1974 to say that a new rule announced in a judicial decision
            was only presumptively applicable to pending cases, we have since established a firm
            rule of retroactivity. See Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 509 U. S. 86 (1993);
            Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987).</p>

         <p>[34] As the Court of Appeals recognized, however, the promulgation of a new jury trial
            rule would ordinarily not warrant retrial of cases that had previously been tried to a
            judge. See n. 29, supra. Thus, customary practice would not support remand for a jury
            trial in this case.</p>
         <p>[35] As petitioner and amici suggest, concerns of unfair surprise and upsetting
            expectations are attenuated in the case of intentional employment discrimination, which
            has been unlawful for more than a generation. However, fairness concerns would not be
            entirely absent if the damages provisions of § 102 were to apply to events preceding its
            enactment, as the facts of this case illustrate. Respondent USI's management, when
            apprised of the wrongful conduct of petitioner's co-worker, took timely action to remedy
            the problem. The law then in effect imposed no liability on an employer who corrected
            discriminatory work conditions before the conditions became so severe as to result in
            the victim's constructive discharge. Assessing damages against respondents on a theory
            of respondeat superior would thus entail an element of surprise. Even when the conduct
            in question is morally reprehensible or illegal, a degree of unfairness is inherent
            whenever the law imposes additional burdens based on conduct that occurred in the past.
            Cf. Weaver, 450 U. S., at 28-30 (Ex Post Facto Clause assures fair notice and
            governmental restraint, and does not turn on "an individual's right to less
            punishment"). The new damages provisions of § 102 can be expected to give managers an
            added incentive to take preventive measures to ward off discriminatory conduct by
            subordinates before itoccurs, but that purpose is not served by applying the regime to
            preenactment conduct.</p>
         <p>[36] The state courts have consistently held that statutes changing or abolishing limits
            on the amount of damages available in wrongful-death actions should not, in the absence
            of clear legislative intent, apply to actions arising before their enactment. See, e.
            g., Dempsey v. State, 451 A. 2d 273 (R. I. 1982) ("Every court which has considered the
            issue . . . has found that a subsequent change as to the amount or the elements of
            damage in the wrongful-death statute to be substantive rather than procedural or
            remedial, and thus any such change must be applied prospectively"); Kleibrink v.

            for wrongful death to misconduct occurring before effective date; "statutory increases
            in damage[s] limitations are actually changes in substantive rights and not mere
            remedial changes"); State ex rel. St. Louis-San Francisco R. Co. v. Buder, 515 S. W. 2d

            were ascribed at the time they transpired, should not, without cogent reasons,
            thereafter be subject to a different set of effects which alter the rights and
            liabilities of the parties thereto"); Mihoy v. Proulx, 113 N. H. 698, 701, 313 A. 2d
            723, 725 (1973) ("To apply the increased limit after the date of the accident would
            clearly enlarge the defendant's liability retrospectively. In the absence of an express
            provision, we cannot conclude that the legislature intended retrospective application").
            See also Fann v. McGuffy, 534 S. W. 2d 770, 774, n. 19 (Ky. 1975); Muckler v. Buchl, 150

         <p>[37] We have sometimes said that new "remedial" statutes, like new "procedural" ones,
            should presumptively apply to pending cases. See, e. g., Ex parte Collett, 337 U. S., at
            71, and n. 38 ("Clearly, § 1404(a) is a remedial provision applicable to pending
            actions"); Beazell, 269 U. S., at 171 (Ex Post Facto Clause does not limit "legislative
            control of remedies and modes of procedure which do not affect matters of substance").
            While that statement holds true for some kinds of remedies, see supra, at 273&#x97; 274
            (discussing prospective relief), we have not classified a statute introducing damages
            liability as the sort of "remedial" change that should presumptively apply in pending
            cases. "Retroactive modification" of damages remedies may "normally harbo[r] much less
            potential for mischief than retroactive changes in the principles of liability,"
            Hastings v. Earth Satellite Corp., 628 F. 2d 85, 93 (CADC), cert. denied, 449 U. S. 905
            (1980), but that potential is nevertheless still significant.</p>
         <p>[38] Petitioner argues that our decision in Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools,
            503 U. S. 60 (1992), supports application of § 102 to her case. Relying on the principle
            that "where legal rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for a general
            right to sue for such invasion, federal courts may use any available remedy to make good
            the wrong,' " id., at 66 (quoting Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946)), we held in
            Franklin that the right of action under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972
            included a claim for damages. Petitioner argues that Franklin supports her position
            because, if she cannot obtain damages pursuant to § 102, she will be left remediless
            despite an adjudged violation of her right under Title VII to be free of workplace
            discrimination. However, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is not a statute to
            which we would apply the "traditional presumption in favor of all available remedies."
            503 U. S., at 72. That statute did not create a "general right to sue" for employment
            discrimination, but instead specified a set of "circumscribed remedies." See United
            States v. Burke, 504 U. S. 229, 240 (1992). Until the 1991 amendment, the Title VII
            scheme did not allow for damages. We are not free to fashion remedies that Congress has
            specifically chosen not to extend. See Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers,
            451 U. S. 77, 97 (1981).</p>
         <p>[*] [This opinion applies also to Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., No. 92&#x97; 938,
            post, p. 298.]</p>
         <p>[1] In one respect, I must acknowledge, the Court's effort may be unique. There is
            novelty as well as irony in its supporting the judgment that the floor statements on the
            1991 Act are unreliable by citing Senator Danforth's floor statement on the 1991 Act to
            the effect that floor statements on the 1991 Act are unreliable. See ante, at 262-263,
            n. 15.</p>
         <p>[2] Petitioner suggests that in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1 (1989), the
            Court found the negative implication of language sufficient to satisfy the "clear
            statement" requirement for congressional subjection of the States to private suit, see
            Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985). However, in that case
            it was the express inclusion of States in the definition of potentially liable
            "person[s]," see 42 U. S. C. § 9601(21),as reinforced by the limitation of States'
            liability in certain limited circumstances, see § 9601(20)(D), that led the Court to
            find a plain statement of liability.See 491 U. S., at 11 (noting the "cascade of plain
            language" supporting liability); id., at 30 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and
            dissenting in part). There is nothing comparable here.</p>
         <p>[3] A focus on the relevant retroactivity event also explains why the presumption
            against retroactivity is not violated by interpreting a statute to alter the future
            legal effect of past transactions&#x97;so-called secondary retroactivity, see Bowen v.
            Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 219&#x97; 220 (1988) (Scalia, J., concurring)
            (citing McNulty, Corporations and the Intertemporal Conflict of Laws, 55 Calif. L. Rev.
            12, 58-60 (1967)); cf. Cox v. Hart, 260 U. S. 427, 435 (1922). A new ban on gambling
            applies to existing casinos and casinos under construction, see ante, at 269-270, n. 24,
            even though it "attaches a new disability" to those past investments. The relevant
            retroactivity event is the primary activity of gambling, not the primary activity of
            constructing casinos.</p>
         <p>[1] It is, of course, an "unexceptional" proposition that "a particular statute may in
            some circumstances implicitly authorize retroactive [application]." Bowen v. Georgetown
            Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 223 (1988) (concurring opinion) (emphasis added).</p>
         <p>[2] Virtually every Court of Appeals to consider the application of the 1991 Act to
            pending cases has concluded that the legislative history provides no reliable guidance.
            See, e. g., Gersman v. Group Health Assn., Inc., 975 F. 2d 886 (CADC 1992); Mozee v.
            American Commercial Marine Service Co., 963 F. 2d 929 (CA7 1992). </p>
         <p>The absence in the Act of the strong retroactivity language of the vetoed 1990
            legislation, which would have applied the new law to final judgments as well as to
            pending cases, see H. R. 4000, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., § 15(b)(3) (1990), reprinted at
            136 Cong. Rec. H6829 (Aug. 3, 1990) (providing that "any final judgment entered prior to
            the date of the enactment of this Act as to which the rights of any of the parties
            thereto have become fixed and vested . . . shall be vacated in whole or in part if
            justice requires" and the Constitution permits), is not instructive of Congress' intent
            with respect to pending cases alone. Significantly, Congress also rejected language that
            put pending claims beyond the reach of the 1990 or 1991 Act. See id., at H6747
            (Michel-LaFalce amendment to 1990 Act) ("The amendments made by this Act shall not apply
            with respect to claims arising before the date of enactment of this Act"); id., at H6768
            (Michel-LaFalce amendment rejected); 137 Cong. Rec. S3023 (daily ed. Mar. 12, 1991)
            (Sen. Dole's introduction of S. 611, which included the 1990 Act's retroactivity
            provision); id., at 13255, 13265-13266 (introduction and defeat of Michel substitute for
            H. R. 1).</p>
         <p>[3] Directly at issue in this case are compensatory damages and the right to a jury
            trial. While there is little unfairness in requiring an employer to compensate the
            victims of intentional acts of discrimination, or to have a jury determine those
            damages, the imposition of punitive damages for preenactment conduct represents a more
            difficult question, one not squarely addressed in this case and one on which I express
            no opinion.</p>
