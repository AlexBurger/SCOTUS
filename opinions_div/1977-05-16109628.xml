         <p>MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
         <p>Petitioner Jones is Director of the Department of Weights and Measures in Riverside
            County, Cal.<span class="sup">[1]</span> In that capacity he ordered removed from sale
            bacon packaged by respondent Rath Packing Co. and flour packaged by three millers,
            respondents General Mills, Inc., Pillsbury Co., and Seaboard Allied Milling Corp.
            (hereafter millers). Jones acted after determining, by means of procedures set forth in
            4 Cal. Admin. Code c. 8, Art. 5, that the packages were contained in lots<span
               class="sup">[2]</span> whose average net weight was less than the net weight stated
            on the packages. The removal orders were authorized by Cal. Bus. &amp;amp; Prof. Code §
            12211 (West Supp. 1977).<span class="sup">[3]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*523</span> Rath and the millers responded by filing suits
            in the District Court for the Central District of California.<span class="sup"
               >[4]</span> They sought both declarations that § 12211 and Art. 5 are pre-empted
               <span class="star-pagination">*524</span> by federal laws regulating net-weight
            labeling and injunctions prohibiting Jones from enforcing those provisions. The District
            Court granted the requested relief<span class="sup">[5]</span> and, insofar as is
            relevant here, the Court of Appeals affirmed.<span class="sup">[6]</span> We granted
            Jones' petition for certiorari, 425 U. S. 933 (1976),<span class="sup">[7]</span> and
            now affirm the judgments of the Court of Appeals.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>In its present posture, this litigation contains no claim that the Constitution alone
            denies California power to enact <span class="star-pagination">*525</span> the
            challenged provisions.<span class="sup">[8]</span> We are required to decide only
            whether the federal laws which govern respondents' packing operations preclude
            California from enforcing § 12211, as implemented by Art. 5.</p>
         <p>Our prior decisions have clearly laid out the path we must follow to answer this
            question. The first inquiry is whether Congress, pursuant to its power to regulate
            commerce, U. S. Const., Art. 1, § 8, has prohibited state regulation of the particular
            aspects of commerce involved in this case. Where, as here, the field which Congress is
            said to have pre-empted has been traditionally occupied by the States, see, e. g., U. S.
            Const., Art. I, § 10; Patapsco Guano Co. v. North Carolina, 171 U. S. 345, 358 (1898),
            "we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to
            be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of
            Congress." Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947). This assumption
            provides assurance that "the federal-state balance," United States v. Bass, 404 U. S.
            336, 349 (1971), will not be disturbed unintentionally by Congress or unnecessarily by
            the courts. But when Congress has "unmistakably . . . ordained," Florida Lime &amp;amp;
            Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132, 142 (1963), that its enactments alone are
            to regulate a part of commerce, state laws regulating that aspect of commerce must fall.
            This result is compelled whether Congress' command is explicitly stated in the statute's
            language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose. City of Burbank v.
            Lockheed Air Terminal, Inc., 411 U. S. 624, 633 (1973); Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,
            supra, at 230.</p>
         <p>Congressional enactments that do not exclude all state legislation in the same field
            nevertheless override state laws <span class="star-pagination">*526</span> with which
            they conflict. U. S. Const., Art. VI. The criterion for determining whether state and
            federal laws are so inconsistent that the state law must give way is firmly established
            in our decisions. Our task is "to determine whether, under the circumstances of this
            particular case, [the State's] law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and
            execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress." Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.
            S. 52, 67 (1941). Accord, De Canas v. Bica, 424 U. S. 351, 363 (1976); Perez v.
            Campbell, 402 U. S. 637, 649 (1971); Florida Lime &amp;amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v.
            Paul, supra, at 141; id., at 165 (WHITE, J., dissenting). This inquiry requires us to
            consider the relationship between state and federal laws as they are interpreted and
            applied, not merely as they are written. See De Canas v. Bica, supra, at 363-365; Swift

         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>Section 12211 of the Cal. Bus. &amp;amp; Prof. Code (West Supp. 1977) applies to both
            Rath's bacon and the millers' flour. The standard it establishes is straightforward:
            "[T]he average weight or measure of the packages or containers in a lot of any . . .
            commodity sampled shall not be less, at the time of sale or offer for sale, than the net
            weight or measure stated upon the package."</p>
         <p>In order to determine whether that standard has been violated, local officials such as
            Jones follow the statistical sampling procedure set forth in Art. 5.<span class="sup"
               >[9]</span> That procedure requires the inspector to identify a lot of identical
            packages of a commodity and determine the number of packages in that lot. <span
               class="star-pagination">*527</span> He then determines, from tables in the
            regulation, the number of packages necessary to provide a suitable sample of the lot,
            and a smaller number of packages which is used to determine the average tare.<span
               class="sup">[10]</span> After determining that average, the inspector weighs each
            package in the sample, subtracts the average tare, and records the difference between
            the measured and the stated net weights. These measurements are used to identify
            individual packages in the sample which deviate unreasonably from the stated weight.
            Those packages are replaced<span class="sup">[11]</span> in the sample and the
            replacements weighed. <span class="star-pagination">*528</span> Finally, the deviations
            from the stated weight are totaled algebraically and compared with tables which indicate
            the magnitude of the total error necessary to conclude that the lot's average weight is
            or is not less than the stated weight.<span class="sup">[12]</span>
         </p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>A. Rath's bacon is produced at plants subject to federal inspection under the Federal
            Meat Inspection Act (FMIA or Act), as amended by the Wholesome Meat Act, 81 Stat. 584,
            21 U. S. C. § 601 et seq. Among the requirements imposed on federally inspected plants,
            and enforced by Department of Agriculture inspectors,<span class="sup">[13]</span> are
            standards of accuracy in labeling. On the record before us, we may assume that Rath's
            bacon complies with these standards.<span class="sup">[14]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The federal labeling requirement is imposed by § 7 (b) of the FMIA, 81 Stat. 588, 21 U.
            S. C. § 607 (b), which commands:</p> "All . . . meat and meat food products inspected at
         any <span class="star-pagination">*529</span> establishment under the authority of this
         title . . . shall at the time they leave the establishment bear . . . the information
         required under paragraph (n) of section 1 of this Act." <p>Section 1 (n) of the FMIA, 21 U.
            S. C. § 601 (n), defines the term "misbranded." As relevant here, it provides that meat
            or a meat product is misbranded</p> "(5) if in a package or other container unless it
         bears a label showing . . . (B) an accurate statement of the quantity of the contents in
         terms of weight, measure, or numerical count: Provided, That . . . reasonable variations
         may be permitted, and exemptions as to small packages may be established, by regulations
         prescribed by the Secretary." 81 Stat. 586. <p>Other sections of the FMIA prohibit dealing
            in misbranded products, as defined by § 1 (n).<span class="sup">[15]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The Secretary of Agriculture has used his discretionary authority to permit "reasonable
            variations" in the accuracy of the required statement of quantity:</p> "The statement
         [of net quantity of contents] as it is shown on a label shall not be false or misleading
         and shall express an accurate statement of the quantity of contents of the container
         exclusive of wrappers and packing substances. Reasonable variations caused by loss or gain
         of moisture during the course of good distribution practices or by unavoidable deviations
         in good manufacturing practice will be recognized. Variations from stated quantity of
         contents shall not be unreasonably large." 9 CFR § 317.2 (h) (2) (1976). <p>Thus, the FMIA,
            as implemented by statutorily authorized regulations, requires the label of a meat
            product accurately to indicate the net weight of the contents unless the difference
               <span class="star-pagination">*530</span> between stated and actual weights is
            reasonable and results from the specified causes.<span class="sup">[16]</span>
         </p>
         <p>B. Section 408 of the FMIA, 21 U. S. C. § 678, prohibits the imposition of "[m]arking,
            labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirements in addition to, or different than, those
            made under" the Act.<span class="sup">[17]</span> This explicit pre-emption provision
               <span class="star-pagination">*531</span> dictates the result in the controversy
            between Jones and Rath. California's use of a statistical sampling process to determine
            the average net weight of a lot implicitly allows for variations from stated weight
            caused by unavoidable deviations in the manufacturing process.<span class="sup"
               >[18]</span> But California makes no allowance for loss of weight resulting from
            moisture loss during the course of good distribution practice.<span class="sup"
               >[19]</span> Thus, the state <span class="star-pagination">*532</span> law's
            requirement&#x97;that the label accurately state the net weight, with implicit allowance
            only for reasonable manufacturing variations&#x97;is "different than" the federal
            requirement, which permits manufacturing deviations and variations caused by moisture
            loss during good distribution practice.</p>
         <p>Petitioner Jones seeks to avoid this result by arguing that the FMIA's provisions
            governing the accuracy of the required net-quantity statements are not "labeling
            requirements" within the meaning of § 408. He contends that "labeling" refers only to
            the format and placement of information, not to its content.<span class="sup"
               >[20]</span> Requirements relating to accuracy, according to Jones, deal with the
            problem of misbranding, and § 408 grants the States concurrent jurisdiction over that
            subject.</p>
         <p>We agree with the Court of Appeals that this argument is "strained." 530 F. 2d, at 1314
            n. 25. Nothing in the Act suggests the restrictive meaning petitioner ascribes to the
            phrase "labeling requirements." To the contrary, § 7 (b) requires that the product bear
            specified information, see supra, at 528-529, and § 1 (p) of the FMIA, 21 U. S. C. § 601
               (p),<span class="sup">[21]</span> makes clear that any material bearing that
            information is part of the product's labeling. It twists the language beyond the
            breaking point to say that a law mandating that labeling contain certain information is
            not a "labeling requirement."</p>
         <p>We therefore conclude that with respect to Rath's packaged bacon, § 12211 and Art. 5 are
            pre-empted by federal law.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>IV</h2>
         <p>A. The federal law governing net-weight labeling of the millers' flour is contained in
            two statutes, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 52 Stat. 1040, as
            amended, <span class="star-pagination">*533</span> 21 U. S. C. § 301 et seq., and the
            Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA), 80 Stat. 1296, as amended, 15 U. S. C. §§
            1451-1461. For the reasons stated below, we conclude that the federal weight-labeling
            standard for flour is the same as that for meat.</p>
         <p>The FDCA prohibits the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate
            commerce of any food<span class="sup">[22]</span> that is misbranded. 21 U. S. C. § 331.
            A food is misbranded under the FDCA,</p> "[i]f in package form unless it bears a label
         containing. . . an accurate statement of the quantity of the contents in terms of weight,
         measure, or numerical count: Provided, That . . . reasonable variations shall be permitted,
         and exemptions as to small packages shall be established, by regulations prescribed by the
         Secretary." § 343 (e). <p>This provision is identical to the parallel provision in the
            FMIA, see supra, at 529, except that the FDCA mandates rather than allows the
            promulgation of implementing regulations.<span class="sup">[23]</span> The regulation
            issued in response to this statutory mandate is also substantially identical to its
            counterpart under the FMIA:</p> "The declaration of net quantity of contents shall
         express an accurate statement of the quantity of contents of the package. Reasonable
         variations caused by loss or gain of moisture during the course of good distribution
         practice or by unavoidable deviations in good manufacturing practice will be recognized.
         Variations from stated quantity of contents shall not be unreasonably large." 21 CFR § 1.8b
         (q) (1976). <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*534</span> Since flour is a food under the FDCA, its
            manufacture is also subject to the provisions of the FPLA. See 15 U. S. C. §§ 1452, 1459
            (a). That statute states a congressional policy that "[p]ackages and their labels should
            enable consumers to obtain accurate information as to the quantity of the contents and
            should facilitate value comparisons." § 1451. To accomplish those goals, insofar as is
            relevant here, the FPLA bans the distribution in commerce of any packaged commodity
            unless it complies with regulations</p> "which shall provide that&#x97; <p/>
         <h2>.....</h2> "(2) The net quantity of contents (in terms of weight, measure, or numerical
         count) shall be separately and accurately stated in a uniform location upon the principal
         display panel of [the required] label." § 1453 (a). <p>The FPLA also contains a saving
            clause which specifies that nothing in the FPLA "shall be construed to repeal,
            invalidate, or supersede" the FDCA. § 1460. Nothing in the FPLA explicitly permits any
            variation between stated weight and actual weight.</p>
         <p>The amici States contend that since the FPLA does not allow any variations from stated
            weight, there is no difference between federal law governing labeling of flour and
            California law. The Court of Appeals, however, held that because of the saving clause,
            compliance with the FDCA, which does allow reasonable variations, satisfies the
            requirements of the FPLA. 530 F. 2d, at 1325. Amici respond that the Court of Appeals
            misinterpreted the FDCA and that the FDCA establishes a statutory standard of strict
            accuracy for net-weight labeling. They argue, therefore, that the saving clause of the
            FPLA does not alter the standard mandated by § 1453. Brief for 39 States as Amici Curiae
            15-21. Alternatively, the States argue that although the saving clause means that the
            FPLA does not supersede the FDCA, "it <span class="star-pagination">*535</span> cannot
            be construed to excuse compliance with FPLA standards where both FDCA and FPLA
            requirements are applicable." Id., at 28.</p>
         <p>The States' argument that the FDCA standard makes no allowance for reasonable variations
            is based on this Court's opinion in United States v. Shreveport Grain &amp;amp; Elevator
            Co., 287 U. S. 77 (1932). Shreveport decided an appeal by the Government in a criminal
            case involving shortweighting in violation of the predecessor of the FDCA, the Food and
            Drugs Act, 34 Stat. 768, as amended, c. 117, 37 Stat. 732. The trial court had dismissed
            the indictment under that statute, which was essentially identical to the net-weight
            labeling requirement of the FDCA,<span class="sup">[24]</span> on the ground that the
            prohibition of unreasonable variations from the marked weight was too indefinite to
            state a criminal offense. We reversed, holding that the statute's substantive standard
            was created by the "accurate statement" language which preceded the proviso allowing
            reasonable variations, and that the proviso merely granted administrative authority to
            promulgate regulations permitting variations "from the hard and fast rule of the act."
            287 U. S., at 81-82. Since Congress re-enacted the language interpreted by the
            Shreveport Court, FDCA, c. 675, § 403 (e), 52 Stat. 1047, amici conclude that the
            standard under the FDCA is also a "hard and fast rule."</p>
         <p>We need not decide whether the rationale as well as the <span class="star-pagination"
               >*536</span> result of Shreveport remains good law.<span class="sup">[25]</span> It
            is clear that 21 CFR § 1.8b (q) (1976), insofar as it is based on the FDCA, has the
            force of law<span class="sup">[26]</span> and allows reasonable variations. Thus,
            whether the statutory standard is viewed as strict, with the regulation considered a
            restriction on the power to prosecute, or whether the standard is itself viewed as
            incorporating the flexibility of the proviso and its implementing regulation,<span
               class="sup">[27]</span> the result is the same. Under the FDCA, reasonable variations
            from the stated net weight do not subject a miller to prosecution, whether civil or
            criminal, if the variations arise from the permitted causes. The question raised by the
            arguments of amici is whether by enacting the FPLA, Congress intended to eliminate the
            area of freedom from prosecution created by the FDCA and its implementing
            regulation.</p>
         <p>Over 60 years ago, Congress concluded that variations must be allowed because of the
            nature of certain foods and the impossibility of developing completely accurate means of
            packing. H. R. Rep. No. 850, 62d Cong., 2d Sess., 2 <span class="star-pagination"
               >*537</span> (1912); S. Rep. No. 1216, 62d Cong., 3d Sess., 2-3 (1913).<span
               class="sup">[28]</span> Since 1914, regulations under the food and drug laws have
            permitted reasonable variations from stated net weight resulting from packing deviations
            or gain or loss of moisture occurring despite good commercial practice. See United
            States v. Shreveport Grain &amp;amp; Elevator Co., supra, at 84. If Congress had
            intended to overrule this longstanding administrative practice, founded on a legislative
            statement of necessity, we would expect it to have done so clearly. Instead, it
            explicitly preserved existing law, with "no changes." 15 U. S. C. § 1460; S. Rep. No.
            1186, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 20 (1966). The legislative history of the FPLA contains some
            indication that the saving clause was understood to preserve the reasonable-variation
            regulation under the FDCA,<span class="sup">[29]</span> and no evidence that Congress
            affirmatively intended to overrule that regulation.<span class="sup">[30]</span> We can
            only conclude that under the FPLA, as under the FDCA, a manufacturer of food is not
               <span class="star-pagination">*538</span> subject to enforcement action for violation
            of the net-weight labeling requirements if the label accurately states the net weight,
            with allowance for the specified reasonable variations.</p>
         <p>B. The FDCA contains no pre-emptive language. The FPLA, on the other hand, declares
            that</p> "it is the express intent of Congress to supersede any and all laws of the
         States or political subdivisions thereof insofar as they may now or hereafter provide for
         the labeling of the net qua[nt]ity of contents of the package of any consumer commodity
         covered by this chapter which are less stringent than or require information different from
         the requirements of section 1453 of this title or regulations promulgated pursuant
         thereto." 15 U. S. C. § 1461.<span class="sup">[31]</span>
         <p>The Court of Appeals, although recognizing that this section leaves more scope for state
            law than does the FMIA, concluded that § 12211, as implemented by Art. 5, is pre-empted
            because it is less stringent than the Federal Acts, 530 F. 2d, at 1324-1327.</p>
         <p>The basis for the Court of Appeals' holding is unclear. Its opinion may be read as based
            on the conclusion that the state law is inadequate because its enforcement relies on a
            statistical averaging procedure. We have rejected that conclusion. See supra, at 531,
            and n. 18. Alternatively, the Court of Appeals may have found California's approach less
            stringent because the State takes no enforcement action against lots whose <span
               class="star-pagination">*539</span> average net weight exceeds the weight stated on
            the label, even if that excess is not a reasonable variation attributable to a federally
            allowed cause.</p>
         <p>We have some doubt that by pre-empting less stringent state laws, Congress intended to
            compel the States to expend scarce enforcement resources to prevent the sale of packages
            which contain more than the stated net weight. We do not have to reach that question,
            however, because in this respect California law apparently differs not at all from
            federal law, as applied. The inspectors responsible for enforcing the net-weight
            labeling provisions of the Federal Acts are officially informed that "[f]ield weighing
            for net weight is primarily to determine the likelihood of short weight units in the
            lots." Moreover, they are not required to submit samples to headquarters "if the average
            net is not below the amount declared on the label." Food and Drug Administration,
            Inspection Operations Manual 448.1, 448.13 (1976). These instructions undercut the
            argument that there is a federal interest in preventing packages from being
               overfilled.<span class="sup">[32]</span> Since neither jurisdiction is concerned with
            overweighting in the administration of its weights and measures laws, we cannot say that
            California's statutory lack of concern for that "problem"<span class="sup">[33]</span>
            makes its laws less stringent than the federal.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*540</span> Respondents argue that California's law is
            pre-empted because it requires information different from that required by federal law.
            The meaning of the statutory pre-emption of laws that require "information different
            from" the federal net-weight labeling provisions, like the meaning of the phrase "less
            stringent," is unclear. Respondents attribute to the ban on requiring different
            information a broad meaning, similar in scope to the pre-emption provision of the FMIA.
            They contend that since California law requires the label to state the minimum net
            weight, it requires "information different from" the federal laws, which demand an
            accurate statement with allowance for the specified reasonable variations. Brief for
            Respondents 31-32. The legislative history, however, suggests that the statute expressly
            pre-empts as requiring "different information" only state laws governing net quantity
            labeling which impose requirements inconsistent with those imposed by federal law.<span
               class="sup">[34]</span> Since it would be possible to comply with the state law
            without triggering federal enforcement action we conclude that the state requirement is
            not inconsistent with federal law. We therefore hold that 15 U. S. C. § 1461 does not
            pre-empt California's § 12211 as implemented by Art. 5.</p>
         <p>That holding does not, however, resolve this case, for we still must determine whether
            the state law "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full
               <span class="star-pagination">*541</span> purposes and objectives of Congress." See
            supra, at 526. As Congress clearly stated, a major purpose of the FPLA is to facilitate
            value comparisons among similar products. Obviously, this goal cannot be accomplished
            unless packages that bear the same indicated weight in fact contain the same quantity of
            the product for which the consumer is paying. The significance of this requirement for
            our purposes results from the physical attributes of flour.</p>
         <p>Flour is composed of flour solids and moisture. The average water content of wheat
            kernels used to make flour is 12.5% by weight, with a range from 10% to 14.5%. Efficient
            milling practice requires adding water to raise the moisture content to 15% to 16%; if
            the wheat is too wet or too dry, milling will be hindered. During milling, the moisture
            content is reduced to 13% to 14%. App. 28-29.<span class="sup">[35]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The moisture content of flour does not remain constant after milling is completed. If
            the relative humidity of the atmosphere in which it is stored is greater than 60%, flour
            will gain moisture, and if the humidity is less than 60%, it will lose moisture.<span
               class="sup">[36]</span> The federal net-weight labeling standard permits variations
            from stated weight caused by this gain or loss of moisture.</p>
         <p>Packages that meet the federal labeling requirements<span class="sup">[37]</span>
            <span class="star-pagination">*542</span> and that have the same stated quantity of
            contents can be expected to contain the same amount of flour solids.<span class="sup"
               >[38]</span> Manufacturers will produce flour with a moisture content fixed by the
            requirements of the milling process.<span class="sup">[39]</span> Since manufacturers
            have reason not to pack significantly more than is required and federal law prohibits
            underpacking, they will pack the same amount of this similarly composed flour into
            packages of any given size.<span class="sup">[40]</span> Despite any changes in weight
            resulting from changes in moisture content during distribution, the packages will
            contain the same amount of flour solids when they reach the consumer. This identity of
            contents facilitates consumer value comparisons.</p>
         <p>The State's refusal to permit reasonable weight variations resulting from loss of
            moisture during distribution produces a different effect.<span class="sup">[41]</span>
            In order to be certain of meeting the California standard, a miller must ensure that
            loss of moisture during distribution will not bring the weight of the contents below the
            stated weight. Local millers, which serve a limited area, could do so by adjusting their
            packing practices to the specific humidity conditions of their region. For example, a
            miller in an area where the humidity is typically higher than <span
               class="star-pagination">*543</span> 60% would not need to overpack at all. By
            contrast, a miller with a national marketing area would not know the destination of its
            flour when it was packaged and would therefore have to assume that the flour would lose
            weight during distribution. The national manufacturer, therefore, would have to
            overpack.</p>
         <p>Similarly, manufacturers who distributed only in States that followed the federal
            standard would not be concerned with compensating for possible moisture loss during
            distribution. National manufacturers who did not exclude the nonconforming States from
            their marketing area, on the other hand, would have to overpack. Thus, as a result of
            the application of the California standard, consumers throughout the country who
            attempted to compare the value of identically labeled packages of flour would not be
            comparing packages which contained identical amounts of flour solids. Value comparisons
            which did not account for this difference&#x97;and there would be no way for the
            consumer to make the necessary calculations&#x97;would be misleading.</p>
         <p>We therefore conclude that with respect to the millers' flour, enforcement of § 12211,
            as implemented by Art. 5, would prevent "the accomplishment and execution of the full
            purposes and objectives of Congress" in passing the FPLA. Under the Constitution, that
            result is impermissible, and the state law must yield to the federal.</p>
         <p>The judgments are affirmed.</p>
         <p>It is so ordered.</p></div>
      <div type="concurrence" judge="rehnquist">
         <p>MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART joins, concurring in part and
            dissenting in part.</p>
         <p>I agree that with respect to Rath's packaged bacon, § 12211 of the Cal. Bus. &amp;amp;
            Prof. Code and Art. 5 of 4 Cal. Admin. Code, c. 8, are pre-empted by the express
            pre-emptive provision of the Federal Meat Inspection Act, 21 U. S. C. § 678. I also
            agree that with respect to General Mills' flour, § 12211 <span class="star-pagination"
               >*544</span> and Art. 5 are not pre-empted by the express pre-emptive provision of
            the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA), 15 U. S. C. § 1461. I am unable to agree,
            however, with the implicit pre-emption the Court finds with respect to the flour. This
            latter pre-emption is founded in unwarranted speculations that hardly rise to that clear
            demonstration of conflict that must exist before the mere existence of a federal law may
            be said to pre-empt state law operating in the same field.</p>
         <p>With respect to labeling requirements for flour under the scheme contemplated by the
            FPLA in conjunction with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Court determines
            that the state-law labeling requirements are neither "less stringent than" nor
            inconsistent with those federal requirements. This conclusion quite properly dictates
            the Court's holding that Congress has not expressly prohibited state regulation in this
            field. The remaining inquiry, then, is whether the two statutory schemes are in utter
               conflict.<span class="sup">[1]</span> As this Court noted in Kelly v. Washington, 302
            U. S. 1, 10 (1937):</p> "The principle is thoroughly established that the exercise by
         the State of its police power, which would be valid if not superseded by federal action, is
         superseded only where the repugnance or conflict is so `direct and positive' that the two
         acts cannot `be reconciled or consistently stand together.' " <p>See also Cloverleaf Butter
            Co. v. Patterson, 315 U. S. 148, 156 (1942); Askew v. American Waterways Operators,
            Inc., 411 U. S. 325, 337, 341 (1973). When we deal, as we do here, with congressional
            action "in a field which the States have traditionally occupied," the basic assumption
            from which pre-emption <span class="star-pagination">*545</span> must be viewed is "that
            the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act
            unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress." Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator
            Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947); cf. De Canas v. Bica, 424 U. S. 351, 356 (1976). I am
            simply unable to find that this stringent standard has been met in this case.</p>
         <p>The Court's opinion demonstrates that it is physically possible to comply with the
            state-law requirement "without triggering federal enforcement action," ante, at 540.
            This leads the Court to conclude that the "state requirement is not inconsistent with
            federal law." Ibid. It also must lead to the conclusion that this is not a case "where
            compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility for one
            engaged in interstate commerce." Florida Lime &amp;amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul,
            373 U. S. 132, 142-143 (1963). Pre-emption, then, if it is to exist at all in this case,
            must exist because the operation of the state Act inexorably conflicts with the purposes
            underlying the Federal Act. The Court relies on the fact that one of the purposes of the
            FPLA is to "facilitate value comparisons" among consumers, 15 U. S. C. § 1451. But
            merely identifying a purpose is not enough; it must also be shown that the state law
            inevitably frustrates that purpose. As we but recently noted:</p> "We must also be
         careful to distinguish those situations in which the concurrent exercise of a power by the
         Federal Government and the States or by the States alone may possibly lead to conflicts and
         those situations where conflicts will necessarily arise. `It is not . . . a mere
         possibility of inconvenience in the exercise of powers, but an immediate constitutional
         repugnancy that can by implication alienate and extinguish a pre-existing right of [state]
         sovereignty.' The <ref type="" num="32">Federalist</ref> No. 32, p. 243 (B. Wright ed. 1961)." Goldstein v. California,
         412 U. S. 546, 554-555 (1973) (emphasis in original). <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*546</span> Under the proper test, it is only</p> "[i]f
         the purpose of the act cannot otherwise be accomplished &#x97;if its operation within its
         chosen field else must be frustrated and its provisions be refused their natural
         effect&#x97;the state law must yield to the regulation of Congress within the sphere of its
         delegated power." Savage v. Jones, 225 U. S. 501, 533 (1912). <p>The Court's reliance on
            supposition and inference fails in two respects to demonstrate that respondents have
            carried their burden of demonstrating pre-emption. First, on the Court's own premises,
            there should be no finding of pre-emption. We are told, ante, at 526, that the relevant
            inquiry is "the relationship between state and federal laws as they are interpreted and
            applied, not merely as they are written," while we are further told, ante, at 539, that
            there is, in fact, no "federal interest in preventing packages from being overfilled,"
            since the Federal Government is not "concerned with overweighting in the administration
            of its weights and measures laws . . . ." Under these premises, it is hard to accept the
            Court's conclusion that, because of the federal purpose to facilitate consumer value
               comparisons,<span class="sup">[2]</span> the state law is pre-empted because some
            packages might contain more than the minimum weight stated and more than another
            company's similarly marked package. For, we have been told that, should a manufacturer
            deliberately overpack, for whatever reason,<span class="sup">[3]</span> there will be no
            federal action taken against him even though value comparisons might then "be
            misleading." It is virtually impossible to say, as the Court does, that "neither the
            State nor the Federal Government is concerned with over-weighting," <span
               class="star-pagination">*547</span> ante, at 542 n. 41, and yet conclude that
            state-induced overweighting conflicts with a "value comparison" purpose, while,
            presumably, other overweighting does not. In viewing such a purpose to be sufficient to
            require pre-emption while the very purpose is ignored in practice by the administering
            federal agency reverses the normal presumption against finding pre-emption. The
            reasoning process which leads the Court to conclude that there is no express
            pre-emption, ante, at 540, leads me to conclude that there is no implied
               pre-emption.<span class="sup">[4]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Second, and as troubling as the legal inconsistency, is the Court's reliance on unproved
            factual speculation in demonstrating the purported irreconcilable undermining of the
            federal purpose by the state statutory scheme. The premises the opinion must rely on are
            many. It acknowledges that flour packed under different humidity conditions would
            nonetheless comply with the federal standard, even though, as a result, similarly marked
            packages might contain different quantities of flour "solids," ante, at 542, and n. 39,
            but relies on the economics of the milling process to conclude that packers "will pack
            the same amount of [flour solids] into packages of any given size." This may normally be
            true as an economic fact, but it is not supported by the record and as a Court we have
            no way of knowing it from other sources.</p>
         <p>Similarly defective is the reasoning process by which the majority concludes that local
            millers could adjust their packaging practices to specific humidity conditions, while
            national millers could not, since the national millers "would not know the destination
            of [their] flour when it was packaged and would therefore have to assume that the flour
            would lose weight during distribution." Ante, at 543. This assumption <span
               class="star-pagination">*548</span> too, is unsupported by the record.<span
               class="sup">[5]</span> We simply have no basis for concluding that national
            distributors do not know, or could not know through the exertion of some modicum of
            effort, where their flour will end up. The possibility that a packer might have to incur
            some extra expense in meeting both systems simply does not mean that the "purposes of
            the act cannot otherwise be accomplished," Savage v. Jones, 225 U. S., at 533, nor does
            it demonstrate that "the two acts cannot `be reconciled . . . ,' " Kelly v. Washington,
            302 U. S., at 10.<span class="sup">[6]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*549</span> The assumptions in the Court's opinion not
            only are insufficient to compel a finding of implied pre-emption, they suggest an
            approach to the question of pre-emption wholly at odds with that enunciated in Florida
            Lime &amp;amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132 (1963). There, this Court
            was concerned with differing federal and state maturity standards for avocados grown in
            Florida. This Court rejected a test which looked to the similarity of purposes, id., at
            142, and noted instead that a manufacturer could have complied with both statutes by
            modifying procedures somewhat, id., at 143, which demonstrated that there was "no
            inevitable collision between the two schemes of regulation, despite the dissimilarity of
            the standards," ibid. Nothing has been shown to demonstrate that this conclusion is not

            </span>, 531 (CD Cal. 1973). The Director of Food and Agriculture of the State of
            California intervened as a defendant in the Becker proceeding. The millers filed a
            single action against Jones.</p>
         <p>[5] The District Court's opinion in Rath's suit is reported as Rath Packing Co. v.
            Becker, supra. The decision in the millers' action is not separately reported, but is
            reprinted as an appendix to the Court of Appeals' opinion. General Mills, Inc. v. Jones,
            530 F. 2d 1317, 1329-1330 (CA9 1975). </p>
         <p>Rath's argument that 21 U. S. C. § 607 (b) limits enforcement of the accuracy
            requirement to the time meat or meat food products leave the processing plant was
            rejected by the District Court, 357 F. Supp., at 532, as were the millers' contentions
            that California's inspection laws unreasonably burden interstate commerce and deny
            manufacturers due process of law. See General Mills, Inc. v. Jones, supra, at
            1322-1323.</p>
         <p>[6] Rath Packing Co. v. Becker, 530 F. 2d 1295 (CA9 1975); General Mills, Inc. v. Jones,
            supra. </p>
         <p>The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's holding that the governing federal
            regulations, 9 CFR § 317.2 (h) (2) (1976) and 21 CFR § 1.8b (q) (1976), are void for
            vagueness. Rath Packing Co. v. Becker, supra, at 1308-1312; General Mills, Inc. v.
            Jones, supra, at 1323-1324. The validity of the regulations is not at issue here.</p>
         <p>[7] Jones' single petition for certiorari sought review of the judgments in both Rath
            Packing Co. v. Becker, supra, and General Mills, Inc. v. Jones, supra. See this Court's
            Rule 23 (5). No action has been taken on the separate petition for certiorari filed by
            California's Director of Food and Agriculture, see n. 4, supra, and Becker. Wallace v.
            Rath Packing Co., cert. pending, No. 75-1052.</p>
         <p>[8] The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's holding, see n. 5, supra, that
            the California provisions violate neither the Commerce Clause nor the Fourteenth
            Amendment. 530 F. 2d, at 1322-1323. The millers do not challenge these holdings
            here.</p>
         <p>[9] The District Court concluded that the Art. 5 "procedure is a statistical
            determination based upon normal and proven statistical standards." 357 F. Supp., at 533.
            The statistical validity of the procedure has not been challenged.</p>
         <p>[10] "Tare" is the weight of the packing material in which the product is contained. In
            order to determine the tare, the inspector weighs each package and then removes and
            weighs the contents of each package. By subtracting the net weight from the gross
            weight, he obtains the tare. </p>
         <p>After it is packed, bacon loses moisture. Some of that moisture is absorbed by the
            insert on which the bacon is placed. A wax board insert will absorb approximately 5/16
            of an ounce from the product, whereas a polyethylene insert will absorb approximately
            1/16 of an ounce. App. 88-90, 94; 530 F. 2d, at 1299 n. 2. In addition, moisture is lost
            to the atmosphere or, in a hermetically sealed package, by condensation onto the packing
            material. App. 61. California's inspectors include in the weight of the material any
            moisture or grease which the bacon has lost to it. Federal inspectors at the packing
            plant, by contrast, determine the tare by weighing the packing material dry. 530 F. 2d,
            at 1299. It is not feasible for field inspectors to use a dry tare method. C.

            Commodities&#x97;Revision of National Bureau of Standards Handbook 67, p. 33 (July 1975
            Draft).</p>
         <p>After noting this difference, the Court of Appeals stated: "The difference in tares
            employed is not an issue in this case." 530 F. 2d, at 1299 n. 4. Respondents have,
            nevertheless, suggested that the divergence in results produced by the two techniques
            requires federal pre-emption, Brief for Respondents 18-19, 37; Tr. of Oral Arg. 43-44.
            We consider the difference significant only insofar as it is an aspect of the State's
            failure to allow variations from stated weight resulting from loss of moisture during
            good distribution practice. See infra, at 531-532.</p>
         <p>[11] "The individual unreasonable errors, both plus and minus, are excluded from the
            average, because they are acted upon individually and because their inclusion could
            destroy or alter the packaging pattern. For instance: A sample of ten (10) packages
            could show nine (9) packages each with a minus error of 1, and one package with a plus
            error of 9. If the large plus error is included, the total error is 0. Obviously, the
            pattern of the sample is a minus 1 per package." 4 Cal. Admin. Code § 2933.3.11 (1961). </p>
         <p>Enforcement action is taken against packages with unreasonably large minus errors. §
            2933.3.12 (c) (1970).</p>
         <p>[12] If the result of the sampling is not conclusive, additional samples may be drawn.
            §§ 2933.3.12 (a), (b) (1961).</p>
         <p>[13] Rath's procedures for assuring that its bacon packages contain the stated net
            weight have been submitted to the Department of Agriculture for approval. 530 F. 2d, at
            1298; Brief for Respondents 9. When an approved plan is in effect, the federal inspector
            reviews records and observes procedures to assure compliance with the plan. The
            inspector is also required to sample one subgroup at least twice a week and to check the
            weight of a production lot at least once a week. U. S. Department of Agriculture, Meat
            and Poultry Inspection Manual § 18.61 (b) (1) (i) (1973). When no approved plan is in
            effect, the inspector samples at least 10 lots each week, unless production volume is
            low. Id., at 18.61 (b) (2).</p>
         <p>[14] See 530 F. 2d, at 1299.</p>
         <p>[15] 21 U. S. C. §§ 607 (d), 610 (b).</p>
         <p>[16] Both sources of variation from stated weight are relevant to bacon. Bacon loses
            moisture to its wrapping materials and to the atmosphere. See n. 10, supra. The rate of
            loss to the atmosphere in a typical retail showcase is 0.3/16 to 0.4/16 of an ounce per
            day. App. 95. In addition, since bacon is cut in discrete slices, it is impossible to
            guarantee that each package will contain exactly the stated weight when packed. Instead
            of seeking exactitude, Rath approved packages if they were within 5/16 of an ounce of a
            target weight. Prior to petitioner's enforcement activities, and the similar activities
            of Becker, see n. 4, supra, Rath's target weight was 3/16 of an ounce over the stated
            weight, or 1 lb. 3/16 oz. for a one-pound package. Thus, a package would be passed if it
            weighed between 15 14/16 oz. and 1 lb. 8/16 oz. In response to the California
            enforcement measures, Rath raised its target weight to 8/16 oz. over stated net weight
            for bacon packed on a polyethylene insert, and 12/16 oz. over stated weight for bacon
            packed on wax boards. App. 86-89.</p>
         <p>[17] Section 408, 81 Stat. 600, states in full: </p>
         <p>"Requirements within the scope of this Act with respect to premises, facilities and
            operations of any establishment at which inspection is provided under title I of this
            Act, which are in addition to, or different than those made under this Act may not be
            imposed by any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, except that any such
            jurisdiction may impose recordkeeping and other requirements within the scope of section
            202 of this Act if consistent therewith, with respect to any such establishment.
            Marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirements in addition to, or different
            than, those made under this Act may not be imposed by any State or Territory or the
            District of Columbia with respect to articles prepared at any establishment under
            inspection in accordance with the requirements under title I of this Act, but any State
            or Territory or the District of Columbia may, consistent with the requirements under

            food purposes of any such articles which are adulterated or misbranded and are outside
            of such an establishment, or, in the case of imported articles which are not at such an
            establishment, after their entry into the United States. This Act shall not preclude any
            State or Territory or the District of Columbia from making requirement or taking other
            action, consistent with this Act, with respect to any other matters regulated under this
            Act."</p>
         <p>[18] The implicit recognition of manufacturing variations results from California's use
            of the statistically estimated average weight of the lot to determine whether the label
            accurately indicates the contents. By averaging the weight of the packages in the
            sample, California allows individual deviations around the packer's target weight to
            cancel each other out. The average weight of the sample should equal the target weight,
            see n. 16, supra, with allowance for sampling variation and moisture loss. Article 5
            utilizes tables which recognize sampling variation, but it makes no allowance for
            moisture loss. </p>
         <p>The Department of Agriculture itself uses statistical sampling techniques, including
            reliance on average lot weight to account for manufacturing deviations. See Meat and
            Poultry Inspection Manual, supra, n. 13, at § 18.61 (b) (2); Brief for United States as
            Amicus Curiae 7 n. 4. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine any other practical technique
            for policing net-weight labeling requirements in a country where over 200 billion
            packages are produced every year. See Brickenhamp, Hasko, &amp;amp; Natrella, supra, n.
            10, at 78. We have found no indication that Congress intended simultaneously to grant
            concurrent jurisdiction to the States to enforce net-weight labeling requirements, see
            n. 17, supra, and to deny them the only practical tool with which to do so. Accordingly,
            we disagree with anything in the opinions below that suggests that States may not use
            valid statistical sampling techniques, including reliance on lot average weights, to
            police compliance with federal and valid state net-weight labeling laws.</p>
         <p>[19] Moisture loss during distribution will, obviously, cause the net weight of bacon to
            be less than it was when the bacon left the packing plant. An averaging procedure, in
            which deviations above the average cancel deviations below the average, does not make
            any allowance for moisture loss during good distribution practice, which works in only
            one direction.</p>
         <p>[20] Brief for Petitioner 40. See also Brief for 39 States as Amici Curiae 56-58.</p>
         <p>[21] "The term `labeling' means all labels and other written, printed, or graphic matter
            (1) upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers, or (2) accompanying such
            article." § 1 (p), 81 Stat. 587.</p>
         <p>[22] Flour is a food within the coverage of the Act. See 21 U. S. C. § 321 (f).</p>
         <p>[23] The definition of "misbranded" in the FMIA is based on the definition in the FDCA.
            See S. Rep. No. 799, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 7 (1967).</p>
         <p>[24] The statute construed in Shreveport provided that a food would be considered
            misbranded&#x97; </p>
         <p>"If in package form, the quantity of the contents be not plainly and conspicuously
            marked on the outside of the package in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count:
            Provided, however, That reasonable variations shall be permitted, and tolerances and
            also exemptions as to small packages shall be established by rules and regulations made
            in accordance with the provisions of Section three of this Act." 287 U. S., at 81.</p>
         <p>[25] We have subsequently cited Shreveport as an example of a case where a criminal
            statute has been found not impermissibly vague although it did not provide an
            unmistakably clear line between prohibited and permitted conduct. Jordan v. De George,
            341 U. S. 223, 231 n. 15 (1951); Gorin v. United States, 312 U. S. 19, 27 n. 13
            (1941).</p>
         <p>[26] United States v. Mersky, 361 U. S. 431, 437-438 (1960); Atchison, T. &amp;amp; S.
            F. R. Co. v. Scarlett, 300 U. S. 471, 474 (1937).</p>
         <p>[27] This view, although contrary to the Court's analysis in Shreveport, is strongly
            supported by the legislative history of the statutory provision for reasonable
            variations. As originally passed, the Food and Drugs Act did not require packages to
            bear a statement of net weight, but it did require that any statement of weight be plain
            and correct. § 8, 34 Stat. 771. In 1913 Congress changed the law by requiring that
            labels state the quantity of contents, and at the same time it added the recognition of
            reasonable variations. C. 117, 37 Stat. 732. Both the House and Senate committee reports
            stated that "[u]nder the terms of the bill reasonable variations are permitted, whether
            tolerances are or are not established by the rules and regulations . . . ." H. R. Rep.
            No. 850, 62d Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1912); S. Rep. No. 1216, 62d Cong., 3d Sess., 3
            (1913).</p>
         <p>[28] The language of the two committee reports is identical: </p>
         <p>"It being apparent to everyone that it is impossible to make packages of exactly the
            same size or to pack them with exactly the same quantity of contents, and it being also
            apparent that the exact weight and measure of the contents of a package may undergo
            slight changes from natural causes, it is also apparent that legislation requiring
            similar packages to contain the same exact quantity in terms of weight or measure,
            without allowing for any variation, would be destructive and prevent the putting of
            foods in packages." H. R. Rep. No. 850, supra, at 2; S. Rep. No. 1216, supra, at
            2-3.</p>
         <p>[29] See Hearings on Fair Packaging and Labeling before the House Committee on
            Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 208 (1966).</p>
         <p>[30] It is clear from reading the legislative history that Congress did not intend to
            alter the FDCA's standard of accuracy when it passed the FPLA's requirement that a
            separate and accurate statement of net quantity appear in a uniform location on package
            labels, 15 U. S. C. § 1453 (a) (2). See, e. g., H. R. Rep. No. 2076, 89th Cong., 2d
            Sess., 20 (1966) (chart indicating that only change from FDCA effected by provision
            which became § 1453 is imposition of location requirement).</p>
         <p>[31] Since we have held that 15 U. S. C. § 1453, read in conjunction with § 1460 and the
            FDCA, permits reasonable variations, we conclude that 21 CFR § 1.8b (q) (1976) properly
            relies on § 1453 as authority for its promulgation. Thus, § 1461 pre-empts state laws
            which "are less stringent than or require information different from" § 1.8b (q). We
            need not consider respondents' contention, Brief for Respondents 30, that § 1.8b (q) is
            authorized by 15 U. S. C. § 1454 (b), nor need we decide whether § 1461 would affect
            state laws less stringent than or different from regulations authorized by § 1454.</p>
         <p>[32] Overweight packages are apparently also of no concern in the administration of the
            FMIA. See Meat and Poultry Inspection Manual, supra, n. 13, at 168-174. At oral
            argument, counsel for respondents was unable to cite any examples of federal enforcement
            action against overweight packages. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 49-50. To support his argument
            that federal law forbids overweighting, counsel relied on the argument made by the
            United States as amicus curiae in this litigation. The Government's brief in this Court
            also cites no examples of enforcement action based on overweighting and, although it
            refers generally to the inspection manuals cited here and in text, the brief makes no
            mention of the provisions to which we refer.</p>
         <p>[33] The economic self-interest of packers is likely to prevent avoidable
            overpacking.</p>
         <p>[34] The language of 15 U. S. C. § 1461 was contained in the House bill. The Senate
            bill, by contrast, provided for pre-emption of state requirements which "differ from"
            those in the FPLA. S. Rep. No. 1186, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 38 (1966). The language
            accepted by the House was adopted by the conference committee, along with the House
            committee's explanation that </p>
         <p>"preemption would take place to the extent that `State laws or State regulations with
            respect to the labeling of net quantity of contents of packages impose inconsistent or
            less stringent requirements than are imposed under section 4 of this legislation.' " H.
            R. Rep. No. 2286, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 11 (1966).</p>
         <p>[35] The maximum allowable moisture content for any product labeled "flour" is 15%. 21
            CFR § 15.1 (1976).</p>
         <p>[36] App. 32-35. Weight fluctuations of 3% to 4% resulting from changes in moisture
            content are not uncommon during good distribution practice within the continental United
            States. Id., at 32-33. The flour produced by respondent General Mills and ordered off
            the market by petitioner weighed, on the average, between 0.125% and 1.25% less than the
            stated weights. Id., at 36. </p>
         <p>If flour were packed in airtight packages in order to prevent weight fluctuations
            resulting from changes in moisture content, it would spoil. Tr. of Oral Arg. 39.</p>
         <p>[37] It is undisputed that the packages of flour ordered off the market by petitioner
            complied with federal standards when packed. 530 F. 2d, at 1320; App. 36-37.</p>
         <p>[38] The nutritional value of a quantity of flour is determined by the amount of flour
            solids it contains. Id., at 35.</p>
         <p>[39] Although federal law would allow moisture content to be higher than that required
            by the milling process, see n. 35, supra, flour of the type involved in this case is not
            produced with moisture content as high as the law would permit. App. 30. Since
            manufacturers would have an economic incentive to produce flour with as close to the
            allowable maximum moisture content as milling technique permits, one would expect all
            flour to have virtually the same moisture content when packed.</p>
         <p>[40] Unavoidable deviations resulting from the packing process will, of course, cause
            differences in the contents of individual packages. On the average, however, one would
            expect packages of a given size to contain the same amount.</p>
         <p>[41] Since neither the State nor the Federal Government is concerned with overweighting,
            the absence of a state provision parallel to the federal recognition of weight gain from
            moisture is of no consequence.</p>
         <p>[1] There is no contention that the subject of the regulation is in its "nature
            national, or admit[ting] only of one uniform system . . . ." Cooley v. Board of Wardens,
               <span class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">12</span>
               <span class="reporter">How.</span>
               <span class="page">299</span>
            </span>, 319 (1852). On the contrary, "the supervision of the readying of foodstuffs for
            market has always been deemed a matter of peculiarly local concern." Florida Avocado
            Growers v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132, 144 (1963).</p>
         <p>[2] This purpose is not the only purpose underlying the Federal Act. Title 15 U. S. C. §
            1451 also announces the congressional policy of labeling packages so as to "enable
            consumers to obtain accurate information as to the quantity of the contents . . . ."</p>
         <p>[3] Including, one would have supposed, state compulsion.</p>
         <p>[4] The majority nowhere explains why its conclusion that the "state requirement is not
            inconsistent with federal law," ante, at 540, does not reflect on the fact that the
            state statutory scheme does not inevitably conflict with the federal.</p>
         <p>[5] The Court's reliance on the possible differential effect of California's
            requirements on local and national millers is itself wholly speculative. To begin with,
            we do not know from the record that there are both "local" and "national" millers,
            however defined. Even if both exist, we simply do not know that local millers will ship
            flour only to areas with comparable humidity levels. Any miller might experience a
            variety of humidity conditions by shipping to two different areas, despite the fact that
            his operation may be considered local in that the two areas are relatively contiguous.
            Even in the same town, stores that are air-conditioned may have significantly different
            humidity conditions than exist elsewhere in the town. In such situations, the local
            millers would have to adjust their packing process to account for this differential,
            either by packing different quantities into different packages, and then tracing their
            distribution, or by overpacking all packages sufficiently to ensure that any possible
            humidity conditions could be met. The same would appear to be true for national millers.
            We simply, then, do not know that local millers and national millers would not be
            similarly affected. The Court's assertions to the contrary are nothing but
            speculations.</p>
         <p>[6] For all that appears, packers could easily adjust their processes so as to insure
            compliance with the purposes of both Acts. Even if such adjustment should entail a minor
            economic inconvenience, it has nowhere been demonstrated that the imposition of a
            moderate economic burden conflicts with the purpose of the federal statutory scheme.
            California, in the exercise of its police powers, may be deemed to have believed that
            the benefits of its enactment outweigh these costs. Unless it can be shown that
            additional cost itself conflicts with a clear congressional purpose, the presumption is
            that our federal system of government tolerates such costs. And if added costs will
            vitiate the conflict, I do not see how it can be said that the statutory schemes
            necessarily conflict rather than just "may possibly" conflict. Goldstein v. California,
            412 U. S. 546, 554 (1973).</p>
         <p>[7] On its face, there is nothing inexorable about a conflict between a statute which,
            in effect, imposes a minimum weight requirement, and one whose purpose is to "enable
            consumers to obtain accurate information as to the quantity of the contents and [to]
            facilitate value comparisons." 15 U. S. C. § 1451.</p>
