         <p>JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
         <p>This is a case about federalism. It concerns the respect that federal courts owe the
            States and the States' procedural rules when reviewing the claims of state prisoners in
            federal habeas corpus.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>A Buchanan County, Virginia, jury convicted Roger Keith Coleman of rape and capital
            murder and fixed the sentence at <span class="star-pagination">*727</span> death for the
            murder. The trial court imposed the death sentence, and the Virginia Supreme Court
            affirmed both the convictions and the sentence. Coleman v. Commonwealth, <span
               class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">226</span>

            </span>, 307 S. E. 2d 864 (1983). This Court denied certiorari. 465 U. S. 1109
            (1984).</p>
         <p>Coleman then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Circuit Court for
            Buchanan County, raising numerous federal constitutional claims that he had not raised
            on direct appeal. After a 2-day evidentiary hearing, the Circuit Court ruled against
            Coleman on all claims. App. 3-19. The court entered its final judgment on September 4,
            1986.</p>
         <p>Coleman filed his notice of appeal with the Circuit Court on October 7, 1986, 33 days
            after the entry of final judgment. Coleman subsequently filed a petition for appeal in
            the Virginia Supreme Court. The Commonwealth of Virginia, as appellee, filed a motion to
            dismiss the appeal. The sole ground for dismissal urged in the motion was that Coleman's
            notice of appeal had been filed late. Virginia Supreme Court Rule 5:9(a) provides that
            no appeal shall be allowed unless a notice of appeal is filed with the trial court
            within 30 days of final judgment.</p>
         <p>The Virginia Supreme Court did not act immediately on the Commonwealth's motion, and
            both parties filed several briefs on the subject of the motion to dismiss and on the
            merits of the claims in Coleman's petition. On May 19, 1987, the Virginia Supreme Court
            issued the following order, dismissing Coleman's appeal:</p> "On December 4, 1986 came
         the appellant, by counsel, and filed a petition for appeal in the above-styled case.
         "Thereupon came the appellee, by the Attorney General of Virginia, and filed a motion to
         dismiss the petition for appeal; on December 19, 1986 the appellant filed a memorandum in
         opposition to the motion to dismiss; on December 19, 1986 the appellee filed a reply to the
         appellant's memorandum; on December 23, 1986 the appellee <span class="star-pagination"
            >*728</span> filed a brief in opposition to the petition for appeal; on December 23,
         1986 the appellant filed a surreply in opposition to the appellee's motion to dismiss; and
         on January 6, 1987 the appellant filed a reply brief. "Upon consideration whereof, the
         motion to dismiss is granted and the petition for appeal is dismissed." App. 25-26. <p>This
            Court again denied certiorari. Coleman v. Bass, 484 U. S. 918 (1987).</p>
         <p>Coleman next filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District
            Court for the Western District of Virginia. In his petition, Coleman presented four
            federal constitutional claims he had raised on direct appeal in the Virginia Supreme
            Court and seven claims he had raised for the first time in state habeas. The District
            Court concluded that, by virtue of the dismissal of his appeal by the Virginia Supreme
            Court in state habeas, Coleman had procedurally defaulted the seven claims. App. 38-39.
            The District Court nonetheless went on to address the merits of all 11 of Coleman's
            claims. The court ruled against Coleman on all of the claims and denied the petition.
            Id., at 40-52.</p>
         <p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. 895 F. 2d 139
            (1990). The court held that Coleman had defaulted all of the claims that he had
            presented for the first time in state habeas. Coleman argued that the Virginia Supreme
            Court had not "clearly and expressly" stated that its decision in state habeas was based
            on a procedural default, and therefore the federal courts could not treat it as such
            under the rule of Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255 (1989). The Fourth Circuit disagreed. It
            concluded that the Virginia Supreme Court had met the "plain statement" requirement of
            Harris by granting a motion to dismiss that was based solely on procedural grounds. 895
            F. 2d, at 143. The Fourth Circuit held that the Virginia Supreme Court's decision <span
               class="star-pagination">*729</span> rested on independent and adequate state grounds
            and that Coleman had not shown cause to excuse the default. Id., at 143-144. As a
            consequence, federal review of the claims Coleman presented only in the state habeas
            proceeding was barred. Id., at 144. We granted certiorari, 498 U. S. 937 (1990), to
            resolve several issues concerning the relationship between state procedural defaults and
            federal habeas review, and now affirm.</p>

         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>This Court will not review a question of federal law decided by a state court if the
            decision of that court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal
            question and adequate to support the judgment. See, e. g., Fox Film Corp. v. Muller, 296
            U. S. 207, 210 (1935); Klinger v. Missouri, <span class="citation">

               </a>
            </span>, 263 (1872). This rule applies whether the state law ground is substantive or
            procedural. See, e. g., Fox Film, supra; Herndon v. Georgia, 295 U. S. 441 (1935). In
            the context of direct review of a state court judgment, the independent and adequate
            state ground doctrine is jurisdictional. Because this Court has no power to review a
            state law determination that is sufficient to support the judgment, resolution of any
            independent federal ground for the decision could not affect the judgment and would
            therefore be advisory. See Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117, 125-126 (1945) ("We are not
            permitted to render an advisory opinion, and if the same judgment would be rendered by
            the state court after we corrected its views of federal laws, our review could amount to
            nothing more than an advisory opinion").</p>
         <p>We have applied the independent and adequate state ground doctrine not only in our own
            review of state court judgments, but in deciding whether federal district courts should
            address the claims of state prisoners in habeas corpus actions. The doctrine applies to
            bar federal habeas when <span class="star-pagination">*730</span> a state court declined
            to address a prisoner's federal claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state
            procedural requirement. In these cases, the state judgment rests on independent and
            adequate state procedural grounds. See Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 81, 87 (1977);
            Ulster County Court v. Allen, 442 U. S. 140, 148 (1979). See generally Harris, supra, at
            262.</p>
         <p>The basis for application of the independent and adequate state ground doctrine in
            federal habeas is somewhat different than on direct review by this Court. When this
            Court reviews a state court decision on direct review pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1257, it
            is reviewing the judgment; if resolution of a federal question cannot affect the
            judgment, there is nothing for the Court to do. This is not the case in habeas. When a
            federal district court reviews a state prisoner's habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28
            U. S. C. § 2254, it must decide whether the petitioner is "in custody in violation of
            the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States." Ibid. The court does not
            review a judgment, but the lawfulness of the petitioner's custody simpliciter. See Fay
            v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 430 (1963).</p>
         <p>Nonetheless, a state prisoner is in custody pursuant to a judgment. When a federal
            habeas court releases a prisoner held pursuant to a state court judgment that rests on
            an independent and adequate state ground, it renders ineffective the state rule just as
            completely as if this Court had reversed the state judgment on direct review. See id.,
            at 469 (Harlan, J., dissenting). In such a case, the habeas court ignores the State's
            legitimate reasons for holding the prisoner.</p>
         <p>In the habeas context, the application of the independent and adequate state ground
            doctrine is grounded in concerns of comity and federalism. Without the rule, a federal
            district court would be able to do in habeas what this Court could not do on direct
            review; habeas would offer state prisoners whose custody was supported by independent
            and adequate <span class="star-pagination">*731</span> state grounds an end run around
            the limits of this Court's jurisdiction and a means to undermine the State's interest in
            enforcing its laws.</p>
         <p>When the independent and adequate state ground supporting a habeas petitioner's custody
            is a state procedural default, an additional concern comes into play. This Court has
            long held that a state prisoner's federal habeas petition should be dismissed if the
            prisoner has not exhausted available state remedies as to any of his federal claims. See
            Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241 (1886). See also Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509 (1982);
            Castille v. Peoples, 489 U. S. 346 (1989); 28 U. S. C. § 2254(b) (codifying the rule).
            This exhaustion requirement is also grounded in principles of comity; in a federal
            system, the States should have the first opportunity to address and correct alleged
            violations of state prisoner's federal rights. As we explained in Rose, supra:</p> "The
         exhaustion doctrine is principally designed to protect the state courts' role in the
         enforcement of federal law and prevent disruption of state judicial proceedings. See Braden
         v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky, 410 U. S. 484, 490-491 (1973). Under our
         federal system, the federal and state `courts [are] equally bound to gnard and protect
         rights secured by the Constitution.' Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S., at 251. Because `it would
         be unseemly in our dual system of government for a federal district court to upset a state
         court conviction without an opportunity to the state courts to correct a constitutional
         violation,' federal courts apply the doctrine of comity, which `teaches that one court
         should defer action on causes properly within its jurisdiction until the courts of another
         sovereignty with concurrent powers, and already cognizant of the litigation, have had an
         opportunity to pass upon the matter.' Darr v. Burford, 339 U. S. 200, 204 (1950)." Id., at
         518. <p>These same concerns apply to federal claims that have been procedurally defaulted
            in state court. Just as in those <span class="star-pagination">*732</span> cases in
            which a state prisoner fails to exhaust state remedies, a habeas petitioner who has
            failed to meet the State's procedural requirements for presenting his federal claims has
            deprived the state courts of an opportunity to address those claims in the first
            instance. A habeas petitioner who has defaulted his federal claims in state court meets
            the technical requirements for exhaustion; there are no state remedies any longer
            "available" to him. See 28 U. S. C. § 2254(b); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 125-126,
            n. 28 (1982). In the absence of the independent and adequate state ground doctrine in
            federal habeas, habeas petitioners would be able to avoid the exhaustion requirement by
            defaulting their federal claims in state court. The independent and adequate state
            ground doctrine ensures that the States' interest in correcting their own mistakes is
            respected in all federal habeas cases.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B</h2>
         <p>It is not always easy for a federal court to apply the independent and adequate state
            ground doctrine. State court opinions will, at times, discuss federal questions at
            length and mention a state law basis for decision only briefly. In such cases, it is
            often difficult to determine if the state law discussion is truly an independent basis
            for decision or merely a passing reference. In other cases, state opinions purporting to
            apply state constitutional law will derive principles by reference to federal
            constitutional decisions from this Court. Again, it is unclear from such opinions
            whether the state law decision is independent of federal law.</p>
         <p>In Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032 (1983), we provided a partial solution to this
            problem in the form of a conclusive presumption. Prior to Long, when faced with
            ambiguous state court decisions, this Court had adopted various inconsistent and
            unsatisfactory solutions including dismissal of the case, remand to the state court for
            clarification, or an independent investigation of state law. Id., at 1038-1040. These
            solutions were burdensome both to this Court and to <span class="star-pagination"
               >*733</span> the state courts. They were also largely unnecessary in those cases
            where it fairly appeared that the state court decision rested primarily on federal law.
            The most reasonable conclusion in such cases is that there is not an independent and
            adequate state ground for the decision. Therefore, in order to minimize the costs
            associated with resolving ambiguities in state court decisions while still fulfilling
            our obligation to determine if there was an independent and adequate state ground for
            the decision, we established a conclusive presumption of jurisdiction in these
            cases:</p> "[W]hen, as in this case, a state court decision fairly appears to rest
         primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with the federal law, and when the adequacy
         and independence of any possible state law ground is not clear from the face of the
         opinion, we will accept as the most reasonable explanation that the state court decided the
         case the way it did because it believed that federal law required it to do so." Id., at
         1040-1041. <p>After Long, a state court that wishes to look to federal law for guidance or
            as an alternative holding while still relying on an independent and adequate state
            ground can avoid the presumption by stating "clearly and expressly that [its decision]
            is . . . based on bona fide separate, adequate, and independent grounds." Id., at
            1041.</p>
         <p>In Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320 (1985), we applied the Long presumption in the
            context of an alleged independent and adequate state procedural ground. Caldwell, a
            criminal defendant, challenged at trial part of the prosecutor's closing argument to the
            jury, but he did not raise the issue on appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court. That
            court raised the issue sua sponte, discussing this federal question at length in its
            opinion and deciding it against Caldwell. The court also made reference to its general
            rule that issues not raised on appeal are deemed waived. The State argued to this Court
            that the procedural default constituted an independent and adequate state ground for the
            Mississippi <span class="star-pagination">*734</span> court's decision. We rejected this
            argument, noting that the state decision "`fairly appears to rest primarily on federal
            law,'" and there was no clear and express statement that the Mississippi Supreme Court
            was relying on procedural default as an independent ground. Id., at 327, quoting Long,
            supra, at 1040.</p>
         <p>Long and Caldwell were direct review cases. We first considered the problem of ambiguous
            state court decisions in the application of the independent and adequate state ground
            doctrine in a federal habeas case in Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255 (1989). Harris, a
            state prisoner, filed a petition for state postconviction relief, alleging that his
            trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance. The state trial court dismissed the
            petition, and the Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed. In its order, the Appellate
            Court referred to the Illinois rule that "`those [issues] which could have been
            presented [on direct appeal], but were not, are considered waived.'" Id., at 258. The
            court concluded that Harris could have raised his ineffective assistance claims on
            direct review. Nonetheless, the court considered and rejected Harris' claims on the
            merits. Harris then petitioned for federal habeas.</p>
         <p>The situation presented to this Court was nearly identical to that in Long and Caldwell:
            a state court decision that fairly appeared to rest primarily on federal law in a
            context in which a federal court has an obligation to determine if the state court
            decision rested on an independent and adequate state ground. "Faced with a common
            problem, we adopt[ed] a common solution." Harris, supra, at 263. Harris applied in
            federal habeas the presumption this Court adopted in Long for direct review cases.
            Because the Illinois Appellate Court did not "clearly and expressly" rely on waiver as a
            ground for rejecting Harris' ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the Long
            presumption applied and Harris was not barred from federal habeas. Harris, supra, at
            266.</p>
         <p>After Harris, federal courts on habeas corpus review of state prisoner claims, like this
            Court on direct review of state <span class="star-pagination">*735</span> court
            judgments, will presume that there is no independent and adequate state ground for a
            state court decision when the decision "fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law,
            or to be interwoven with the federal law, and when the adequacy and independence of any
            possible state law ground is not clear from the face of the opinion." Long, supra, at
            1040-1041. In habeas, if the decision of the last state court to which the petitioner
            presented his federal claims fairly appeared to rest primarily on resolution of those
            claims, or to be interwoven with those claims, and did not clearly and expressly rely on
            an independent and adequate state ground, a federal court may address the petition.<span

         <h2>III</h2>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>Coleman contends that the presumption of Long and Harris applies in this case and
            precludes a bar to habeas because the Virginia Supreme Court's order dismissing
            Coleman's appeal did not "clearly and expressly" state that it was based on state
            procedural grounds. Coleman reads Harris too broadly. A predicate to the application of
            the Harris presumption is that the decision of the last state court to which the
            petitioner presented his federal claims must fairly appear to rest primarily on federal
            law or to be interwoven with federal law.</p>
         <p>Coleman relies on other language in Harris. That opinion announces that "a procedural
            default does not bar consideration of a federal claim on either direct or habeas review
            unless the last state court rendering a judgment in the case <span
               class="star-pagination">*736</span> clearly and expressly states that its judgment
            rests on a state procedural bar." Harris, supra, at 263 (internal quotation marks
            omitted). Coleman contends that this rule, by its terms, applies to all state court
            judgments, not just those that fairly appear to rest primarily on federal law.</p>
         <p>Coleman has read the rule out of context. It is unmistakably clear that Harris applies
            the same presumption in habeas that Long and Caldwell adopted in direct review cases in
            this Court. See Harris, 489 U. S., at 263 ("Faced with a common problem we adopt a
            common solution"); see also id., at 264 ("Under our decision today, a state court need
            do nothing more to preclude habeas review than it must do to preclude direct review").
            Indeed, the quoted passage purports to state the rule "on either direct or habeas
            review." Harris, being a federal habeas case, could not change the rule for direct
            review; the reference to both direct and habeas review makes plain that Harris applies
            precisely the same rule as Long. Harris describes the Long presumption, and hence its
            own, as applying only in those cases in which "`it fairly appears that the state court
            rested its decision primarily on federal law.'" Harris, supra, at 261, quoting Long, 463
            U. S., at 1040. That in one particular exposition of its rule Harris does not mention
            the predicate to application of the presumption does not change the holding of the
            opinion.</p>
         <p>Coleman urges a broader rule: that the presumption applies in all cases in which a
            habeas petitioner presented his federal claims to the state court. This rule makes
            little sense. In direct review cases, "[i]t is . . . `incumbent upon this Court . . . to
            ascertain for itself . . . whether the asserted non-federal ground independently and
            adequately supports the [state court] judgment.'" Long, supra, at 1038, quoting Abie
            State Bank v. Bryan, 282 U. S. 765, 773 (1931). Similarly, federal habeas courts must
            ascertain for themselves if the petitioner is in custody pursuant to a state court
            judgment that rests on independent and adequate state grounds. In cases in which the
            Long and Harris presumption <span class="star-pagination">*737</span> applies, federal
            courts will conclude that the relevant state court judgment does not rest on an
            independent and adequate state ground. The presumption, like all conclusive
            presumptions, is designed to avoid the costs of excessive inquiry where a per se rule
            will achieve the correct result in almost all cases. As we explained in a different
            context:</p> "Per se rules . . . require the Court to make broad generalizations . . . .
         Cases that do not fit the generalization may arise, but a per se rule reflects the judgment
         that such cases are not sufficiently common or important to justify the time and expense
         necessary to identify them." Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36,
         50, n. 16 (1977). <p>Per se rules should not be applied, however, in situations where the
            generalization is incorrect as an empirical matter; the justification for a conclusive
            presumption disappears when application of the presumption will not reach the correct
            result most of the time. The Long and Harris presumption works because in the majority
            of cases in which a state court decision fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law
            or to be interwoven with such law, and the state court does not plainly state that it is
            relying on an independent and adequate state ground, the state court decision did not in
            fact rest on an independent and adequate state ground. We accept errors in those small
            number of cases where there was nonetheless an independent and adequate state ground in
            exchange for a significant reduction in the costs of inquiry.</p>
         <p>The tradeoff is very different when the factual predicate does not exist. In those cases
            in which it does not fairly appear that the state court rested its decision primarily on
            federal grounds, it is simply not true that the "most reasonable explanation" is that
            the state judgment rested on federal grounds. Cf. Long, supra, at 1041. Yet Coleman
            would have the federal courts apply a conclusive presumption of no independent and
            adequate state grounds in every case in which a state prisoner presented his federal
            claims to a state <span class="star-pagination">*738</span> court, regardless of whether
            it fairly appears that the state court addressed those claims. We cannot accept such a
            rule, for it would greatly and unacceptably expand the risk that federal courts will
            review the federal claims of prisoners in custody pursuant to judgments resting on
            independent and adequate state grounds. Any efficiency gained by applying a conclusive
            presumption, and thereby avoiding inquiry into state law, is simply not worth the cost
            in the loss of respect for the State that such a rule would entail.</p>
         <p>It may be argued that a broadly applicable presumption is not counterfactual after it is
            announced: Once state courts know that their decisions resting on independent and
            adequate state procedural grounds will be honored in federal habeas only if there is a
            clear and express statement of the default, these courts will provide such a statement
            in all relevant cases. This argument does not help Coleman. Even assuming that Harris
            can be read as establishing a presumption in all cases, the Virginia Supreme Court
            issued its order dismissing Coleman's appeal before this Court decided Harris. As to
            this state court order, the absence of an express statement of procedural default is not
            very informative.</p>
         <p>In any event, we decline to establish such a rule here, for it would place burdens on
            the States and state courts in exchange for very little benefit to the federal courts.
            We are, as an initial matter, far from confident that the empirical assumption of the
            argument for such a rule is correct. It is not necessarily the case that state courts
            will take pains to provide a clear and express statement of procedural default in all
            cases, even after announcement of the rule. State courts presumably have a dignitary
            interest in seeing that their state law decisions are not ignored by a federal habeas
            court, but most of the price paid for federal review of state prisoner claims is paid by
            the State. When a federal habeas court considers the federal claims of a prisoner in
            state custody for independent and adequate state law reasons, it is the State that must
            respond. It is the State that pays the price in <span class="star-pagination"
               >*739</span> terms of the uncertainty and delay added to the enforcement of its
            criminal laws. It is the State that must retry the petitioner if the federal courts
            reverse his conviction. If a state court, in the course of disposing of cases on its
            overcrowded docket, neglects to provide a clear and express statement of procedural
            default, or is insufficiently motivated to do so, there is little the State can do about
            it. Yet it is primarily respect for the State's interests that underlies the application
            of the independent and adequate state ground doctrine in federal habeas.</p>
         <p>A broad presumption would also put too great a burden on the state courts. It remains
            the duty of the federal courts, whether this Court on direct review, or lower federal
            courts in habeas, to determine the scope of the relevant state court judgment. We can
            establish a per se rule that eases the burden of inquiry on the federal courts in those
            cases where there are few costs to doing so, but we have no power to tell state courts
            how they must write their opinions. We encourage state courts to express plainly, in
            every decision potentially subject to federal review, the grounds upon which their
            judgments rest, but we will not impose on state courts the responsibility for using
            particular language in every case in which a state prisoner presents a federal claim
            &#x97; every state appeal, every denial of state collateral review &#x97; in order that
            federal courts might not be bothered with reviewing state law and the record in the
            case.</p>
         <p>Nor do we believe that the federal courts will save much work by applying the Harris
            presumption in all cases. The presumption at present applies only, when it fairly
            appears that a state court judgment rested primarily on federal law or was interwoven
            with federal law, that is, in those cases where a federal court has good reason to
            question whether there is an independent and adequate state ground for the decision. In
            the rest of the cases, there is little need for a conclusive presumption. In the absence
            of a clear indication <span class="star-pagination">*740</span> that a state court
            rested its decision on federal law, a federal court's task will not be difficult.</p>
         <p>There is, in sum, little that the federal courts will gain by applying a presumption of
            federal review in those cases where the relevant state court decision does not fairly
            appear to rest primarily on federal law or to be interwoven with such law, and much that
            the States and state courts will lose. We decline to so expand the Harris
            presumption.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B</h2>
         <p>The Harris presumption does not apply here. Coleman does not argue, nor could he, that
            it "fairly appears" that the Virginia Supreme Court's decision rested primarily on
            federal law or was interwoven with such law. The Virginia Supreme Court stated plainly
            that it was granting the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss the petition for appeal. That
            motion was based solely on Coleman's failure to meet the Supreme Court's time
            requirements. There is no mention of federal law in the Virginia Supreme Court's
            three-sentence dismissal order. It "fairly appears" to rest primarily on state law.</p>
         <p>Coleman concedes that the Virginia Supreme Court dismissed his state habeas appeal as
            untimely, applying a state procedural rule. Brief for Petitioner 9. He argues instead
            that the court's application of this procedural rule was not independent of federal
            law.</p>
         <p>Virginia Supreme Court Rule 5:5(a) declares that the 30-day requirement for filing a
            notice of appeal is "mandatory." The Virginia Supreme Court has reiterated the
            unwaivable nature of this requirement. See School Bd. of Lynchburg v. Scott, <span

            Coleman contends that in this case the Virginia Supreme Court did not automatically
            apply its time requirement. Rather, Coleman <span class="star-pagination">*741</span>
            asserts, the court first considered the merits of his federal claims and applied the
            procedural bar only after determining that doing so would not abridge one of Coleman's
            constitutional rights. In Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68 (1985), this Court held that a
            similar Oklahoma rule, excusing procedural default in cases of "fundamental trial
            error," was not independent of federal law so as to bar direct review because "the State
            ha[d] made application of the procedural bar depend on an antecedent ruling on federal
            law." Id., at 75. For the same reason, Coleman argues, the Virginia Supreme Court's time
            requirement is not independent of federal law.</p>
         <p>Ake was a direct review case. We have never applied its rule regarding independent state
            grounds in federal habeas. But even if Ake applies here, it does Coleman no good because
            the Virginia Supreme Court relied on an independent state procedural rule.</p>
         <p>Coleman cites Tharp v. Commonwealth, <span class="citation">

               </a>
            </span>, 175 S. E. 2d 277 (1970). In that case, the Virginia Supreme Court announced
            that it was ending its practice of allowing extensions of time for petitions of writs of
            error in criminal and state habeas cases:</p> "Henceforth we will extend the time for
         filing a petition for a writ of error only if it is found that to deny the extension would
         abridge a constitutional right." Id., at 3, 175 S. E. 2d, at 278. <p>Coleman contends that
            the Virginia Supreme Court's exception for constitutional claims demonstrates that the
            court will conduct at least a cursory review of a petitioner's constitutional claims on
            the merits before dismissing an appeal.</p>
         <p>We are not convinced that Tharp stands for the rule that Coleman believes it does.
            Coleman reads that case as establishing a practice in the Virginia Supreme Court of
            examining the merits of all underlying constitutional claims before denying a petition
            for appeal or writ of error as time barred. A more natural reading is that the Virginia
            Supreme Court will only grant an extension of time if the denial itself would <span
               class="star-pagination">*742</span> abridge a constitutional right. That is, the
            Virginia Supreme Court will extend its time requirement only in those cases in which the
            petitioner has a constitutional right to have the appeal heard.</p>
         <p>This was the case, for example, in Cabaniss v. Cunningham, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/va/7fNf/cabaniss-v-cunningham/">

               </a>
            </span>, 143 S. E. 2d 911 (1965). Cabaniss had defaulted the direct appeal of his
            criminal conviction because the trial court had failed to honor his request for
            appointed counsel on appeal, a request the court was required to honor under the
            Constitution. See Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353 (1963). The Virginia Supreme
            Court, on state collateral review, ordered that Cabaniss be given counsel and allowed to
            file a new appeal, although grossly out of time. 206 Va., at 335, 143 S. E. 2d, at 914.
            Enforcing the time requirements for appeal in that case would have abridged Cabaniss'
            constitutional right to counsel on appeal. See also Thacker v. Peyton, <span

            does not contend that the failure of the Virginia Supreme Court to hear his untimely
            state habeas appeal violated one of his constitutional rights.</p>
         <p>Even if we accept Coleman's reading of Tharp, however, it is clear that the Virginia
            Supreme Court did not apply the Tharp rule here. Tharp concerns the filing requirement
            for petitions. Here, it was not Coleman's petition for appeal that was late, but his
            notice of appeal. A petition for appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court is a document
            filed with that court in which the petitioner describes the alleged errors in the
            decision below. Va. Sup. Ct. Rule 5:17(c). It need only be filed within three months of
            the final judgment of a trial court. Rule 5:17(a)(1). By contrast, the notice of appeal
            is a document filed with the trial court that notifies that court and the Virginia
            Supreme Court, as well as the parties, that there will be an appeal; it is a purely
            ministerial document. Rule 5:9. The notice of the appeal must be filed within 30 <span
               class="star-pagination">*743</span> days of the final judgment of the trial court.
            Ibid. Coleman has cited no authority indicating that the Virginia Supreme Court has
            recognized an exception to the time requirement for filing a notice of appeal.</p>
         <p>Coleman cites also O'Brien v. Socony Mobil Oil Co., <span class="citation">
               <a href="/vactapp/7yxT/obrien-v-socony-mobil-oil-company/">
                  <span class="volume">207</span>
                  <span class="reporter">Va.</span>

               </a>
            </span>, 152 S. E. 2d 278 (1967). In that case, O'Brien, a civil litigant making a
            constitutional property rights claim, filed her notice of appeal several years late. She
            relied on three recent Virginia Supreme Court cases for the proposition that the court
            would waive the time requirement for notice of appeal where constitutional rights were
            at stake. See Cabaniss, supra; Thacker, supra; Stokes, supra. As noted, those were state
            habeas cases in which the Virginia Supreme Court determined that the petitioner had been
            denied direct appeal because of a constitutional error in failure to appoint
            counsel.</p>
         <p>In O'Brien, the Virginia Supreme Court expressly reserved the "question whether the
            precedent of the Cabaniss, Thacker and Stokes cases should be followed in cases
            involving denial of constitutional property rights." 207 Va., at 715, 152 S. E. 2d, at
            284. The court then addressed O'Brien's constitutional claim on the merits and ruled
            against her. As a result, there was no need to decide if she should be allowed an
            exception to the "mandatory" time requirement, id., at 709, 152 S. E. 2d, at 280, and
            her appeal was dismissed as untimely.</p>
         <p>Coleman argues that O'Brien demonstrates that the Virginia Supreme Court will review the
            merits of constitutional claims before deciding whether to dismiss an appeal as
            untimely. The court in O'Brien did conduct such a review, but the court also explicitly
            declined to announce a rule that there is a constitutional exception to the time
            requirement for filing a notice of appeal. There is no evidence other than O'Brien that
            the Virginia Supreme Court has ever conducted such a review, and O'Brien explicitly
            declined to announce such a <span class="star-pagination">*744</span> practice. We
            decline Coleman's invitation to announce such a practice for that court.</p>
         <p>Finally, Coleman argues that the Virginia Supreme Court's dismissal order in this case
            is at least ambiguous because it was issued "[u]pon consideration" of all the filed
            papers, including Coleman's petition for appeal and the Commonwealth's brief in
            opposition, both of which discussed the merits of Coleman's federal claims. There is no
            doubt that the Virginia Supreme Court's "consideration" of all filed papers adds some
            ambiguity, but we simply cannot read it as overriding the court's explicit grant of a
            dismissal motion based solely on procedural grounds. Those grounds are independent of
            federal law.</p>
         <p>Coleman contends also that the procedural bar was not adequate to support the judgment.
            Coleman did not petition for certiorari on this question, and we therefore accept the
            Court of Appeals' conclusion that the bar was adequate. See 895 F. 2d, at 143.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>IV</h2>
         <p>In Daniels v. Allen, the companion case to Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443 (1953), we
            confronted a situation nearly identical to that here. Petitioners were convicted in a
            North Carolina trial court and then were one day late in filing their appeal as of right
            in the North Carolina Supreme Court. That court rejected the appeals as procedurally
            barred. We held that federal habeas was also barred unless petitioners could prove that
            they were "detained without opportunity to appeal because of lack of counsel,
            incapacity, or some interference by officials." Id., at 485-486.</p>
         <p>Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391 (1963), overruled this holding. Noia failed to appeal at all
            in state court his state conviction, and then sought federal habeas review of his claim
            that his confession had been coerced. This Court held that such a procedural default in
            state court does not bar federal habeas review unless the petitioner has deliberately
            bypassed state procedures by intentionally forgoing an opportunity for state <span
               class="star-pagination">*745</span> review. Id., at 438-439. Fay thus created a
            presumption in favor of federal habeas review of claims procedurally defaulted in state
            court. The Court based this holding on its conclusion that a State's interest in orderly
            procedure is sufficiently vindicated by the prisoner's forfeiture of his state remedies.
            "Whatever residuum of state interest there may be under such circumstances is manifestly
            insufficient in the face of the federal policy . . . of affording an effective remedy
            for restraints contrary to the Constitution." Id., at 433-434.</p>
         <p>Our cases after Fay that have considered the effect of state procedural default on
            federal habeas review have taken a markedly different view of the important interests
            served by state procedural rules. Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536 (1976), involved a
            Louisiana prisoner challenging in federal habeas the composition of the grand jury that
            had indicted him. Louisiana law provided that any such challenge must be made in advance
            of trial or it would be deemed waived. Because Francis had not raised a timely
            objection, the Louisiana courts refused to hear his claim. In deciding whether this
            state procedural default would also bar review in federal habeas, we looked to our
            decision in Davis v. United States, 411 U. S. 233 (1973). Davis, a federal prisoner, had
            defaulted an identical federal claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure
            12(b)(2). We held that a federal court on collateral review could not hear the claim
            unless Davis could show "cause" for his failure to challenge the composition of the
            grand jury before trial and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged constitutional
            violations. Id., at 242-245.</p>
         <p>The Francis Court noted the important interests served by the pretrial objection
            requirement of Rule 12(b)(2) and the parallel state rule: the possible avoidance of an
            unnecessary trial or of a retrial, the difficulty of making factual determinations
            concerning grand juries long after the indictment has been handed down and the grand
            jury disbanded, and the potential disruption to numerous convictions of finding a defect
               <span class="star-pagination">*746</span> in a grand jury only after the jury has
            handed down indictments in many cases. Francis, supra, at 540-541. These concerns led us
            in Davis to enforce Rule 12(b)(2) in collateral review. We concluded in Francis that a
            proper respect for the States required that federal courts give to the state procedural
            rule the same effect they give to the federal rule:</p> "If, as Davis held, the federal
         courts must give effect to these important and legitimate concerns in § 2255 proceedings,
         then surely considerations of comity and federalism require that they give no less effect
         to the same clear interests when asked to overturn state criminal convictions. These
         considerations require that recognition be given `to the legitimate interests of both State
         and National Governments, and . . . [that] the National Government, anxious though it may
         be to vindicate and protect federal rights and federal interests, always [endeavor] to do
         so in ways that will not unduly interfere with the legitimate activities of the States.'
         Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, 44. `Plainly the interest in finality is the same with
         regard to both federal and state prisoners.. . . There is no reason to . . . give greater
         preclusive effect to procedural defaults by federal defendants than to similar defaults by
         state defendants. To hold otherwise would reflect an anomalous and erroneous view of
         federal-state relations.' Kaufman v. United States, 394 U. S. 217, 228." Francis, 425 U.
         S., at 541-542. <p>We held that Francis' claim was barred in federal habeas unless he could
            establish cause and prejudice. Id., at 542.</p>
         <p>Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72 (1977), applied the cause and prejudice standard more
            broadly. Sykes did not object at trial to the introduction of certain inculpatory
            statements he had earlier made to the police. Under Florida law, this failure barred
            state courts from hearing the claim on either direct appeal or state collateral review.
            We recognized that this contemporaneous objection rule served strong state interests in
            the finality of its criminal litigation. Id., at <span class="star-pagination"
               >*747</span> 88-90. To protect these interests, we adopted the same presumption
            against federal habeas review of claims defaulted in state court for failure to object
            at trial that Francis had adopted in the grand jury context: the cause and prejudice
            standard. "We believe the adoption of the Francis rule in this situation will have the
            salutary effect of making the state trial on the merits the `main event,' so to speak,
            rather than a `tryout on the road' for what will later be the determinative federal
            habeas hearing." Id., at 90.</p>
         <p>In so holding, Sykes limited Fay to its facts. The cause and prejudice standard in
            federal habeas evinces far greater respect for state procedural rules than does the
            deliberate bypass standard of Fay. These incompatible rules are based on very different
            conceptions of comity and of the importance of finality in state criminal litigation.
            See Hill, The Forfeiture of Constitutional Rights in Criminal Cases, 78 Colum. L. Rev.
            1050, 1053-1059 (1978). In Sykes, we left open the question whether the deliberate
            bypass standard still applied to a situation like that in Fay, where a petitioner has
            surrendered entirely his right to appeal his state conviction. Sykes, 433 U. S., at 88,
            n. 12. We rejected explicitly, however, "the sweeping language of Fay v. Noia, going far
            beyond the facts of the case eliciting it." Id., at 87-88.</p>
         <p>Our cases since Sykes have been unanimous in applying the cause and prejudice standard.
            Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107 (1982), held that the standard applies even in cases in
            which the alleged constitutional error impaired the truthfinding function of the trial.
            Respondents had failed to object at trial to jury instructions that placed on them the
            burden of proving self-defense. Ohio's contemporaneous objection rule barred
            respondents' claim on appeal that the burden should have been on the State. We held that
            this independent and adequate state ground barred federal habeas as well, absent a
            showing of cause and prejudice.</p>
         <p>Recognizing that the writ of habeas corpus "is a bulwark against convictions that
            violate fundamental fairness," we <span class="star-pagination">*748</span> also
            acknowledged that "the Great Writ entails significant costs." Id., at 126 (internal
            quotation marks omitted). The most significant of these is the cost to finality in
            criminal litigation that federal collateral review of state convictions entails:</p> "As
         Justice Harlan once observed, `[b]oth the individual criminal defendant and society have an
         interest in insuring that there will at some point be the certainty that comes with an end
         to litigation, and that attention will ultimately be focused not on whether a conviction
         was free from error but rather on whether the prisoner can be restored to a useful place in
         the community.' Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S. 1, 24-25 (1963) (dissenting opinion)."
         Id., at 127. <p>Moreover, "[f]ederal intrusions into state criminal trials frustrate both
            the States' sovereign power to punish offenders and their good-faith attempts to honor
            constitutional rights." Id., at 128. These costs are particularly high, we explained,
            when a state prisoner, through a procedural default, prevents adjudication of his
            constitutional claims in state court. Because these costs do not depend on the type of
            claim the prisoner raised, we reaffirmed that a state procedural default of any federal
            claim will bar federal habeas unless the petitioner demonstrates cause and actual
            prejudice. Id., at 129. We also explained in Engle that the cause and prejudice standard
            will be met in those cases where review of a state prisoner's claim is necessary to
            correct "a fundamental miscarriage of justice." Id., at 135. See also Murray v. Carrier,
            477 U. S. 478, 496 (1986) ("[W]here a constitutional violation has probably resulted in
            the conviction of one who is actually innocent, a federal habeas court may grant the
            writ even in the absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default").</p>
         <p>In Carrier, we applied the cause and prejudice standard to a petitioner's failure to
            raise a particular claim in his state <span class="star-pagination">*749</span> court
            appeal. Again, we emphasized the important interests served by state procedural rules at
            every stage of the judicial process and the harm to the States that results when federal
            courts ignore these rules:</p> "A State's procedural rules serve vital purposes at
         trial, on appeal, and on state collateral attack. . . . ". . . `Each State's complement of
         procedural rules. . . channel[s], to the extent possible, the resolution of various types
         of questions to the stage of the judicial process at which they can be resolved most fairly
         and efficiently.' [Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 10 (1984).] . . . Failure to raise a claim on
         appeal reduces the finality of appellate proceedings, deprives the appellate court of an
         opportunity to review trial error, and `undercut[s] the State's ability to enforce its
         procedural rules.' Engle, 456 U. S., at 129." Id., at 490-491. <p>In Carrier, as in Sykes,
            we left open the question whether Fay's deliberate bypass standard continued to apply
            under the facts of that case, where a state prisoner has defaulted his entire appeal.
            See Carrier, supra, at 492; Sykes, supra, at 88, n. 12. We are now required to answer
            this question. By filing late, Coleman defaulted his entire state collateral appeal.
            This was no doubt an inadvertent error, and respondent concedes that Coleman did not
            "understandingly and knowingly" forgo the privilege of state collateral appeal. See Fay,
            372 U. S., at 439. Therefore, if the Fay deliberate bypass standard still applies,
            Coleman's state procedural default will not bar federal habeas.</p>
         <p>In Harris, we described in broad terms the application of the cause and prejudice
            standard, hinting strongly that Fay had been superseded:</p> "Under Sykes and its
         progeny, an adequate and independent finding of procedural default will bar federal habeas
         review of the federal claim, unless the habeas petitioner can show `cause' for the default
         and `prejudice <span class="star-pagination">*750</span> attributable thereto,' Murray v.
         Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 485 (1986), or demonstrate that failure to consider the federal
         claim will result in a `"`fundamental miscarriage of justice.'"' Id., at 495, quoting Engle
         v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 135 (1982). See also Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S. 527, 537 (1986)."
         Harris, 489 U. S., at 262. <p>We now make it explicit: In all cases in which a state
            prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and
            adequate state procedural rule, federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the
            prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the
            alleged violation of federal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims
            will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. Fay was based on a conception of
            federal/state relations that undervalued the importance of state procedural rules. The
            several cases after Fay that applied the cause and prejudice standard to a variety of
            state procedural defaults represent a different view. We now recognize the important
            interest in finality served by state procedural rules, and the significant harm to the
            States that results from the failure of federal courts to respect them. Cf. McCleskey v.
            Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 491 (1991) ("Though Fay v. Noia, supra, may have cast doubt upon
            these propositions, since Fay we have taken care in our habeas corpus decisions to
            reconfirm the importance of finality").</p>
         <p>Carrier applied the cause and prejudice standard to the failure to raise a particular
            claim on appeal. There is no reason that the same standard should not apply to a failure
            to appeal at all. All of the State's interests &#x97; in channeling the resolution of
            claims to the most appropriate forum, in finality, and in having an opportunity to
            correct its own errors &#x97; are implicated whether a prisoner defaults one claim or
            all of them. A federal court generally should not interfere in either case. By applying
            the cause and prejudice standard uniformly to all independent and adequate state
            procedural <span class="star-pagination">*751</span> defaults, we eliminate the
            irrational distinction between Fay and the rule of cases like Francis, Sykes, Engle, and
            Carrier.</p>
         <p>We also eliminate inconsistency between the respect federal courts show for state
            procedural rules and the respect they show for their own. This Court has long understood
            the vital interest served by federal procedural rules, even when they serve to bar
            federal review of constitutional claims. In Yakus v. United States, 321 U. S. 414
            (1944), for example, the Court explained:</p> "No procedural principle is more familiar
         to this Court than that a constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as well as
         civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having
         jurisdiction to determine it." Id., at 444. <p>In Browder v. Director, Illinois Dept. of
            Corrections, 434 U. S. 257 (1978), we held that the appeal in a state prisoner federal
            habeas case was barred because untimely under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a).
            In describing the "mandatory and jurisdictional" nature of the Rule and its
            justification, we might as well have been describing Virginia Supreme Court Rule
            5:5(a):</p> "This 30-day time limit is `mandatory and jurisdictional.' The purpose of
         the rule is clear: It is `to set a definite point of time when litigation should be at an
         end, unless within that time the prescribed application has been made; and if it has not
         been, to advise prospective appellees that they are freed of the appellant's demands. Any
         other construction of the statute would defeat its purpose.' Matton Steamboat [Co. v.
         Murphy, 319 U. S. 412, 415 (1943)]." Browder, supra, at 264 (citations omitted). <p>No less
            respect should be given to state rules of procedure. See Francis, 425 U. S., at
            541-542.</p>

         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>Coleman maintains that there was cause for his default. The late filing was, he
            contends, the result of attorney error of sufficient magnitude to excuse the default in
            federal habeas.</p>
         <p>Murray v. Carrier considered the circumstances under which attorney error constitutes
            cause. Carrier argued that his attorney's inadvertence in failing to raise certain
            claims in his state appeal constituted cause for the default sufficient to allow federal
            habeas review. We rejected this claim, explaining that the costs associated with an
            ignorant or inadvertent procedural default are no less than where the failure to raise a
            claim is a deliberate strategy: It deprives the state courts of the opportunity to
            review trial errors. When a federal habeas court hears such a claim, it undercuts the
            State's ability to enforce its procedural rules just as surely as when the default was
            deliberate. 477 U. S., at 487. We concluded: "So long as a defendant is represented by
            counsel whose performance is not constitutionally ineffective under the standard
            established in Strickland v. Washington, [466 U. S. 668 (1984)], we discern no inequity
            in requiring him to bear the risk of attorney error that results in a procedural
            default." Id., at 488.</p>
         <p>Applying the Carrier rule as stated, this case is at an end. There is no constitutional
            right to an attorney in state postconviction proceedings. Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U.
            S. 551 (1987); Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1 (1989) (applying the rule to capital
            cases). Consequently, a petitioner cannot claim constitutionally ineffective assistance
            of counsel in such proceedings. See Wainwright v. Torna, 455 U. S. 586 (1982) (where
            there is no constitutional right to counsel there can be no deprivation of effective
            assistance). Coleman contends that it was his attorney's error that led to the late
            filing of his state habeas appeal. This error cannot be constitutionally ineffective;
            therefore Coleman must "bear <span class="star-pagination">*753</span> the risk of
            attorney error that results in a procedural default."</p>
         <p>Coleman attempts to avoid this reasoning by arguing that Carrier does not stand for such
            a broad proposition. He contends that Carrier applies by its terms only in those
            situations where it is possible to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.
            Where there is no constitutional right to counsel, Coleman argues, it is enough that a
            petitioner demonstrate that his attorney's conduct would meet the Strickland standard,
            even though no independent Sixth Amendment claim is possible.</p>
         <p>This argument is inconsistent not only with the language of Carrier, but with the logic
            of that opinion as well. We explained clearly that "cause" under the cause and prejudice
            test must be something external to the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be
            attributed to him: "[W]e think that the existence of cause for a procedural default must
            ordinarily turn on whether the prisoner can show that some objective factor external to
            the defense impeded counsel's efforts to comply with the State's procedural rule." 477
            U. S., at 488. For example, "a showing that the factual or legal basis for a claim was
            not reasonably available to counsel, . . . or that `some interference by officials' . .
            . made compliance impracticable, would constitute cause under this standard." Ibid. See
            also id., at 492 ("[C]ause for a procedural default on appeal ordinarily requires a
            showing of some external impediment preventing counsel from constructing or raising the
            claim").</p>
         <p>Attorney ignorance or inadvertence is not "cause" because the attorney is the
            petitioner's agent when acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, and
            the petitioner must "bear the risk of attorney error." Id., at 488. See Link v. Wabash
            R. Co., 370 U. S. 626, 634 (1962) (in "our system of representative litigation ... each
            party is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent"); Irwin v. Department of Veterans
            Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 92 (1990) (same). Attorney <span class="star-pagination"
               >*754</span> error that constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel is cause,
            however. This is not because, as Coleman contends, the error is so bad that "the lawyer
            ceases to be an agent of the petitioner." Brief for Petitioner 29. In a case such as
            this, where the alleged attorney error is inadvertence in failing to file a timely
            notice, such a rule would be contrary to well-settled principles of agency law. See, e.
            g., Restatement (Second) of Agency § 242 (1958) (master is subject to liability for harm
            caused by negligent conduct of servant within the scope of employment). Rather, as
            Carrier explains, "if the procedural default is the result of ineffective assistance of
            counsel, the Sixth Amendment itself requires that responsibility for the default be
            imputed to the State." 477 U. S., at 488. In other words, it is not the gravity of the
            attorney's error that matters, but that it constitutes a violation of petitioner's right
            to counsel, so that the error must be seen as an external factor, i. e., "imputed to the
            State." See also Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387, 396 (1985) ("The constitutional mandate
            [guaranteeing effective assistance of counsel] is addressed to the action of the State
            in obtaining a criminal conviction through a procedure that fails to meet the standard
            of due process of law").</p>
         <p>Where a petitioner defaults a claim as a result of the denial of the right to effective
            assistance of counsel, the State, which is responsible for the denial as a
            constitutional matter, must bear the cost of any resulting default and the harm to state
            interests that federal habeas review entails. A different allocation of costs is
            appropriate in those circumstances where the State has no responsibility to ensure that
            the petitioner was represented by competent counsel. As between the State and the
            petitioner, it is the petitioner who must bear the burden of a failure to follow state
            procedural rules. In the absence of a constitutional violation, the petitioner bears the
            risk in federal habeas for all attorney errors made in the course of the representation,
            as Carrier says explicitly.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>
            <span class="star-pagination">*755</span> B</h2>
         <p>Among the claims Coleman brought in state habeas, and then again in federal habeas, is
            ineffective assistance of counsel during trial, sentencing, and appeal. Coleman contends
            that, at least as to these claims, attorney error in state habeas must constitute cause.
            This is because, under Virginia law at the time of Coleman's trial and direct appeal,
            ineffective assistance of counsel claims related to counsel's conduct during trial or
            appeal could be brought only in state habeas. See Walker v. Mitchell, <span

            failing to file timely in the first forum in which a federal claim can be raised is
            cause.</p>
         <p>We reiterate that counsel's ineffectiveness will constitute cause only if it is an
            independent constitutional violation. Finley and Giarratano established that there is no
            right to counsel in state collateral proceedings. For Coleman to prevail, therefore,
            there must be an exception to the rule of Finley and Giarratano in those cases where
            state collateral review is the first place a prisoner can present a challenge to his
            conviction. We need not answer this question broadly, however, for one state court has
            addressed Coleman's claims: the state habeas trial court. The effectiveness of Coleman's
            counsel before that court is not at issue here. Coleman contends that it was the
            ineffectiveness of his counsel during the appeal from that determination that
            constitutes cause to excuse his default. We thus need to decide only whether Coleman had
            a constitutional right to counsel on appeal from the state habeas trial court judgment.
            We conclude that he did not.</p>
         <p>Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353 (1963), established that an indigent criminal
            defendant has a right to appointed counsel in his first appeal as of right in state
            court. Evitts v. Lucey, supra, held that this right encompasses a right to effective
            assistance of counsel for all criminal defendants in <span class="star-pagination"
               >*756</span> their first appeal as of right. We based our holding in Douglas on that
            "equality demanded by the Fourteenth Amendment." 372 U. S., at 358. Recognizing that
            "[a]bsolute equality is not required," we nonetheless held that "where the merits of the
            one and only appeal an indigent has as of right are decided without benefit of counsel,
            we think an unconstitutional line has been drawn between rich and poor." Id., at 357
            (emphasis in original).</p>
         <p>Coleman has had his "one and only appeal," if that is what a state collateral proceeding
            may be considered; the Buchanan County Circuit Court, after a 2-day evidentiary hearing,
            addressed Coleman's claims of trial error, including his ineffective assistance of
            counsel claims. What Coleman requires here is a right to counsel on appeal from that
            determination. Our case law will not support it.</p>
         <p>In Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S. 600 (1974), and Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551
            (1987), we declined to extend the right to counsel beyond the first appeal of a criminal
            conviction. We held in Ross that neither the fundamental fairness required by the Due
            Process Clause nor the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guarantee necessitated
            that States provide counsel in state discretionary appeals where defendants already had
            one appeal as of right. "The duty of the State under our cases is not to duplicate the
            legal arsenal that may be privately retained by a criminal defendant in a continuing
            effort to reverse his conviction, but only to assure the indigent defendant an adequate
            opportunity to present his claims fairly in the context of the State's appellate
            process." 417 U. S., at 616. Similarly, in Finley we held that there is no right to
            counsel in state collateral proceedings after exhaustion of direct appellate review. 481
            U. S., at 556 (citing Ross, supra).</p>
         <p>These cases dictate the answer here. Given that a criminal defendant has no right to
            counsel beyond his first appeal in pursuing state discretionary or collateral review, it
            would defy logic for us to hold that Coleman had a right to counsel <span
               class="star-pagination">*757</span> to appeal a state collateral determination of his
            claims of trial error.</p>
         <p>Because Coleman had no right to counsel to pursue his appeal in state habeas, any
            attorney error that led to the default of Coleman's claims in state court cannot
            constitute cause to excuse the default in federal habeas. As Coleman does not argue in
            this Court that federal review of his claims is necessary to prevent a fundamental
            miscarriage of justice, he is barred from bringing these claims in federal habeas.

         <p>I concur in the judgment of the Court and I join in its opinion, but add a few words
            concerning what occurred below. Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255 (1989), stated that "a
            procedural default does not bar consideration of a federal claim on either direct or
            habeas review unless the last state court rendering a judgment in the case `"clearly and
            expressly"' states that its judgment rests on a state procedural bar." Id., at 263,
            quoting Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320, 327 (1985), in turn quoting Michigan v.
            Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1041 (1983). If there were nothing before us but the order
            granting the State's motion to dismiss for untimeliness, it would be clear enough that
            the dismissal was based on a procedural default.</p>
         <p>But the state court did not grant the State's explicit request for an early ruling on
            the motion. Instead, the court delayed ruling on the motion to dismiss, and hence briefs
            on both the motion and the merits were filed. Six months later, the court "upon
            consideration whereof" granted the State's motion to dismiss the appeal. Hence
            petitioner's argument that the court studied the merits of the federal claims to
            determine whether to waive the procedural default, found those claims lacking, and only
            then granted the motion to dismiss; it is as though the court had said that it was
            granting the motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely because the federal <span
               class="star-pagination">*758</span> claims were untenable and provided the court no
            reason to waive the default.</p>
         <p>The predicate for this argument is that on occasion the Virginia Supreme Court waives
            the untimeliness rule. If that were true, the rule would not be an adequate and
            independent state ground barring direct or habeas review. Cf. Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S.
            68, 75 (1985). The filing of briefs and their consideration would do no more than
            buttress the claim that the rule is not strictly enforced.</p>
         <p>Petitioner argues that the Virginia court does in fact waive the rule on occasion, but I
            am not now convinced that there is a practice of waiving the rule when constitutional
            issues are at stake, even fundamental ones. The evidence is too scanty to permit a
            conclusion that the rule is no longer an adequate and independent state ground barring
            federal review. The fact that merits briefs were filed and were considered by the court,
            without more, does not justify a different conclusion.</p></div>

         <p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL and JUSTICE STEVENS join, dissenting.</p>
         <p>Federalism; comity; state sovereignty; preservation of state resources; certainty: The
            majority methodically inventories these multifarious state interests before concluding
            that the plain-statement rule of Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032 (1983), does not apply
            to a summary order. One searches the majority's opinion in vain, however, for any
            mention of petitioner Coleman's right to a criminal proceeding free from constitutional
            defect or his interest in finding a forum for his constitutional challenge to his
            conviction and sentence of death. Nor does the majority even allude to the "important
            need for uniformity in federal law," id., at 1040, which justified this Court's adoption
            of the plain-statement rule in the first place. Rather, displaying obvious exasperation
            with the breadth of substantive federal habeas doctrine and the expansive protection
            afforded by the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of fundamental fairness in state
            criminal proceedings, the Court today continues its crusade <span
               class="star-pagination">*759</span> to erect petty procedural barriers in the path of
            any state prisoner seeking review of his federal constitutional claims. Because I
            believe that the Court is creating a Byzantine morass of arbitrary, unnecessary, and
            unjustifiable impediments to the vindication of federal rights, I dissent.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>The Court cavalierly claims that "[t]his is a case about federalism," ante, at 726, and
            proceeds without explanation to assume that the purposes of federalism are advanced
            whenever a federal court refrains from reviewing an ambiguous state-court judgment.
            Federalism, however, has no inherent normative value: It does not, as the majority
            appears to assume, blindly protect the interests of States from any incursion by the
            federal courts. Rather, federalism secures to citizens the liberties that derive from
            the diffusion of sovereign power. "Federalism is a device for realizing the concepts of
            decency and fairness which are among the fundamental principles of liberty and justice
            lying at the base of all our civil and political institutions." Brennan, Federal Habeas
            Corpus and State Prisoners: An Exercise in Federalism, 7 Utah L. Rev. 423, 442 (1961).
            See also The <ref type="" num="51">Federalist</ref> No. 51, p. 324 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison) ("Justice is
            the end of government. It is the end of civil society"). In this context, it cannot
            lightly be assumed that the interests of federalism are fostered by a rule that impedes
            federal review of federal constitutional claims.</p>
         <p>Moreover, the form of federalism embraced by today's majority bears little resemblance
            to that adopted by the Framers of the Constitution and ratified by the original States.
            The majority proceeds as if the sovereign interests of the States and the Federal
            Government were coequal. Ours, however, is a federal republic, conceived on the
            principle of a supreme federal power and constituted first and foremost of citizens, not
            of sovereign States. The citizens expressly declared: "This Constitution, and the Laws
            of the United States <span class="star-pagination">*760</span> which shall be made in
            Pursuance thereof ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land." U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl.
            2. James Madison felt that a constitution without this Clause "would have been evidently
            and radically defective." The <ref type="" num="44">Federalist</ref> No. 44, p. 286 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). The
            ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment by the citizens of the several States expanded
            federal powers even further, with a corresponding diminution of state sovereignty. See
            Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 453-456 (1976); Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339,
            344-348 (1880). Thus, "the sovereignty of the States is limited by the Constitution
            itself." Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 548
            (1985).</p>
         <p>Federal habeas review of state-court judgments, respectfully employed to safeguard
            federal rights, is no invasion of state sovereignty. Cf. Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S.,
            at 346. Since 1867, Congress has acted within its constitutional authority to
            "`interpose the federal courts between the States and the people, as guardians of the
            people's federal rights&#x97; to protect the people from unconstitutional action.'" Reed
            v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 10 (1984), quoting Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U. S. 225, 242 (1972).
            See 28 U. S. C. § 2254. Justice Frankfurter, in his separate opinion in Brown v. Allen,
            344 U. S. 443, 510 (1953), recognized this:</p> "Insofar as [federal habeas]
         jurisdiction enables federal district courts to entertain claims that State Supreme Courts
         have denied rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution, it is not a case of a
         lower court sitting in judgment on a higher court. It is merely one aspect of respecting
         the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution whereby federal law is higher than State law."
            <p>Thus, the considered exercise by federal courts &#x97; in vindication of fundamental
            constitutional rights&#x97;of the habeas jurisdiction conferred on them by Congress
            exemplifies the full expression of this Nation's federalism.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*761</span> That the majority has lost sight of the
            animating principles of federalism is well illustrated by its discussion of the duty of
            a federal court to determine whether a state-court judgment rests on an adequate and
            independent state ground. According to the majority's formulation, establishing this
            duty in the federal court serves to diminish the risk that a federal habeas court will
            review the federal claims of a prisoner in custody pursuant to a judgment that rests
            upon an adequate and independent state ground. In reality, however, this duty of a
            federal court to determine its jurisdiction originally was articulated to ensure that
            federal rights were not improperly denied a federal forum. Thus, the quote artfully
            reconstituted by the majority, ante, at 736, originally read: "[I]t is incumbent upon
            this Court, when it is urged that the decision of the state court rests upon a
            non-federal ground, to ascertain for itself, in order that constitutional guarantees may
            appropriately be enforced, whether the asserted non-federal ground independently and
            adequately supports the judgment." Abie State Bank v. Bryan, 282 U. S. 765, 773 (1931)
            (emphasis added). Similarly, the Court has stated that the duty "cannot be disregarded
            without neglecting or renouncing a jurisdiction conferred by the law and designed to
            protect and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and the laws made in pursuance
            thereof." Ward v. Board of Comm'rs of Love County, 253 U. S. 17, 23 (1920). Indeed, the
            duty arose out of a distinct distrust of state courts, which this Court perceived as
            attempting to evade federal review. See Broad River Power Co. v. South Carolina ex rel.
            Daniel, 281 U. S. 537, 540 (1930) ("Even though the constitutional protection invoked be
            denied on non-federal grounds, it is the province of this Court to inquire whether the
            decision of the state court rests upon a fair and substantial basis. If unsubstantial,
            constitutional obligations may not thus be evaded").</p>
         <p>From these noble beginnings, the Court has managed to transform the duty to protect
            federal rights into a self-fashioned abdication. Defying the constitutional allocation
               <span class="star-pagination">*762</span> of sovereign authority, the Court now
            requires a federal court to scrutinize the state-court judgment with an eye to denying a
            litigant review of his federal claims rather than enforcing those provisions of the
            Federal Bill of Rights that secure individual autonomy.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>Even if one acquiesced in the majority's unjustifiable elevation of abstract federalism
            over fundamental precepts of liberty and fairness, the Court's conclusion that the
            plain-statement rule of Michigan v. Long does not apply to a summary order defies both
            settled understandings and compassionate reason.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>As an initial matter, it cannot seriously be disputed that the Court's opinion in Harris
            v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255 (1989), expressly considered this issue and resolved the question
            quite contrary to the Court's holding today. Both Long and Harris involved a federal
            review of a state-court opinion that, on its face, addressed the merits of the
            underlying claims and resolved those claims with express reference to both state and
            federal law. See Long, 463 U. S., at 1037, and n. 3; Harris, 489 U. S., at 257-258. In
            each case, it was not disputed that the alleged state ground had been invoked: The Court
            was faced with the question whether that state ground was adequate to support the
            judgment and independent of federal law. Accordingly, the Long and Harris Courts spoke
            of state-court judgments that "fairly appea[r] to rest primarily on federal law, or to
            be interwoven with federal law," Long, 463 U. S., at 1040, or that contained
            "ambiguous... references to state law." Harris, 489 U. S., at 263.</p>
         <p>The majority asserts that these statements establish a factual predicate for the
            application of the plain-statement rule. Ante, at 735-736. Neither opinion, however,
            purported to limit the application of the plain-statement rule to the narrow <span
               class="star-pagination">*763</span> circumstances presented in the case under review.
            In fact, the several opinions in Harris make plain that for purposes of federal habeas,
            the Court was adopting the Long presumption for all cases where federal claims are
            presented to state courts.</p>
         <p>The Harris Court expressed its understanding of Long unequivocally: "We held in Long
            that unless the state court clearly expressed its reliance on an adequate and
            independent state-law ground, this Court may address a federal issue considered by the
            state court." 489 U. S., at 262-263. Armed with that understanding, the Court concluded
            that "a procedural default does not bar consideration of a federal claim on either
            direct or habeas review unless the last state court rendering a judgment in the case
            `"clearly and expressly"' states that its judgment rests on a state procedural bar."
            Id., at 263, quoting Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320, 327 (1985), in turn quoting
            Long, 463 U. S., at 1041.</p>
         <p>JUSTICE O'CONNOR, in a concurring opinion joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE
            SCALIA, echoed the majority's indication that the Long presumption applied to all cases
            where a federal claim is presented to the state courts. She wrote separately to
            emphasize that the Court's opinion did not alter the well-settled rule that federal
            courts may look to state procedural-default rules in determining whether a federal claim
            has been properly exhausted in the state courts. See 489 U. S., at 268-270. "[I]t is
            simply impossible," according to the concurrence, "to `[r]equir[e] a state court to be
            explicit in its reliance on a procedural default' . . . where a claim raised on federal
            habeas has never been presented to the state courts at all." Id., at 270. Certainly, if
            the Court's opinion had been limited to cases where the state court's judgment fairly
            appeared to rest on federal law or was interwoven with federal law, the point
            painstakingly made in this concurrence would have been unnecessary.</p>
         <p>That Harris' adoption of the plain-statement rule for federal habeas cases was intended
            to apply to all cases where <span class="star-pagination">*764</span> federal claims
            were presented to the state courts is confirmed by the exchange there between the
            majority and the dissent. In his dissenting opinion, JUSTICE KENNEDY maintained that the
            Court's formulation of the plain-statement rule would encourage habeas prisoners whose
            claims would otherwise be procedurally barred to file "a never-ending stream of
            petitions for postconviction relief" in hope of being "rewarded with a suitably
            ambiguous rebuff, perhaps a one-line order finding that a prisoner's claim `lacks merit'
            or stating that relief is `denied.'" Id., at 282 (emphasis added). The Court responded
            that "the dissent's fear ... that our holding will submerge courts in a flood of
            improper prisoner petitions is unrealistic: a state court that wishes to rely on a
            procedural bar rule in a one-line pro forma order easily can write that `relief is
            denied for reasons of procedural default.'" Id., at 265, n. 12. The Harris Court's
            holding that the plain-statement rule applies to a summary order could not itself have
            been more plain. Because the majority acknowledges that the Virginia Supreme Court's
            dismissal order "adds some ambiguity," ante, at 744, Harris compels a federal habeas
            court to provide a forum for the consideration of Coleman's federal claims.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B</h2>
         <p>Notwithstanding the clarity of the Court's holding in Harris, the majority asserts that
            Coleman has read the rule announced therein "out of context." Ante, at 736. I submit,
            however, that it is the majority that has wrested Harris out of the context of a
            preference for the vindication of fundamental constitutional rights and that has set it
            down in a vacuum of rhetoric about federalism. In its attempt to justify a blind
            abdication of responsibility by the federal courts, the majority's opinion marks the
            nadir of the Court's recent habeas jurisprudence, where the discourse of rights is
            routinely replaced with the functional dialect of interests. The Court's habeas
            jurisprudence now routinely, and without evident reflection, subordinates fundamental
            constitutional rights to <span class="star-pagination">*765</span> mere utilitarian
            interests. See, e. g., McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991). Such unreflective
            cost-benefit analysis is inconsistent with the very idea of rights. See generally Cover
            &amp;amp; Aleinikoff, Dialectical Federalism: Habeas Corpus and the Court, 86 Yale L. J.
            1035, 1092 (1977). The Bill of Rights is not, after all, a collection of technical
            interests, and "surely it is an abuse to deal too casually and too lightly with rights
            guaranteed" therein. Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S., at 498 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).</p>
         <p>It is well settled that the existence of a state procedural default does not divest a
            federal court of jurisdiction on collateral review. See Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S.
            72, 82-84 (1977). Rather, the important office of the federal courts in vindicating
            federal rights gives way to the States' enforcement of their procedural rules to protect
            the States' interest in being an equal partner in safeguarding federal rights. This
            accommodation furthers the values underlying federalism in two ways. First, encouraging
            a defendant to assert his federal rights in the appropriate state forum makes it
            possible for transgressions to be arrested sooner and before they influence an erroneous
            deprivation of liberty. Second, thorough examination of a prisoner's federal claims in
            state court permits more effective review of those claims in federal court, honing the
            accuracy of the writ as an implement to eradicate unlawful detention. See Rose v. Lundy,
            455 U. S. 509, 519 (1982); Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S., at 500-501 (opinion of
            Frankfurter, J.). The majority iguores these purposes in concluding that a State need
            not bear the burden of making clear its intent to rely on such a rule. When it is
            uncertain whether a state-court judgment denying relief from federal claims rests on a
            procedural bar, it is inconsistent with federalism principles for a federal court to
            exercise discretion to decline to review those federal claims.</p>
         <p>In justifying its new rule, the majority first announces that, as a practical matter,
            the application of the Long presumption to a summary order entered in a case where a
            state <span class="star-pagination">*766</span> prisoner presented federal
            constitutional claims to a state court is unwarranted, because "it is simply not true
            that the `most reasonable explanation' is that the state judgment rested on federal
            grounds." Ante, at 737, quoting Long, 463 U. S., at 1041. The majority provides no
            support for this fiat assertion. In fact, the assertion finds no support in reality.
            "Under our federal system, the federal and state `courts [are] equally bound to guard
            and protect the rights secured by the Constitution.'" Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S., at 518,
            quoting Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241, 251 (1886). Accordingly, state prisoners are
            required to present their federal claims to state tribunals before proceeding to federal
            habeas, "to protect the state courts' role in the enforcement of federal law and prevent
            disruption of state judicial proceedings." 455 U. S., at 518. See 28 U. S. C. § 2254.
            Respect for the States' responsible assumption of this solemn trust compels the
            conclusion that state courts presented with federal constitutional claims actually
            resolve those claims unless they indicate to the contrary. Cf. Brown v. Allen, 344 U.
            S., at 512 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.) ("[The availability of the writ of habeas
            corpus] does not mean that prison doors may readily be opened. It does mean that
            explanation may be exacted why they should remain closed").</p>
         <p>The majority claims that applying the plain-statement rule to summary orders "would
            place burdens on the States and state courts," ante, at 738, suggesting that these
            burdens are borne independently by the States and their courts. The State, according to
            the majority, "pays the price" for federal review of state prisoner claims "in terms of
            the uncertainty and delay" as well as in the cost of a retrial. Id., at 738-739. The
            majority is less clear about the precise contours of the burden this rule is said to
            place on state courts, merely asserting that it "would also put too great a burden on
            the state courts." Ante, at 739.</p>
         <p>The majority's attempt to distinguish between the interests of state courts and the
            interests of the States in this <span class="star-pagination">*767</span> context is
            inexplicable. States do not exist independent of their officers, agents, and citizens.
            Rather, "[t]hrough the structure of its government, and the character of those who
            exercise government authority, a State defines itself as a sovereign." Gregory v.
            Ashcroft, ante, at 460. See also Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S., at 347 ("A State acts by
            its legislative, its executive, or its judicial authorities. It can act in no other
            way"). The majority's novel conception of dichotomous interests is entirely
            unprecedented. See ibid. ("[H]e [who] acts in the name and for the State, and is clothed
            with the State's power, his act is that of the State"). Moreover, it admits of no
            readily apparent limiting principle. For instance, should a federal habeas court decline
            to review claims that the state judge committed constitutional error at trial simply
            because the costs of a retrial will be borne by the State? After all, as the majority
            asserts, "there is little the State can do about" constitutional errors made by its
            trial judges. Ante, at 739.</p>
         <p>Even if the majority correctly attributed the relevant state interests, they are,
            nonetheless, misconceived. The majority appears most concerned with the financial burden
            that a retrial places on the States. Of course, if the initial trial conformed to the
            mandate of the Federal Constitution, not even the most probing federal review would
            necessitate a retrial. Thus, to the extent the State must "pay the price" of retrying a
            state prisoner, that price is incurred as a direct result of the State's failure
            scrupulously to honor his federal rights, not as a consequence of unwelcome federal
            review. See Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 306 (1989) (opinion of O'CONNOR, J., joined
            by REHNQUIST, C. J., and SCALIA and KENNEDY, JJ., quoting Desist v. United States, 394
            U. S. 244, 262-263 (1969) (Harlan, J., dissenting)) ("`[T]he threat of habeas serves as
            a necessary additional incentive for trial and appellate courts throughout the land to
            conduct their proceedings in a manner consistent with established constitutional
            standards'").</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*768</span> The majority also contends without elaboration
            that a "broad presumption [of federal jurisdiction] would ... put too great a burden on
            the state courts." Ante, at 739. This assertion not only finds no support in Long, where
            the burden of the presumption on state courts is not even mentioned, but also is
            premised on the misconception that the plain-statement rule serves only to relieve the
            federal court of the "bother" of determining the basis of the relevant state-court
            judgment. Viewed responsibly, the plain-statement rule provides a simple mechanism by
            which a state court may invoke the discretionary deference of the federal habeas court
            and virtually insulate its judgment from federal review. While state courts may choose
            to draw their orders as they wish, the right of a state prisoner, particularly one
            sentenced to death, to have his federal claim heard by a federal habeas court is simply
            too fundamental to yield to the State's incidental interest in issuing ambiguous summary
            orders.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>C</h2>
         <p>Not only is the majority's abandonment of the plain-statement rule for purposes of
            summary orders unjustified, it is also misguided. In Long, the Court adopted the
            plain-statement rule because we had "announced a number of principles in order to help
            us determine" whether ambiguous state-court judgments rested on adequate and independent
            state grounds, but had "not developed a satisfying and consistent approach for resolving
            this vexing issue." 463 U. S., at 1038. Recognizing that "[t]his ad hoc method of
            dealing with cases that involve possible adequate and independent state grounds is
            antithetical to the doctrinal consistency that is required when sensitive issues of
            federal-state relations are involved," id., at 1039 (emphasis added), the Court
            determined that a broad presumption of federal jurisdiction combined with a simple
            mechanism by which state courts could clarify their intent to rely on state grounds
            would best "provide state judges with a clearer opportunity to develop state <span
               class="star-pagination">*769</span> jurisprudence unimpeded by federal interference,
            and yet will preserve the integrity of federal law," id., at 1041. Today's decision
            needlessly resurrects the piecemeal approach eschewed by Long and, as a consequence,
            invites the intrusive and unsatisfactory federal inquiry into unfamiliar state law that
            Long sought to avoid.</p>
         <p>The Court's decisions in this case and in Ylst v. Nunnemaker, post, p. 797, well reveal
            the illogic of the ad hoc approach. In this case, to determine whether the admittedly
            ambiguous state-court judgment rests on an adequate and independent state ground, the
            Court looks to the "nature of the disposition" and the "surrounding circumstances" that
            "indicat[e]" that the basis [of the decision] was procedural default. Ylst, post, at
            802. This method of searching for "clues" to the meaning of a facially ambiguous order
            is inherently indeterminate. Tellingly, both the majority and concurring opinions in
            this case concede that it remains uncertain whether the state court relied on a
            procedural default. See ante, at 744 ("There is no doubt that the Virginia Supreme
            Court's `consideration' of all filed papers adds some ambiguity"); ante, at 757-758
            (WHITE, J., concurring) ("[I]t is as though the court had said that it was granting the
            motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely because the federal claims were untenable and
            provided the court no reason to waive the default"). The plain-statement rule
            effectively and equitably eliminates this unacceptable uncertainty. I cannot condone the
            abandonment of such a rule when the result is to foreclose federal habeas review of
            federal claims based on conjecture as to the "meaning" of an unexplained order.</p>
         <p>The Court's decision in Ylst demonstrates that we are destined to relive the period
            where we struggled to develop principles to guide the interpretation of ambiguous
            state-court orders. In Ylst, the last state court to render a judgment on Nunnemaker's
            federal claims was the California Supreme Court. Nunnemaker had filed a petition for
            habeas corpus in that court, invoking its original jurisdiction. Accordingly, <span
               class="star-pagination">*770</span> the court was not sitting to review the judgment
            of another state court, but to entertain, as an original matter, Nunnemaker's collateral
            challenge to his conviction. The court's order denying relief was rendered without
            explanation or citation. Rejecting the methodology employed just today by the Coleman
            majority, the Ylst Court does not look to the pleadings filed in the original action to
            determine the "meaning" of the unexplained order. Rather, the Court adopts a broad per
            se presumption that "[w]here there has been one reasoned state judgment rejecting a
            federal claim, later unexplained orders upholding that judgment or rejecting the same
            claim rest upon the same ground." Ylst, post, at 803. This presumption does not purport
            to distinguish between unexplained judgments that are entered on review of the reasoned
            opinion and those that are independent thereof.</p>
         <p>The Ylst Court demonstrates the employment of the presumption by simply ignoring the
            judgment of the highest court of California, and by looking back to an intermediate
            court judgment rendered 12 years earlier to conclude that Nunnemaker's federal claims
            have been procedurally defaulted. In so concluding, the Court determines that an
            intervening order by the California Supreme Court, which, with citations to two
            state-court decisions, denied Nunnemaker's earlier petition invoking the court's
            original jurisdiction, is not "informative with respect to the question," post, at 805,
            whether a state court has considered the merits of Nunnemaker's claims since the
            procedural default was recognized. Thus, the Court dismisses two determinations of the
            California Supreme Court, rendered not in review of an earlier state-court judgment but
            as an exercise of its original jurisdiction, because it finds those determinations not
            "informative." While the Court may comfort itself by labeling this exercise "look[ing]
            through," see post, at 804, it cannot be disputed that the practice represents
            disrespect for the State's determination of how best to structure its mechanisms for
            seeking postconviction relief.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*771</span> Moreover, the presumption adopted by the Ylst
            Court further complicates the efforts of state courts to understand and accommodate this
            Court's federal habeas jurisprudence. Under Long, a state court need only recognize that
            it must clearly express its intent to rely on a state procedural default in order to
            preclude federal habeas review in most cases. After today, however, a state court that
            does not intend to rely on a procedural default but wishes to deny a meritless petition
            in a summary order must now remember that its unexplained order will be ignored by the
            federal habeas court. Thus, the state court must review the procedural history of the
            petitioner's claim and determine which state-court judgment a federal habeas court is
            likely to recognize. It then must determine whether that judgment expresses the
            substance that the court wishes to convey in its summary order, and react accordingly.
            If the previous reasoned judgment rests on a procedural default, and the subsequent
            court wishes to forgive that default, it now must clearly and expressly indicate that
            its judgment does not rest on a state procedural default. I see no benefit in abandoning
            a clear rule to create chaos.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>Having abandoned the plain-statement rule with respect to a summary order, the majority
            must consider Coleman's argument that the untimely filing of his notice of appeal was
            the result of attorney error of sufficient magnitude as to constitute cause for his
            procedural default. In a sleight of logic that would be ironic if not for its tragic
            consequences, the majority concludes that a state prisoner pursuing state collateral
            relief must bear the risk of his attorney's grave errors&#x97;even if the result of
            those errors is that the prisoner will be executed without having presented his federal
            claims to a federal court &#x97; because this attribution of risk represents the
            appropriate "allocation of costs." Ante, at 754. Whether unprofessional attorney conduct
            in a state postconviction proceeding should bar federal habeas review of a state
            prisoner's <span class="star-pagination">*772</span> conviction and sentence of death is
            not a question of costs to be allocated most efficiently. It is, rather, another
            circumstance where this Court must determine whether federal rights should yield to
            state interests. In my view, the obligation of a federal habeas court to correct
            fundamental constitutional violations, particularly in capital cases, should not accede
            to the State's "discretion to develop and implement programs to aid prisoners seeking to
            secure postconviction review." Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 559 (1987).</p>
         <p>The majority first contends that this Court's decision in Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S.
            478 (1986), expressly resolves this issue. Of course, that cannot be so, as the
            procedural default at issue in Murray occurred on direct review, not collateral attack,
            and this Court has no authority to resolve issues not before it. Moreover,
            notwithstanding the majority's protestations to the contrary, the language of Murray
            strongly suggests that the Court's resolution of the issue would have been the same
            regardless of when the procedural default occurred. The Court in Murray explained: "A
            State's procedural rules serve vital purposes at trial, on appeal, and on state
            collateral attack." 477 U. S., at 490 (emphasis added). Rejecting Carrier's argument
            that, with respect to the standard for cause, procedural defaults on appeal should be
            treated differently from those that occur during the trial, the Court stated that "the
            standard for cause should not vary depending on the timing of a procedural default or on
            the strength of an uncertain and difficult assessment of the relative magnitude of the
            benefits attributable to the state procedural rules that attach at each successive stage
            of the judicial process." Id., at 491 (emphasis added).</p>
         <p>The rule foreshadowed by this language, which the majority today evades, most faithfully
            adheres to a principled view of the role of federal habeas jurisdiction. As noted above,
            federal courts forgo the exercise of their habeas jurisprudence over claims that are
            procedurally barred out of respect for the state interests served by those rules.
            Recognition of <span class="star-pagination">*773</span> state procedural forfeitures
            discourages petitioners from attempting to avoid state proceedings and accommodates the
            State's interest in finality. No rule, however, can deter gross incompetence. To permit
            a procedural default caused by attorney error egregious enough to constitute ineffective
            assistance of counsel to preclude federal habeas review of a state prisoner's federal
            claims in no way serves the State's interest in preserving the integrity of its rules
            and proceedings. The interest in finality, standing alone, cannot provide a sufficient
            reason for a federal habeas court to compromise its protection of constitutional
            rights.</p>
         <p>The majority's conclusion that Coleman's allegations of ineffective assistance of
            counsel, if true, would not excuse a procedural default that occurred in the state
            postconviction proceeding is particularly disturbing because, at the time of Coleman's
            appeal, state law precluded defendants from raising certain claims on direct appeal. As
            the majority acknowledges, under state law as it existed at the time of Coleman's trial
            and appeal, Coleman could raise his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim with respect
            to counsel's conduct during trial and appeal only in state habeas. Ante, at 755. This
            Court has made clear that the Fourteenth Amendment obligates a State "`to assure the
            indigent defendant an adequate opportunity to present his claims fairly in the context
            of the State's appellate process,'" Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S., at 556, quoting
            Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S. 600, 616 (1974), and "require[s] that the state appellate
            system be `free from unreasoned distinctions,'" id., at 612. While the State may have
            wide latitude to structure its appellate process as it deems most effective, it cannot,
            consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment, structure it in such a way as to deny indigent
            defendants meaningful access. Accordingly, if a State desires to remove from the process
            of direct appellate review a claim or category of claims, the Fourteenth Amendment binds
            the State to ensure that the defendant has effective assistance of counsel for the
            entirety of the procedure <span class="star-pagination">*774</span> where the removed
            claims may be raised. Similarly, fundamental fairness dictates that the State, having
            removed certain claims from the process of direct review, bear the burden of ineffective
            assistance of counsel in the proceeding to which the claim has been removed.</p>
         <p>Ultimately, the Court's determination that ineffective assistance of counsel cannot
            constitute cause of a procedural default in a state postconviction proceeding is
            patently unfair. In concluding that it was not inequitable to apply the cause and
            prejudice standard to procedural defaults that occur on appeal, the Murray Court took
            comfort in the "additional safeguard against miscarriages of justice in criminal cases":
            the right to effective assistance of counsel. 477 U. S., at 496. The Court reasoned:
            "The presence of such a safeguard may properly inform this Court's judgment in
            determining `[w]hat standards should govern the exercise of the habeas court's equitable
            discretion' with respect to procedurally defaulted claims." Ibid., quoting Reed v. Ross,
            468 U. S., at 9. "[F]undamental fairness is the central concern of the writ of habeas
            corpus." Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 697 (1984). It is the quintessence of
            inequity that the Court today abandons that safeguard while continuing to embrace the
            cause and prejudice standard.</p>
