         <p>Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>


         <span class="num">1</span>
         <p>The Supreme Court of Alabama upheld a peremptory writ of mandamus requiring the
            petitioner, the chairman of that state's Executive Committee of the Democratic Party, to
            certify respondent Edmund Blair, a member of that party, to the Secretary of State of
            Alabama as a candidate for Presidential Elector in the Democratic Primary to be held May
            6, 1952. Respondent Blair was admittedly qualified as a candidate except that he refused
            to include the following quoted words in the pledge required of party candidates a
            pledge to aid and support 'the nominees of the National Convention of the Democratic
            Party for President and Vice-President of the United States.' The chairman's refusal of
            certification was based on that omission.</p>


         <span class="num">2</span>
         <p>The mandamus was approved on the sole ground that the above requirement restricted the
            freedom of a federal elector to vote in his Electoral College for his choice for
            President. Ala.Sup., 57 So.2d 395. The pledge was held void as unconstitutional under
            the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.<a class="footnote"

            statement. Our mandate issued forthwith.</p>


         <span class="num">4</span>
         <p>The controversy arose under the Alabama laws permitting party primaries. Title 17 of the
            Code of Alabama, 1940, as amended, provides for regular optional primary elections in
            that state on the first Tuesday in May of even years by any political party, as defined
            in the chapter, at state cost. &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 336, 337, 340, 343. They are subject
            to the same penalties and punishment provisions as regular state elections. &amp;#167;
            339. Parties may select their own committee in such manner as the governing authority of
            the party may desire. &amp;#167; 341. Section 344 provides that the chairman of the
            state executive committee shall certify the candidates other than those who are
            candidates for county offices to the Secretary of State of Alabama. That official,
            within not less than 30 days prior to the time of holding the primary elections, shall
            certify these names to the probate judge of any county holding an election.</p>


         <span class="num">5</span>
         <p>Every state executive committee is given the power to fix political or other
            qualifications of its own members. It may determine who shall be entitled and qualified
            to vote in the primary election or to be a candidate therein. The qualifications of
            voters and candidates may vary.<a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref">2</a>
         </p>


         <span class="num">6</span>
         <p>Section 348 requires a candidate to file his declaration of candidacy with the executive
            committee in the form prescribed by the governing body of the party. There is a
            provision, &amp;#167; 350, which reads as follows:</p>


         <span class="num">7</span>
         <p>'At the bottom of the ballot and after the name of the last candidate shall be printed
            the following, viz: 'By casting this ballot I do pledge myself to abide by the result of
            this primary election and to aid and support all the nominees thereof in the ensuing
            general election."</p>


         <span class="num">8</span>
         <p>On consideration of these sections in other cases the Supreme Court of Alabama has
            reached conclusions generally conformable to the current of authority. Section 347 has
            been said by the Supreme Court of Alabama in Ray v. Garner, 57 So.2d 824, 826, to give
            full power to the state executive committee to determine 'who shall be entitled and
            qualified to vote in primary elections or be candidates or otherwise participate therein
            * * * just so such Committee action does not run afoul of some statutory or
            constitutional provision.'</p>


         <span class="num">9</span>
         <p>The Garner case involved a pledge adopted by the State Democratic Executive Committee
            for printing on the primary ballot, reading as follows:</p>


         <span class="num">10</span>
         <p>'By casting this ballot I do pledge myself to abide by the result of this Primary
            Election and to aid and support all the nominees thereof in the ensuing General
            Elections. I do further pledge myself to aid and support the nominees of the National
            Convention of the Democratic Party for President and Vice-President of the United
            States.' 57 So.2d 825.</p>


         <span class="num">11</span>
         <p>This is substantially the same pledge that created the controversy in this present case.
            The court also called attention approvingly to Lett v. Dennis, <span class="citation">

            requirement and make a public oath as to his vote in the past general election, where it
            was declared 'a test by a political organization of party affiliation and party fealty

            involved the selection of delegates to a national political convention. It was also said

         <span class="num">12</span>
         <p>'Primarily, the pledge must be germane to party membership and party elections and,
            while the last clause of the pledge pertains to the national party, the party in Alabama
            will be a part of it by sending delegates to participate in the national convention, the
            Executive Committee having ordered their election and the party thereby having signified
            its intention to become a member of the national party. Therefore, it was within the
            competency of the Committee to adopt the resolution so binding the voters in the
               primary.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref">5</a> 57 So.2d 826.</p>


         <span class="num">13</span>
         <p>As is well known political parties in the modern sense were not born with the Republic.
            They were created by necessity, by the need to organize the rapidly increasing
            population, scattered over our Land, so as to coordinate efforts to secure needed
            legislation and oppose that deemed undesirable. Compare Bryce, Modern Democracies, p.
            546. The party conventions of locally chosen delegates, from the county to the national
            level, succeeded the caucuses of self-appointed legislators or other interested
            individuals. Dissatisfaction with the manipulation of conventions caused that system to
            be largely superseded by the direct primary. This was particularly true in the South
            because, with the predominance of the Democratic Party in that section, the nomination
            was more important than the election. There primaries are generally, as in Alabama,
               optional.<a class="footnote" href="#fn6" id="fn6_ref">6</a> Various tests of party
            allegiance for candidates in direct primaries are found in a number of states.<a
               class="footnote" href="#fn7" id="fn7_ref">7</a> The requirement of a pledge from the
            candidate participating in primaries to support the nominee is not unusual.<a
               class="footnote" href="#fn8" id="fn8_ref">8</a> Such a provision protects a party
            from intrusion by those with adverse political principles.<a class="footnote"
               href="#fn9" id="fn9_ref">9</a> It was under the authority of &amp;#167; 347 of the
            Alabama Code, note 2, supra, that the State Democratic Executive Committee of Alabama
            adopted a resolution on January 26, 1952, requiring candidates in its primary to pledge
            support to the nominees of the National Convention of the Democratic Party for President
            and Vice-President. It is this provision in the qualifications required by the party
            under &amp;#167; 347 which the Supreme Court of Alabama held unconstitutional in this
            case.</p>


         <span class="num">14</span>
         <p>The opinion of the Supreme Court of Alabama concluded that the Executive Committee
            requirement violated the Twelfth Amendment, note 1, supra. It said:</p>


         <span class="num">15</span>
         <p>'We appreciate the argument that from time immemorial, the electors selected to vote in
            the college have voted in accordance with the wishes of the party to which they belong.
            But in doing so, the effective compulsion has been party loyalty. That theory has
            generally been taken for granted, so that the voting for a president and vice-president
            has been usually formal merely. But the Twelfth Amendment does not make it so. The
            nominees of the party for president and vice-president may have become disqualified, or
            peculiarly offensive not only to the electors but their constituents also. They should
            be free to vote for another, as contemplated by the Twelfth Amendment.'<a
               class="footnote" href="#fn10" id="fn10_ref">10</a> 57 So.2d 398.</p>


         <span class="num">16</span>
         <p>In urging a contrary view the dissenting Alabama justices, in supporting the right of
            the Committee to require this candidate to pledge support to the party nominees,
            said:</p>


         <span class="num">17</span>
         <p>'Any other view, it seems, would destroy effective party government and would privilege
            any candidate, regardless of his political persuasion, to enter a primary election as a
            candidate for elector and fix his own qualifications for such candidacy. This is
            contrary to the traditional American political system.' 57 So.2d 403.</p>


         <span class="num">18</span>
         <p>The applicable constitutional provisions on their face furnish no definite answer to the
            query whether a state may permit a party to require party regularity from its primary
            candidates for national electors.<a class="footnote" href="#fn11" id="fn11_ref">11</a>
            The presidential electors exercise a federal function in balloting for President and
            Vice-President but they are not federal officers or agents any more than the state
            elector who votes for congressmen. They act by authority of the state that in turn
            receives its authority from the federal constitution.<a class="footnote" href="#fn12"
               id="fn12_ref">12</a> Neither the language of Art. II, &amp;#167; 1, nor that of the
            Twelfth Amendment forbids a party to require from candidates in its primary a pledge of
            political conformity with the aims of the party. Unless such a requirement is implicit,
            certainly neither provision of the Constitution requires a state political party,
            affiliated with a national party through acceptance of the national call to send state
            delegates to the national convention, to accept persons as candidates who refuse to
            agree to abide by the party's requirement.<a class="footnote" href="#fn13" id="fn13_ref"

         </p>


         <span class="num">19</span>
         <p>The argument against the party's power to exclude as candidates in the primary those
            unwilling to agree to aid and support the national nominees runs as follows: The
            constitutional method for the selection of the President and Vice-President is for
            states to appoint electors who shall in turn vote for our chief executives. The
            intention of the Founders was that those electors should exercise their judgment in
            voting for President and Vice-President. Therefore this requirement of a pledge is a
            restriction in substance, if not in form, that interferes with the performance of this
            constitutional duty to select the proper persons to head the Nation, according to the
            best judgment of the elector. This interference with the elector's freedom of balloting
            for President relates directly to the general election and is not confined to the
            primary, it is contended, because under United States v. Classic, <span class="citation">

         <span class="num">20</span>
         <p>First we consider the impact of the Classic and Allwright cases on the present issues.
            In the former case, we dealt with the power of Congress to punish frauds in the
            primaries '(w)here the state law has made the primary an integral part of the procedure
            of choice'. (313 U.S. 399, 61 S.Ct. 1039.) We held that Congress had such power because
            the primary was a necessary step in the choice of candidates for election as federal
            representatives. Therefore the sanctions of &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 19 and 20 of the Old
            Criminal Code, subsequently revised as 18 U.S.C. &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 241 and 242, 18
            U.S.C.A. &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 241, 242, which forbade injury to constitutionally secured
            rights, applied to the right to vote in the primary. 313 U.S. at 317&amp;#8212;321, 61
            S.Ct. 1038 1040. In the latter, the problem was the constitutionality of the exclusion
            of citizens by a party as electors in a party primary because of race. We held, on
            consideration of state participation in the regulation of the primary, that the party
            exclusion was state action and such state action was unconstitutional because the
            primary and general election were a single instrumentality for choice of officers. The
            Fifteenth Amendment's prohibition of abridgment by a state of the right to vote on
            account of race made the exclusion unconstitutional. Consequently, under 8 U.S.C.

         <p>In Alabama, too, the primary and general elections are a part of the state-controlled
            elective process. The issue here, however, is quite different from the power of Congress
            to punish criminal conduct in a primary or to allow damages for wrongs to rights secured
            by the Constitution. A state's or a political party's exclusion of candidates from a
            party primary because they will not pledge to support the party's nominees is a method
            of securing party candidates in the general election, pledged to the philosophy and
            leadership of that party. It is an exercise of the state's right to appoint electors in
            such manner, subject to possible constitutional limitations, as it may choose.
            U.S.Const., Art. II, &amp;#167; 1. The fact that the primary is a part of the election
            machinery is immaterial unless the requirement of pledge violates some constitutional or
            statutory provision. It was the violation of a secured right that brought about the
            Classic and Allwright decisions. Here they do not apply unless there was a violation of
            the Twelfth Amendment by the requirement to support the nominees of the National
            Convention.</p>


         <span class="num">22</span>
         <p>Secondly, we consider the argument that the Twelfth Amendment demands absolute freedom
            for the elector to vote his own choice, uninhibited by pledge. It is true that the
            Amendment says the electors shall vote by ballot. But it is also true that the Amendment
            does not prohibit an elector's announcing his choice beforehand, pledging himself. The
            suggestion that in the early elections candidates for electors&amp;#8212;contemporaries
            of the Founders would have hesitated, because of constitutional limitations, to pledge
            themselves to support party nominees in the event of their selection as electors is
            impossible to accept. History teaches that the electors were expected to support the
            party nominees.<a class="footnote" href="#fn15" id="fn15_ref">15</a> Experts in the
            history of government recognize the longstanding practice.<a class="footnote"
               href="#fn16" id="fn16_ref">16</a> Indeed, more than twenty states do not print the
            names of the candidates for electors on the general election ballot. Instead in one form
            or another they allow a vote for the presidential candidate of the national conventions
            to be counted as a vote for his party's nominees for the electoral college.<a
               class="footnote" href="#fn17" id="fn17_ref">17</a> This long-continued practical
            interpretation of the constitutional propriety of an implied or oral pledge of his
            ballot by a candidate for elector as to his vote in the electoral college weights
            heavily in considering the constitutionality of a pledge, such as the one here required,
            in the primary.</p>


         <span class="num">23</span>
         <p>However, even if such promises of candidates for the electoral college are legally
            unenforceable because violative of an assumed constitutional freedom of the elector
            under the Constitution, Art. II, &amp;#167; 1, to vote as he may choose in the electoral
            college, it would not follow that the requirement of a pledge in the primary is
            unconstitutional. A candidacy in the primary is a voluntary act of the applicant. He is
            not barred, discriminatorily, from participating but must comply with the rules of the
            party. Surely one may voluntarily assume obligations to vote for a certain candidate.
            The state offers him opportunity to become a candidate for elector on his own terms,
            although he must file his declaration before the primary. Code of Ala., Tit. 17,
            &amp;#167; 145. Even though the victory of an independent candidate for elector in
            Alabama cannot be anticipated the state does offer the opportunity for the development
            of other strong political organizations where the need is felt for them by a sizable
            block of voters. Such parties may leave their electors to their own choice.</p>


         <span class="num">24</span>
         <p>We conclude that the Twelfth Amendment does not bar a political party from requiring the
            pledge to support the nominees of the National Convention. Where a state authorizes a
            party to choose its nominees for elector in a party primary and to fix the
            qualifications for the candidates, we see no federal constitutional objection to the
            requirement of this pledge.</p>

         <p>The Constitution and its Twelfth Amendment allow each State, in its own way, to name
            electors with such personal qualifications, apart from stated disqualifications, as the
            State prescribes. Their number, the time that they shall be named, the manner in which
            the State must certify their ascertainment and the determination of any contest are
            prescribed by federal law. U.S.Const., Art. II, &amp;#167; 1, 3 U.S.C.
            &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 1&amp;#8212;7, 3 U.S.C.A. &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 1&amp;#8212;7. When
            chosen, they perform a federal function of balloting for President and Vice President,
            federal law prescribing the time of meeting, the manner of certifying 'all the votes
            given by them,' and in detail how such certificates shall be transmitted and counted.
            U.S.Const., Amend. XII, 3 U.S.C. &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 9&amp;#8212;20, 3 U.S.C.A.
            &amp;#167;&amp;#167; 9&amp;#8212;20. But federal statute undertakes no control of their
            votes beyond providing 'The electors shall vote for President and Vice President,
            respectively, in the manner directed by the Constitution', 3 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 8, 3
            U.S.C.A. &amp;#167; 8, and the Constitution requires only that they 'vote by ballot for
            President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the
            same state with themselves'. U.S.Const., Amend. XII. No one faithful to our history can
            deny that the plan originally contemplated, what is implicit in its text, that electors
            would be free agents, to exercise an independent and nonpartisan judgment as to the men
            best qualified for the Nation's highest offices.<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s"
               id="fn-s_ref">*</a> Certainly under that plan no state law could control the elector
            in performance of his federal duty, any more than it could a United States Senator who
            also is chosen by, and represents, the State.</p>


         <span class="num">30</span>
         <p>This arrangement miscarried. Electors, although often personally eminent, independent,
            and respectable, officially became voluntary party lackeys and intellectual nonentities
            to whose memory we might justly paraphrase a tuneful satire:</p>


         <span class="num">31</span>
         <p>They always voted at their Party's call And never thought of thinking for themselves at
            all.</p>


         <span class="num">32</span>
         <p>As an institution the Electoral College suffered atrophy almost indistinguishable from
            rigor mortis.</p>


         <span class="num">33</span>
         <p>However, in 1948, Alabama's Democratic Party Electors refused to vote for the nominee of
            the Democratic National Convention. To put an end to such party unreliability the party
            organization, exercising state-delegated authority, closed the official primary to any
            candidate for elector unless he would pledge himself, under oath, to support any
            candidate named by the Democratic National Convention. It is conceded that under
            long-prevailing conditions this effectively forecloses any chance of the State being
            represented by an unpledged elector. In effect, before one can become an elector for
            Alabama, its law requires that he must pawn his ballot to a candidate not yet named, by
            a convention not yet held, of delegates not yet chosen. Even if the nominee repudiates
            the platform adopted by the same convention, as Democratic nominees have twice done in
            my lifetime (1904, 1928), the elector is bound to vote for him. It will be seen that the
            State has sought to achieve control of the electors' ballots. But the balloting cannot
            be constitutionally subjected to any such control because it was intended to be free, an
            act performed after all functions of the electoral process left to the States have been
            completed. The Alabama Supreme Court held that such a requirement violates the Federal
            Constitution, and I agree.</p>


         <span class="num">34</span>
         <p>It may be admitted that this law does no more than to make a legal obligation of what
            has been a voluntary general practice. If custom were sufficient authority for amendment
            of the Constitution by Court decree, the decision in this matter would be warranted.
            Usage may sometimes impart changed content to constitutional generalities, such as 'due
            process of law,' 'equal protection,' or 'commerce among the states.' But I do not think
            powers or discretions granted to federal officials by the Federal Constitution can be
            forfeited by the Court for disuse. A political practice which has its origin in custom
            must rely upon custom for its sanctions.</p>


         <span class="num">35</span>
         <p>The demise of the whole electoral system would not impress me as a disaster. At its best
            it is a mystifying and distorting factor in presidential elections which may resolve a
            popular defeat into an electoral victory. At its worst it is open to local corruption
            and manipulation, once so flagrant as to threaten the stability of the country. To
            abolish it and substitute direct election of the President, so that every vote wherever
            cast would have equal weight in calculating the result, would seem to me a gain for
            simplicity and integrity of our governmental processes.</p>


         <span class="num">36</span>
         <p>But the Court's decision does not even move in that direction. What it is doing is to
            entrench the worst features of the system in constitutional law and to elevate the
            perversion of the forefathers' plan into a constitutional principle. This judicial
            overturn of the theory that has come down to us can not plead the excuse that it is a
            practical remedy for the evils or weaknesses of the system.</p>


         <span class="num">37</span>
         <p>The Court is sanctioning a new instrument of power in the hands of any faction that can
            get control of the Democratic National Convention to make it sure of Alabama's electoral
            vote. When the party is in power this will likely be the administration faction and when
            not in power no one knows what group it will be. This device of prepledged and
            oath-bound electors imposes upon the party within the State an oath-bound regularity and
            loyalty to the controlling element in the national party. It centralizes party control
            and, instead of securing for the locality a share in the central management, it secures
            the central management in dominance of the local vote in the Electoral College. If we
            desire free elections, we should not add to the leverage over local party
            representatives always possessed by those who enjoy the prestige and dispense the
            patronage of a national administration.</p>


         <span class="num">38</span>
         <p>The view of many that it is the progressive or liberal element of the party that will
            presently advantage from this device does not prove that the device itself has any
            proper place in a truly liberal or progressive scheme of government. Who will come to
            possess this weapon and to whose advantage it will prove in the long run I am not
            foresighted enough to predict. But party control entrenched by disfranchisement and
            exclusion of nonconforming party members is a means which to my mind can not be
            justified by any end. In the interest of free government, we should foster the power and
            the will to be independent even on the part of those we may think to be independently
            wrong.</p>


         <span class="num">39</span>
         <p>Candidates for elector, like those for Senator, of course, may announce to their
            constituents their policies and preferences, and assume a moral duty to carry them out
            if they are chosen. Competition in the primary between those of different views would
            forward the representative principle. But this plan effects a complete suppression of
            competition between different views within the party. All who are not ready to follow
            blindly anyone chosen by the national convention are excluded from the primary, and
            that, in practice, means also from the election.</p>


         <span class="num">40</span>
         <p>It is not for me, as a judge, to pass upon the wisdom or righteousness of the political
            revolt this measure was designed to suppress. For me it is enough that, be it ever so
            benevolent and virtuous, the end cannot justify these means.</p>


         <span class="num">41</span>
         <p>I would affirm the decision of the Supreme Court of Alabama.</p>

         <p> This was not a unique delegation. In 1928 Merriam and Overacker cited ten other states
            which delegate to the party authorities the right to prescribe such qualifications, with
            or without a statutory statement of minimum qualifications; these ten were Delaware,
            Idaho, and the remainder of the 'solid South,' except North Carolina. See Merriam and
            Overacker, supra, note 3, at pp. 72&amp;#8212;73. In 1948 Penniman reports the continued
            existence of these delegations in all these states except Idaho, which now apparently
            requires only that the candidate 'represent the principles' of the party and be duly
            registered in the appropriate precinct. 6 Idaho Code (Bobbs-Merrill 1948)

            in several of those states: the South Carolina legislature apparently no longer
            regulates the conduct of primaries at all, see Acts S.C.1944, p. 2323, No. 810; and
            Texas and Florida have repealed their election Codes and enacted new ones which appear
            to lack any comparable provision, see The New Election Code, Vernon's Annotated Texas

            shall cast their ballots for the nominee of the national convention of the party by

         <p> As both constitutional provisions long antedated the party primary system, it is not to
            be expected that they or their legislative history would illumine this issue. They do
            not. Discussion in the Constitutional Convention as to the manner of election of the
            President resulted in the arrangement by which presidential electors were chosen by the
            state as its legislature might direct. McPherson v. Blacker, <span class="citation">

         <p>The Twelfth Amendment was brought about as the result of the difficulties caused by the
            procedure set up under Art. II, &amp;#167; 1. Under that procedure, the electors of each
            state did not vote separately for President and Vice-President; each elector voted for
            two persons, without designating which office he wanted each person to fill. If all the
            electors of the predominant party voted for the same two men, the election would result
            in a tie, and be thrown into the House, which might or might not be sympathetic to that
            party. During the John Adams administration, we had a President and Vice-President of
            different parties, a situation which could not commend itself either to the Nation or to
            most political theorists.</p>
         <p>The situation was manifestly intolerable. Accordingly the Twelfth Amendment was adopted,
            permitting the electors to vote separately for presidential and vice-presidential
            candidates. Under this procedure, the party electors could vote the regular party ticket
            without throwing the election into the House. Electors could be chosen to vote for the
            party candidates for both offices, and the electors could carry out the desires of the
            people, without confronting the obstacles which confounded the elections of 1796 and
            1800. See 11 Annals of Congress 1289&amp;#8212;1290, 7th Cong., 1st Sess. (1802).</p>

         <p> The Supreme Court of Alabama has just said that the Democratic Party of that state was
            thus affiliated with the national organization. See the excerpt from Ray v. Garner, in
            the text at note 5, supra.</p>


         <a class="footnote" href="#fn14_ref">14</a>
         <p> There is also a suggestion that, since the Alabama primary is an integral part of the
            general election, the Fourteenth Amendment, which among other prohibitions forbids a
            state to exclude voters on account of their color, also forbids a state to exclude
            candidates because they refuse to pledge their votes. The answer to this suggestion is
            that the requirement of this pledge, unlike the requirement of color, is reasonably
            related to a legitimate legislative objective&amp;#8212;namely, to protect the party
            system by protecting the party from a fraudulent invasion by candidates who will not
            support the party. See note 9, supra. In facilitating the effective operation of
            democratic government, a state might reasonably classify voters or candidates according
            to party affiliations, but a requirement of color, as we have pointed out before, is not
            reasonably related to any legitimate legislative objective. Nixon v. Herndon, <span

         <p>Furthermore, the Fifteenth Amendment directly forbids abridgment on account of color of
            the right to vote.</p>

         <p> 11 Annals of Congress 1289&amp;#8212;1290, 7th Cong., 1st Sess. (1802):</p>
         <p>'Under the Constitution electors are to vote for two persons, one of whom does not
            reside in the State of the electors; but it does not require a designation of the
            persons voted for. Wise and virtuous as were the members of the Convention, experience
            has shown that the mode therein adopted cannot be carried into operation; for the people
            do not elect a parson for an elector who, they know, does not intend to vote for a
            particular person as President. Therefore, practically, the very thing is adopted,
            intended by this amendment.'</p>
         <p>S.Rep.No.22, 19th Cong., 1st Sess. (1826), p. 4:</p>
         <p>'In the first election hold under the constitution, the people looked beyond these
            agents (electors), fixed upon their own candidates for President and Vice President and
            took pledges from the electoral candidates to obey their will. In every subsequent
            election, the same thing has been done. Electors, therefore, have not answered the
            design of their institution. They are not the independent body and superior characters
            which they were intended to be. They are not left to the exercise of their own judgment:
            on the contrary, they give their vote, or bind themselves to give it, according to the
            will of their constituents. They have degenerated into mere agents, in a case which
            requires no agency, and where the agent must be useless, if he is faithful, and
            dangerous, if he is not.' See 2 Story on the Constitution, &amp;#167; 1463 (5th ed.,

            demonstrated that, whether chosen by the legislatures or by popular suffrage on general
            ticket or in districts, they were so chosen simply to register the will of the
            appointing power in respect of a particular candidate.'</p>
         <p>III Cyclopedia of American Government (Appleton, 1914) Presidential Elections by Albert
            Bushnell Hart, p. 8:</p>
         <p>'In the three elections of 1788&amp;#8212;89, 1792 and 1796 there was a liberal
            scattering of votes, 13 persons receiving votes in 1796; but in 1800 there were only
            five names votes on. As early as 1792 an understanding was established between the
            electors in some of the different states that they should combine on the same man; and
            from 1796 on there were always, with the exception of the two elections of 1820 and
            1824, regular party candidates. In practice most of the members of the electoral
            colleges belonged to a party, and expected to support it; and after 1824 it became a
            fixed principle that the electors offered themselves for the choice of the voters or
            legislatures upon a pledge to vote for a predesignated candidate.'</p>

         <p>'It was desirable that the sense of the people should operate in the choice of the
            person to whom so important a trust was to be confided. This end will be answered by
            committing the right of making it, not to any pree stablished body, but to men chosen by
            the people for the special purpose, and at the particular conjuncture.</p>
         <p>'It was equally desirable, that the immediate election should be made by men most
            capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under
            circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the
            reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. A small number of
            persons, selected by their fellowcitizens from the general mass, will be most likely to
            possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated
            investigations.'</p>
