         <p>MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
         <p>These two writs of certiorari bring before this Court contentions in regard to the
            application to the respective respondents, Carter &amp;amp; Weekes Stevedoring Company
            and John T. Clark &amp;amp; Son, of New York City, of the general <span
               class="star-pagination">*424</span> business tax laws covering, when both cases are
            considered, the years 1937 to 1941, inclusive.<span class="sup">[1]</span> The character
            of the taxes in issue will appear from a section, set out below, of a local law imposing
            the tax for 1939 and 1940.<span class="sup">[2]</span> The respective taxpayers are
            liable also for the general income and ad valorem taxes for the State and City of New
            York. Both respondents are corporations engaged in the business of general stevedoring.
            For these cases, the business of respondents may be considered as consisting only of
            taking freight from a convenient place on the pier or lighter wholly within the
            territorial limits of New York City and <span class="star-pagination">*425</span>
            storing it properly for safety and for handling in or on the outgoing vessel alongside,
            or of similarly unloading a vessel on its arrival. The vessels moved in interstate or
            foreign commerce, without a call at any other port of New York. We do not find it
            necessary to consider separately interstate and foreign commerce. The Commerce Clause
            covers both.</p>
         <p>Through statutory proceedings unnecessary to particularize, the Comptroller of the City
            of New York determined that the respondents were liable for percentage taxes upon the
            entire gross receipts from the above activities for the years in question under the
            provisions of the respective local laws to which reference has been made. Review of
            these determinations was had by respondents in the Supreme Court of New York, Appellate
            Division. The determinations of the Comptroller were annulled on the authority of Puget
            Sound Stevedoring Co. v. Tax Commission, <span class="citation">

            certiorari to this Court were sought and granted on the issue of whether or not this tax

         <p>Petitioners recognize the force of the Puget Sound case as a precedent. Their argument
            is that subsequent holdings of this Court have indicated that the reasons which underlay
            the decision are no longer controlling in judicial examination of the constitutionality
            of state taxation of <span class="star-pagination">*426</span> the gross proceeds
            derived from commerce, subject to federal regulation. They cite, among others, these

         <p>In the Puget Sound case a state tax on gross receipts, indistinguishable from that laid
            by New York City in this case, was held invalid as applied to stevedoring activities
            exactly like those with which we are here concerned. The Puget Sound opinion pointed
            out, p. 92 et seq., that transportation by water is impossible without loading and
            unloading. Those incidents to transportation occupy the same relation to that commerce
            whether performed by the crew or by stevedore, contracting independently to handle the
            cargo. The movement of cargo off and on the ship is substantially a continuation of the
            transportation. Cf. Baltimore &amp;amp; O.S.W.R. Co. v. Burtch, 263 U.S. 540.</p>
         <p>It is trite to repeat that the want of power in the confederation to regulate commerce
            was a principal reason for the adoption of the Constitution. The Commerce Clause bears
            no limitation of power upon its face and, when the Congress acts under it,
            interpretation has suggested none, except such as may be prescribed by the Constitution.

            state's power to tax the things or activities or persons within its boundaries. What
            limitations there are spring from applications to state tax situations of general
            clauses of the Constitution. E.g., Art. I, ยง 10, Cl. 2 and 3; New York Indians, 5 Wall.

            </span>, 581-82. From the Commerce Clause itself, there comes, also, an abridgment of
            the state's power to tax within its territorial limits. This has arisen from
            long-continued judicial interpretation that, without congressional action, the words
            themselves of the Commerce Clause forbid undue interferences by the states with
            interstate commerce<span class="sup">[4]</span> and that this rule applies in full force
            to an unapportioned<span class="sup">[5]</span> tax on the gross proceeds from
            interstate business,<span class="sup">[6]</span> where the taxes were not in lieu of ad
            valorem taxes on property.<span class="sup">[7]</span>
         </p>
         <p>We do not think that a tax on gross income from stevedoring, obviously a "continuation
            of the transportation," is a tax apportioned to income derived from activities within
            the taxing state. The transportation in commerce, at the least, begins with loading and
            ends with unloading. Loading and unloading has effect on transportation <span
               class="star-pagination">*428</span> outside the taxing state because those activities
            are not only preliminary to but are an essential part of the safety and convenience of
            the transportation itself.</p>
         <p>When we come to weigh the burden or interference of this tax on the gross receipts from
            interstate commerce, the purposes of that portion of the Commerce Clause &#x97; the
            freeing of business from unneighborly regulations that inhibit the intercourse which
            supplies reciprocal wants by commerce<span class="sup">[8]</span> &#x97; is a
            significant factor for consideration. An interpretation of the text to leave the states
            free to tax commerce until Congress intervened would have permitted intolerable
            discriminations. Nippert v. City of Richmond, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/wZt/nippert-v-richmond/">
                  <span class="volume">327</span>
                  <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
                  <span class="page">416</span>
               </a>
            </span>, and cases collected in notes 13, 14, 15 and 16. Nevertheless, a proper regard
            for the authority of the states and their right to require interstate commerce to
            contribute by taxes to the support of the state governments which make their interstate
            commerce possible, has led Congress, over a long period, to leave intact the judicial
            rulings, referred to above, that apportioned, non-discriminatory gross receipt taxes or
            those fairly levied in lieu of property taxes conformed to the requirements of the
            Commerce Clause. As the power lies in Congress under the Clause to make any desired
            adjustment in the taxation area, its acquiescence in our former rulings on state
            taxation indicates its agreement with the adjustments of the competing interests of
            commerce and necessary state revenues.<span class="sup">[9]</span> There is another
            reason that may be the basis for the acceptance, almost <span class="star-pagination"
               >*429</span> complete, by Congress of the judicial interpretations in this field.
            This is that a wide latitude exists for permissible state taxation. This term, in an
            effort to show that the reach of the Commerce Clause did not destroy the state's power
            to make commerce pay its way, we elaborated the fact that taxes on the commerce itself
            was not the sole source of state revenue from that commerce. Freeman v. Hewit, supra, p.
            254; see also Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen, supra, 310.</p>
         <p>A power in a state to tax interstate commerce or its gross proceeds, unhampered by the
            Commerce Clause, would permit a multiple burden upon that commerce. This has been noted
            as ground for their invalidation. Western Live Stock v. Bureau, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/wBo/western-live-stock-v-bureau-of-revenue/">
                  <span class="volume">303</span>
                  <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
                  <span class="page">250</span>
               </a>
            </span>, 255. The selection of an intrastate incident as the taxable event actually
            carries a similar threat to the commerce but, where the taxable event is considered
            sufficiently disjoined from the commerce, it is thought to be a permissible state
               levy.<span class="sup">[10]</span> This result generally is reached because the local
            incident selected is one that is essentially local and is not repeated in each taxing
            unit. In the present case, the threat of a multiple burden, except in the few instances
            in the record of interstate, in distinction to foreign, commerce, is absent. The
            multiple burden on interstate transportation from taxation of the gross receipts from
            stevedoring arises from the possibility of a similar tax for unloading. The actual
            effect on the cost of carrying on the commerce does not differ from that imposed by any
            other tax exaction &#x97; ad valorem, net income or excise. Cf. Western Live Stock v.
            Bureau, supra, 254. We need consider only whether or not the loading and unloading is
            distinct enough from the commerce to permit the tax on the gross.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*430</span> On precedent, the Puget Sound case is
            controlling. It was promptly and recently cited with approval.<span class="sup"
               >[11]</span> It appears in Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen<span class="sup">[12]</span> in
            support of the possible double tax argument against levies on interstate commerce. In
            Western Live Stock v. Bureau, supra, 258, it was adverted to as a case for comparison
            with a ruling that "preparing, printing and publishing magazine advertising is
            peculiarly local and distinct from its circulation whether or not that circulation be
            interstate commerce." The case was not included in the Court's opinion in Gwin, White
            &amp;amp; Prince, Inc. v. Henneford,<span class="sup">[13]</span> where a state gross
            receipts tax on income from marketing fruit interstate was invalidated under the
            Commerce Clause, or in McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Co.,<span class="sup">[14]</span>
            though relied upon in the concurring opinion in the first at p. 442 and the dissent in
            the second at p. 62. Upon examination this history gives an impression that there has
            been a doubt as to the continued vitality of Puget Sound. We come now face to face with
            the problem of overruling or approving the case.</p>
         <p>Since Puget Sound there has been full consideration of how far a state may go in taxing
            intrastate incidents closely related in time and movement to the interstate commerce.
            The cases that lend strongest support to petitioner's argument for overruling the Puget
            Sound decision have been referred to above. We comment further upon them. The 2% excise
            tax levied by New Mexico on the gross receipts of publishers from advertising, upheld in
            Western Live Stock, was found to be an exaction <span class="star-pagination"

            p. 48:</p> "Certain types of tax may, if permitted at all, so readily be made the
         instrument of impeding or destroying interstate commerce as plainly to call for their
         condemnation as forbidden regulations. Such are the taxes already noted which are aimed at
         or discriminate against the commerce or impose a levy for the privilege of doing it, or tax
         interstate transportation or communication or their gross earnings, or levy an exaction on
         merchandise in the course of its interstate journey." <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*433</span> Though all of these cases were closely related
            to transportation in commerce both in time and movement, it will be noted that in each
            there can be distinguished a definite separation between the taxable event and the
            commerce itself. We have no reason to doubt the soundness of their conclusions.</p>
         <p>Stevedoring is more a part of the commerce than any of the instances to which reference
            has just been made. Although state laws do not discriminate against interstate commerce
            or in actuality or by possibility subject it to the cumulative burden of multiple
            levies, those laws may be unconstitutional because they burden or interfere with
            commerce. See Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, <span class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">325</span>

               <span class="page">761</span>
            </span>, 767. Stevedoring, we conclude, is essentially a part of the commerce itself and
            therefore a tax upon its gross receipts or upon the privilege of conducting the business
            of stevedoring for interstate and foreign commerce, measured by those gross receipts, is
            invalid. We reaffirm the rule of Puget Sound Stevedoring Company. "What makes the tax
            invalid is the fact that there is interference by a State with the freedom of interstate
            commerce." Freeman v. Hewit, supra, p. 256. Such a rule may in practice prohibit a tax
            that adds no more to the cost of commerce than a permissible use or sales tax. What
            lifts the rule from formalism is that it is a recognition of the effects of state
            legislation and its actual or probable consequences. Not only does it follow a line of
            precedents outlawing taxes on the commerce itself but it has reason to support it in the
            likelihood that such legislation will flourish more luxuriantly where the most revenue
            will come from foreign or interstate commerce. Thus in port cities and transportation or
            handling centers, without discrimination against out-of-state as compared with local
            business, larger proportions of necessary revenue could be obtained from the flow of
            commerce. The avoidance of such a local <span class="star-pagination">*434</span> toll
            on the passage of commerce through a locality was one of the reasons for the adoption of
            the Commerce Clause.</p>

            receipts from interstate transportation would be "a regulation of the commerce, a
            restriction upon it, a burden upon it. Clearly this could not be done by the state

         <p>The tax in that case was a tax on the gross receipts from fares and freight for the
            transportation of persons and goods in interstate and foreign commerce. It was
            unapportioned. As we shall see, the holding in the Philadelphia &amp;amp; Southern S.S.
            Co. case has not been impaired. But the principle it announced &#x97; that a tax on the
            gross receipts was forbidden because it was a regulation of interstate or foreign
            commerce &#x97; was not given full scope. For soon gross receipts taxes on businesses
            engaged in interstate commerce (including transportation or communication) were
            sustained where they were not discriminatory and where they were fairly apportioned to

            Prince, Inc. v. Henneford, supra, unapportioned gross receipts taxes as applied to the
            receipts from interstate sales were held invalid. It was said that the vice of such a
            tax was that interstate commerce would be subjected "to the risk of a double tax burden
            to which intrastate commerce is not exposed . .. ." Adams Mfg: Co. v. Storen, supra, p.
            311. Or as stated in Gwin, White &amp;amp; Prince, Inc. v. Henneford, supra, p. 439:</p>
         "Here the tax, measured by the entire volume of the interstate commerce in which appellant
         participates, is not apportioned to its activities within the state. If Washington is free
         to exact such a tax, other states to which the commerce extends may, with equal right,
            <span class="star-pagination">*437</span> lay a tax similarly measured for the privilege
         of conducting within their respective territorial limits the activities there which
         contribute to the service. The present tax, though nominally local, thus in its practical
         operation discriminates against interstate commerce, since it imposes upon it, merely
         because interstate commerce is being done, the risk of a multiple burden to which local
         commerce is not exposed." <p>As was later stated in Southern Pacific Co. v. Gallagher,
               <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/ayKF/southern-pacific-co-v-gallagher/">

            interstate transportation, "The measurement of a tax by gross receipts where it cannot
            result in a multiplication of the levies it upheld."</p>
         <p>Under that view the Philadelphia &amp;amp; Southern S.S. Co. case would be decided one
            way and the Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. case the other. As we have noted, the tax in the
            Philadelphia &amp;amp; Southern S.S. Co. case was a gross receipts tax on fares and
            freight for the transportation of persons and goods in interstate and foreign commerce.
            It was unapportioned. And there was the risk of multiple taxation to which local
            transportation, though also taxed, was not subjected. The same was true of Ratterman v.

         <p>But in the Puget Sound case any risk of multiple taxation was absent. The same is true
            of the present case. For in each the activity of loading and unloading was confined
            exclusively to the State that imposed the tax. No other State could tax the same
               activity.<span class="sup">[3]</span> The tax <span class="star-pagination"
               >*438</span> therefore is in its application nothing more than a gross receipts tax
            apportioned to reach only income derived from activities within the taxing State. The
            gross receipts reflect values attributable to the business or property wholly within the
            taxing state. Under the test of our recent decisions (Western Live Stock v. Bureau of
            Revenue, supra; Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen, supra; Gwin, White &amp;amp; Prince, Inc. v.
            Henneford, supra), the tax would therefore seem to be unobjectionable.</p>
         <p>It is true, however, that taxes on gross receipts of transportation companies and other
            interstate enterprises were held invalid in cases prior to the Puget Sound case, even
            though all of the activities were confined to the taxing state and could not be taxed by
            any other state. Galveston, Harrisburg &amp;amp; S.A. Ry. Co. v. Texas, 210 U.S. 217;
            New Jersey Bell Tel. Co. v. State Board, 280 U.S. 338. Cf. Fargo v. Michigan, 121 U.S.
            230. The explanation given in the Galveston case was that a tax on the gross receipts
            was a regulation of commerce, as the Philadelphia &amp;amp; Southern S.S. Co. case held.
            It distinguished Maine v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co., supra, and the other apportionment cases
            on the ground that they involved taxes on property, the gross receipts being taken as
            the measure of the value of the property. The Court said (210 U.S., p. 227):</p> "It
         appears sufficiently, perhaps from what has been said, that we are to look for a practical
         rather than a logical or philosophical distinction. The State must be allowed to tax the
         property and to tax it at its actual value as a going concern. On the other hand the State
         cannot tax the interstate business. <span class="star-pagination">*439</span> The two
         necessities hardly admit of an absolute logical reconciliation. Yet the distinction is not
         without sense. When a legislature is trying simply to value property, it is less likely to
         attempt to or effect injurious regulation than when it is aiming directly at the receipts
         from interstate commerce. A practical line can be drawn by taking the whole scheme of
         taxation into account. That must be done by this court as best it can. Neither the state
         courts nor the legislatures, by giving the tax a particular name or by the use of some form
         of words, can take away our duty to consider its nature and effect. If it bears upon
         commerce among the States so directly as to amount to a regulation in a relatively
         immediate way, it will not be saved by name or form." <p>The Galveston case, like the
            Philadelphia &amp;amp; Southern S.S. Co. case, involved a tax applicable to
            transportation companies alone.<span class="sup">[4]</span> Whatever may be said for the
            proposition <span class="star-pagination">*440</span> that a gross receipts tax,
            applicable only to transportation companies, may readily become the instrument for
            impeding or destroying interstate commerce, that consideration has no relevancy here.
            For in the present case, as in the Puget Sound case, all businesses are taxed alike.
            There is equality throughout; and interstate commerce is taxed no heavier than local
            business. Political restraints, perhaps lacking when a particular type of business is
            singled out for special taxation, would not be absent here.</p>
         <p>Moreover, the difference between a tax on property measured by gross receipts and a tax
            on the gross receipts does not appear significant in constitutional terms when the issue
            is one of undue burden on interstate commerce. Either might be an instrument to that
            end. The apportioned gross receipts tax in Maine v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co., supra, was in
            terms "an annual excise tax for the privilege of exercising" the corporation's
            franchises in the State. 142 U.S. p. 219. The Court stated, p. 228, "a resort to those
            receipts was simply to ascertain the value of the business done by the corporation, and
            thus obtain a guide to a reasonable conclusion as to the amount of the excise tax which
            should be levied. . . ." As much can be said of the present case and of the Puget Sound
            case. While the tax is in terms one on the privilege of doing business, resort is made
            to the gross receipts merely to ascertain the value of the business. No vice of
            extra-territoriality or multiple taxation is involved. The value taxed is attributable
            to business within the taxing State and may not be reached by any other State. That
            value <span class="star-pagination">*441</span> is, of course, augmented by the
            interstate character of the business. But the same is true in any apportionment case.

            v. Minnesota, supra, pp. 455-456.</p>
         <p>Respondents pay other taxes to New York City, including the usual property taxes. But so
            long as a tax does not discriminate against interstate commerce and is fairly
            apportioned to the activities in the taxing state, taxing the business twice is for
            constitutional purposes no different than doubling a single tax. If the whole scheme of
            taxation adopted by a particular State were taken into account, it might be that a case
            of discrimination against interstate commerce could be made out. But there is no
            suggestion that this is such a case. Nor can we say that the system which has been
            adopted here bids fair to be more harmful to interstate commerce than a system designed
            to raise the same amount of revenue by the use of a gross receipts tax in lieu of
            property taxes.</p>
         <p>Moreover, as noted in Gwin, White &amp;amp; Prince, Inc. v. Henneford, supra, p. 438,
            and in Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen, supra, pp. 312-313, there have been other cases
            sustaining a gross receipts tax on interstate enterprises where the gross receipts tax
            fairly measured the value of a local privilege or franchise and all risk of multiple
            taxation was absent. Ficklen v. Shelby County Taxing Dist., <span class="citation">

            They are apportioned to the activities taxed, all of which are intrastate. Plainly the
            loading and unloading involved in the present case are activities as local in character
            as the brokerage activities in the Ficklen case or the manufacturing business in the
            American Mfg. Co. case. One has as close and as immediate a relationship to interstate
            commerce as the other. Cf. United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100. If one gives rise to a
            taxable event for which the State may exact a portion of the gross receipts, it is
            difficult to see why the other does not. The practical effect on interstate commerce is
            the same in each.</p>
         <p>In McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Co., supra, p. 52, we held that a sales tax on the
            purchase of property at the end of its interstate journey was not to be distinguished
            from a tax on the property itself. For taxation of the sale was merely taxation of the
            exercise of one of the constituent elements of the property. Unless formal doctrine is
            to be restored to this field, the label which the tax bears should not be controlling;
            and the tax should be sustained unless it evinces hostility to interstate commerce or in
            practical operation obstructs or impedes it. Either result may obtain whether the tax be
            called a property tax or a gross receipts tax. As McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Co.,
            supra, p. 48, states:</p> "Certain types of tax may, if permitted at all, so readily be
         made the instrument of impeding or destroying interstate commerce as plainly to call for
         their condemnation as forbidden regulations. Such are the taxes already noted which are
         aimed at or discriminate against the commerce or impose a levy for the privilege of doing
         it, or tax interstate transportation <span class="star-pagination">*443</span> or
         communication or their gross earnings, or levy an exaction on merchandise in the course of
         its interstate journey. Each imposes a burden which intrastate commerce does not bear, and
         merely because interstate commerce is being done places it at a disadvantage in comparison
         with intrastate business or property in circumstances such that if the asserted power to
         tax were sustained, the states would be left free to exert it to the detriment of the
         national commerce." <p>Measured by that test, the present tax is not invalid. "Even
            interstate business must pay its way. . . ." Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Richmond,

            the taxing state, is to be judged by its practical effect. As we stated in Wisconsin v.

         strict observance of rigid categories nor precision of technical phrasing in their exercise
         of the most basic power of government, that of taxation. For constitutional purposes the
         decisive issue turns on the operating incidence of a challenged tax. A state is free to
         pursue its own fiscal policies, unembarrassed by the Constitution, if by the practical
         operation of a tax the state has exerted its power in relation to opportunities which it
         has given, to protection which it has afforded, to benefits which it has conferred by the
         fact of being an orderly, civilized society." <p>All local taxes on interstate businesses
            affect to some degree the commerce and increase the cost of doing it. Matters of form
            should not be decisive if the tax threatens no harm to interstate commerce.</p>
         <p>Prior to McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Co., supra, it had long been said that "Interstate
            commerce cannot be taxed <span class="star-pagination">*444</span> at all, even though
            the same amount of tax should be laid on domestic commerce, or that which is carried on

            the ground that the delivery was not a part of interstate commerce . . . but because the

            another.</p>
         <p>Second. I think the tax is unconstitutional insofar as it reaches the gross receipts
            from loading and unloading vessels engaged in foreign commerce. Such a tax is repugnant
            to Article I, ยง 10, Clause 2 of the Constitution, which provides that "No State shall,
            without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports,
            except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it's inspection Laws. . . ."</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*445</span> Loading and unloading are a part of "the
            exporting process" which the Import-Export Clause protects from state taxation. See
            Thames &amp;amp; Mersey Ins. Co. v. United States, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/vfH/thames-mersey-marine-ins-co-v-united-states/">

               </a>
            </span>, 68. As the Court says, loading and unloading cargo are "a continuation of the
            transportation." Indeed, the commencement of exportation would occur no later. See
            Richfield Oil Corp. v. State Board, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/x1L/richfield-oil-corp-v-state-bd-of-equalization/">

               </a>
            </span>. And the gross receipts tax is an impost on an export within the meaning of the
            Clause, since the incident "which gave rise to the accrual of the tax was a step in the
            export process." Richfield Oil Corp. v. State Board, supra, p. 84.</p>
         <p>As we pointed out in that case, the Commerce Clause and the Import-Export Clause "though
            complementary, serve different ends." 329 U.S. p. 76. Since the Commerce Clause does not
            expressly forbid any tax, the Court has been free to balance local and national
            interests. Taxes designed to make interstate commerce bear a fair share of the cost of
            local government from which it receives benefits have been upheld; taxes which
            discriminate against interstate commerce, which impose a levy for the privilege of doing
            it, or which place an undue burden on it have been invalidated. But the Import-Export
            Clause is written in terms which admit of no exception but the single one it contains.
            Accordingly a state tax might survive the tests of validity under the Commerce Clause
            and fail to survive the Import-Export Clause. For me the present tax is a good
            example.</p>
         <p>MR. JUSTICE MURPHY joins in this dissent except as to the second part, as to which he is
            of the opinion that the tax in relation to the gross receipts from loading and unloading
            vessels engaged in foreign commerce is constitutional.</p>

            with citizens of the State and those of other States or foreign countries. But that case
            dealt with a municipal license fee for pursuing the occupation of a manufacturer in St.
            Louis. The exaction was not an excise laid upon the taxpayer's sales or upon the income
            derived from sales. The tax on the privilege for the ensuing year was measured by a
            percentage of the past year's sales. The taxpayer had during the preceding year removed
            some of the goods manufactured to a warehouse in another State and, upon sale, delivered
            them from the warehouse. It contended that the city was without power to include these
            sales in the measure of the tax for the coming year. The court held, however, that the
            tax was upon the privilege of manufacturing within the State and it was permissible to
            measure the tax by the sales price of the goods produced rather than by their value at
            the date of manufacture. If the tax there under consideration had been a sales tax the
            city could not have measured it by sales consummated in another State."</p>

            </span>, the payment of a percentage of gross receipts was upheld as a condition of the
            corporate franchise.</p>
         <p>[3] The Court suggests that the fact that similar stevedoring activity will be required
            at the destination creates a risk of multiple taxation, since the State of destination
            would be as free to tax the unloading as New York to tax the loading. This is only
            multiple in the sense that each State taxes what occurs within its borders; the two
            taxes would not be on the same activity. It is no more relevant that stevedoring is
            involved in both cases, than is the fact that two States may impose property taxes on
            terminals or trackage within their respective borders.</p>
         <p>[4] Moreover, the tax in the Philadelphia &amp;amp; Southern S.S. Co. case was
            restricted not only to transportation companies but also to receipts from
            transportation. Those facts were emphasized by Mr. Justice Bradley (122 U.S. pp.
            344-345): "Can the tax in this case be regarded as an income tax? and, if it can, does
            that make any difference as to its constitutionality? We do not think that it can
            properly be regarded as an income tax. It is not a general tax on the incomes of all the
            inhabitants of the state; but a special tax on transportation companies. Conceding,
            however, that an income tax may be imposed on certain classes of the community,
            distinguished by the character of their occupations; this is not an income tax on the
            class to which it refers, but a tax on their receipts for transportation only. Many of
            the companies included in it may, and undoubtedly do, have incomes from other sources,
            such as rents of houses, wharves, stores, and water-power, and interest on moneyed
            investments. As a tax on transportation, we have already seen from the quotations from
            the State Freight Tax Case that it cannot be supported where that transportation is an
            ingredient of interstate or foreign commerce, even though the law imposing the tax be
            expressed in such general terms as to include receipts from transportation which are
            properly taxable. It is unnecessary, therefore, to discuss the question which would
            arise if the tax were properly a tax on income. It is clearly not such, but a tax on
            transportation only." Cf. United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, <span class="citation">
