            <span class="star-pagination">*166</span> John J. Abt argued the cause and filed a brief
            for petitioners.</p>
         <p>Ralph S. Spritzer argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were
            Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Tompkins, Philip R. Monahan and
            Jerome L. Avedon.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*167</span> MR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of
            the Court.</p>
         <p>Petitioners are two of eleven defendants who were convicted in the Southern District of
            New York in 1949 of conspiring to teach and advocate the violent overthrow of the
            Government in violation of the Smith Act, 54 Stat. 670, 671, 18 U. S. C. §§ 371, 2385.
            Their convictions, each carrying a $10,000 fine and five years' imprisonment, were
            affirmed by this Court on June 4, 1951, in Dennis v. United States, 341 U. S. 494. After
            their convictions, petitioners had been enlarged on bail, and following the affirmance,
            the United States Attorney served counsel for the petitioners on June 28, 1951, with
            copies of a proposed order on mandate requiring petitioners to surrender to the United
            States Marshal on July 2 for the execution of their sentences, and with a notice that
            such order would be presented to the District Court for signature on the indicated day
            of surrender. Petitioners were thereupon informed by their counsel that their presence
            in court would be required on July 2. Both, however, disappeared from their homes,
            failed to appear in court when the surrender order was signed on July 2, and remained
            fugitives for more than four and a half years. Ultimately both voluntarily surrendered
            to the United States Marshal in New York, Green on February 27, 1956, and Winston on
            March 5, 1956.</p>
         <p>Shortly thereafter, the United States instituted criminal contempt proceedings against
            the petitioners in the District Court for willful disobedience of the surrender order in
            violation of 18 U. S. C. § 401 (see p. 168, infra). Pursuant to Rule 42 (b) of the
            Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, these proceedings were tried to the court without a
               jury.<span class="sup">[1]</span> Following a hearing, the court found <span
               class="star-pagination">*168</span> petitioners guilty of the contempts charged and
            sentenced each to three years' imprisonment to commence after service of the five-year
            sentences imposed in the conspiracy case. See <span class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">140</span>
               <span class="reporter">F. Supp.</span>
               <span class="page">117</span>
            </span> (opinion as to Green). The Court of Appeals affirmed, 241 F. 2d 631, and we
            granted certiorari because the case presented important issues relating to the scope of
            the power of federal district courts to convict and sentence for criminal contempts. 353
            U. S. 972.</p>
         <p>The petitioners urge four grounds for reversal, namely: (1) the criminal contempt power
            of federal courts does not extend to surrender orders; (2) even if such power exists,
            the evidence was insufficient to support the judgments of contempt; (3) a prison
            sentence for criminal contempt cannot, as a matter of law, exceed one year; and (4) in
            any event the three-year sentences imposed were so excessive as to constitute an abuse
            of discretion on the part of the District Court. For the reasons given hereafter we
            think that none of these contentions can be sustained, and that the judgment of the
            Court of Appeals must be upheld.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I.</h2>
         <p>The contempt judgments rest on 18 U. S. C. § 401, which in pertinent part provides that
            a federal court:</p> ". . . shall have power to punish by fine or imprisonment, at its
         discretion, such contempt of its authority, and none other, as&#x97; ..... "(3)
         Disobedience or resistance to its lawful . . . order . . . ." <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*169</span> Since the order here issued was beyond dispute
            "lawful," § 401 plainly empowered the District Court to punish petitioners for
            disobeying it unless, as petitioners claim, this order is outside the scope of
            subdivision (3). This claim rests on the argument that the statute, viewed in its
            historical context, does not embrace an order requiring the surrender of a bailed
            defendant.</p>
         <p>An evaluation of this argument requires an analysis of the course of development of
            federal statutes relating to criminal contempts. The first statute bearing on the
            contempt powers of federal courts was enacted as § 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1
            Stat. 73, 83. It stated that federal courts "shall have power to . . . punish by fine or
            imprisonment, at the discretion of said courts, all contempts of authority in any cause
            or hearing before the same . . . ." The generality of this language suggests that § 17
            was intended to do no more than expressly attribute to the federal judiciary those
            powers to punish for contempt possessed by English courts at common law. Indeed, this
            Court has itself stated that under § 17 the definition of contempts and the procedure
            for their trial were "left to be determined according to such established rules and
            principles of the common law as were applicable to our situation." Savin, Petitioner,
            131 U. S. 267, 275-276.<span class="sup">[2]</span> At English common law disobedience
            of a writ under the King's seal was early treated as a contempt, 4 Blackstone
            Commentaries 284, 285; Beale, Contempt of Court, 21 Harv. L. Rev. 161, 164-167; Fox, The
            Summary Process to Punish Contempt, 25 L. Q. Rev. 238, 249, and over the centuries
            English courts came to use the <span class="star-pagination">*170</span> King's seal as
            a matter of course as a means of making effective their own process. Beale, at 167. It
            follows that under the Judiciary Act of 1789 the contempt powers of the federal courts
            comprehended the power to punish violations of their own orders.<span class="sup"
               >[3]</span>
         </p>
         <p>So much the petitioners recognize. They point out, however, that, at early English law,
            courts dealt with absconding defendants not by way of contempt, but under the ancient
            doctrine of outlawry, a practice whereby the defendant was summoned by proclamation to
            five successive county courts and, for failure to appear, was declared forfeited of all
            his goods and chattels. 4 Blackstone Commentaries 283, 319. In view of this distinct
            method at English common law of punishing refusal to respond to this summons, which was
            the equivalent of the present surrender order, petitioners argue that § 17 of the
            Judiciary Act of 1789, incorporating English practice, did not reach to a surrender
            order, and that the unique status of such an order subsisted under all statutory
            successors to § 17, including § 401 (3) of the existing contempt statute.</p>
         <p>We find these arguments unconvincing. The reasons for the early English practice of
            proceeding against absconding defendants by way of outlawry rather than by contempt are
            obscure. It may have been that outlawry was resorted to because absconding was regarded
            so seriously as to require the drastic penalties of outlawry rather than fine or
            imprisonment. But whatever the reasons may have been, the fact that English courts
            adhered <span class="star-pagination">*171</span> to the practice of dealing with such
            cases by outlawry should not obscure the general principle that they had power to treat
            willful disobedience of their orders as contempts of court. It is significant that, so
            far as we know, the severe remedy of outlawry, which fell into early disuse in the state
            courts, was never known to the federal law. See United States v. Hall, 198 F. 2d 726,
            727-728. Its unavailability to federal courts, and the absence of any other sanctions
            for the disobedience of surrender orders, are in themselves factors which point away
            from the conclusion that the kind of power traditionally used to assure respect for a
            court's process should be found wanting in this one instance.</p>
         <p>The subsequent development of the federal contempt power lends no support to the
            petitioners' position, for the significance of the Act of 1831, 4 Stat. 487, 488, lies
            quite in the opposite direction. Sentiment for passage of that Act arose out of the
            impeachment proceedings instituted against Judge James H. Peck because of his conviction
            and punishment for criminal contempt of a lawyer who had published an article critical
            of a decision of the judge then on appeal. Although it is true that the Act marks the
            first congressional step to curtail the contempt powers of the federal courts, the
            important thing to note is that the area of curtailment related not to punishment for
            disobedience of court orders but to punishment for conduct of the kind that had provoked
            Judge Peck's controversial action. As to such conduct, the 1831 Act confined the summary
            power of punishment to ". . . misbehaviour of any person . . . in the presence of the .
            . . of justice . . . ." The cases in this Court which have curbed the exercise of the
            contempt power by federal courts have concerned this clause, as found in statutory
            successors to the Act of 1831 including subdivision (1) of present 18 U. S. C. § 401, or
            a further clause in the Act <span class="star-pagination">*172</span> and its successors
            dealing with misbehavior of court "officers," now found in subdivision (2) of §
               401.<span class="sup">[4]</span>
         </p>
         <p>In contrast to the judicial restrictions imposed on the contempt power exercisable under
            the clauses now found in subdivisions (1) and (2) of § 401, we find no case suggesting
            that subdivision (3) of § 401, before us here, is open to any but its obvious meaning.
            This clause also finds its statutory source in the Act of 1831, which first made
            explicit the authority of federal courts to punish for conduct of the kind involved in
            this case by providing that the contempt power should extend to ". . . disobedience or
            resistance . . . to any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command . . ." of
            a federal court. Particularly in the absence of any showing that the old practice of
            outlawry was ever brought to the attention of Congress, there is no warrant for
            engrafting upon this unambiguous clause a dubious exception to the English contempt
            power stemming from this practice. Although the 1831 Act no doubt incorporated many of
            the concepts of the English common law, its legislative history indicates that Congress
            sought to define independently the contempt powers of federal courts rather than to have
            the Act simply reflect all the oddities of early English practice. The House Committee
            which reported the bill had been directed "to inquire into the expediency of defining by
            statute all offences which may be punished as contempts of . . ." federal courts. 7
            Cong. Deb., 21st Cong., 2d Sess. (Gale's &amp;amp; Seaton's Reg.), pp. 560-561. (Italics
            added.) See Frankfurter and Landis, Power to Regulate Contempts, 37 Harv. L. Rev. 1010,
            1024-1028.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*173</span> Entirely apart from the historical argument,
            there are no reasons of policy suggesting a need for limitation of the contempt power in
            this situation. As the present cases evidence, the issuance of a bench warrant and the
            forfeiture of bail following flight have generally proved inadequate to dissuade
            defendants from defying court orders. See Willoughby, Principles of Judicial
            Administration (1929), 561-566. At the time these contempts were committed bail-jumping
            itself was not a criminal offense, and considerations in past decisions limiting the
            scope of the contempt power where the conduct deemed to constitute a contempt was also
            punishable as a substantive crime are not here relevant. Cf. Ex parte Hudgings, 249 U.
            S. 378, 382. There is small justification for permitting a defendant the assurance that
            his only risk in disobeying a surrender order is the forfeiture of a known sum of money,
            particularly when such forfeiture may result in injury only to a bail surety.</p>
         <p>It may be true, as petitioners state, that this case and those of the other absconding
            Dennis defendants, United States v. Thompson, 214 F. 2d 545; United States v. Hall, 198
            F. 2d 726, provide the first instances where a federal court has exercised the contempt
            power for disobedience of a surrender order. But the power to punish for willful
            disobedience of a court order, once found to exist, cannot be said to have atrophied by
            disuse in this particular instance. Indeed, when Congress in 1954 made bail-jumping a
            crime in 18 U. S. C. § 3146, it expressly preserved the contempt power in this very
            situation. We find support in neither history nor policy to carve out so singular an
            exception from the clear meaning of § 401 (3).</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II.</h2>
         <p>Petitioners contend that the evidence was insufficient to support their contempt
            convictions, in that it failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt their knowledge
               <span class="star-pagination">*174</span> of the existence of the surrender order.
            The Court of Appeals did not address itself to this contention, considering the issue
            foreclosed by its prior decisions in the Thompson and Hall cases, supra, where the
            evidence as to those other two Dennis defendants who were convicted of similar criminal
            contempts was identical with that involved here, except as to the circumstances of their
            ultimate apprehension.</p>
         <p>In this Court, petitioners interpret the District Court's opinion to rest the contempt
            convictions on alternative theories: (a) that the petitioners had actual knowledge of
            the issuance of the July 2 surrender order, or (b) that they at least had notice of its
            prospective issuance and hence were chargeable with knowledge that it was in fact
            issued. But we find no such dual aspect to the District Court's decision, which rested
            solely on findings that, beyond a reasonable doubt, Green "knowingly disobeyed" the
            surrender order and Winston absented himself "with knowledge" of the order. Since we are
            satisfied that the record supports these findings, we need not consider whether mere
            notice of the prospective issuance of the order, cf. Pettibone v. United States, 148 U.
            S. 197, 206-207, would be sufficient to sustain these convictions on the theory that
            petitioners were chargeable as a matter of law with notice that it was later issued.</p>
         <p>The evidence for the Government, there being none offered by the defense, related to
            three time intervals: (1) the period up to June 28, 1951; (2) the four-day interval
            between June 28, when the proposed surrender order was served on counsel with the notice
            of settlement, and July 2, when the surrender order was signed; and (3) the period
            ending with the surrender of the petitioners&#x97; February 27, 1956, in the case of
            Green, and March 5, 1956, in the case of Winston.</p>
         <p>1. The judgments of conviction upon the conspiracy indictment under the Smith Act were
            entered, and the <span class="star-pagination">*175</span> petitioners were sentenced,
            on October 21, 1949. On November 2, 1949, the Court of Appeals admitted the petitioners
            to bail pending appeal upon separate recognizances, signed by each petitioner on
            November 3, by which each undertook, among other things, to</p> "surrender himself in
         execution of the judgment and sentence appealed from upon such day as the District Court of
         the United States for the Southern District of New York may direct, if the judgment and
         sentence appealed from shall be affirmed . . . ." (Italics added.) <p>Following the Court
            of Appeals' affirmance of the conspiracy convictions on August 1, 1950, 183 F. 2d 201,
            Mr. Justice Jackson, as Circuit Justice, continued petitioners' bail on September 25,
            1950, pending review of the convictions by this Court. 184 F. 2d 280. This Court, as
            noted above, affirmed the conspiracy convictions on June 4, 1951, and on June 22, 1951,
            Mr. Justice Jackson denied a stay of the Court's mandate.</p>
         <p>2. On Thursday, June 28, 1951, one of the counsel in the Dennis case accepted service on
            behalf of all the defendants, including petitioners, of a proposed order on mandate
            requiring the defendants to "personally surrender to the United States Marshal for the
            Southern District of New York . . . on the 2nd day of July, 1951, at 11:05" a. m.,
            together with a notice stating that the proposed order would be presented to the
            District Court "for settlement and signature" at 10 a. m. on that day.<span class="sup"
               >[5]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*176</span> It appears from the testimony of this same
            counsel and another Dennis counsel that on the following day, Friday, June 29, an
            unsuccessful request was made to the United States Attorney and the District Court to
            postpone the defendants' surrender until after the July 4 holiday; that on the same day
            these lawyers told the petitioners and the other Dennis defendants that they must be in
            court on Monday, July 2; and that petitioners assured counsel of their appearance on
            that day.<span class="sup">[6]</span> On <span class="star-pagination">*177</span> July
            2 all of the Dennis defendants surrendered, except the two petitioners, and Hall and
            Thompson. The surrender order was signed, bench warrants were issued for the arrest of
            these four, and the proceedings were adjourned to the following day, July 3.</p>
         <p>3. On July 3 the names of the petitioners were called again in open court, and after
            interrogating counsel as to their disappearance (see note 6, supra), the court declared
            their bail forfeited. The petitioners remained in hiding until their eventual surrender,
            some four and a half years later. Prior to their respective surrenders in February and
            March, 1956, Green and Winston issued press releases announcing their intention to
            surrender and "enter prison."<span class="sup">[7]</span> When he turned up on the steps
            of the <span class="star-pagination">*178</span> courthouse, Green also responded to
            certain questions put by reporters and stated, among other things, that he intended "to
            go to the United States Marshal's office," this being a requirement found only in the
            surrender order itself. Winston made a similar statement in his press release.</p>
         <p>In summary, one day after counsel was served on June 28 with the proposed order calling
            for petitioners' surrender on July 2, together with the notice stating that the order
            would also be presented for the court's signature on that day, petitioners were
            unequivocally notified by counsel that their presence in court was required on July 2.
            From these undisputed facts, coupled with petitioners' disappearance, it was certainly
            permissible for the District Court to infer that petitioners knew of the proposed
            surrender order, of the failure of counsel's efforts on June 29 to postpone the
            surrender date, and of the court's intention to sign the order on July 2. We need not
            decide whether these facts alone would sustain the finding that petitioners knew of the
            issuance of the surrender order on July 2 as planned, for unquestionably as background
            they furnished significant support for the District Court's ultimate finding that
            petitioners' statements to the press at the time of their eventual surrender in 1956
            (see note 7, supra) indicated their knowledge of the issuance of the order, a finding
            strengthened by the fact that the recognizance admitting the petitioners to bail
            obligated petitioners to surrender for service of sentence only when so directed by the
            District Court.</p>
         <p>No doubt some of this evidence lent itself to conflicting inferences, but those
            favorable to the petitioners were, in our view, not of such strength as to compel the
            trier of <span class="star-pagination">*179</span> the facts to reject alternative
            unfavorable inferences. Our duty as an appellate court is to assess the evidence as a
            whole under the rigorous standards governing criminal trials, rather than to test by
            those standards each item of evidence relied on by the District Court. 9 Wigmore,
            Evidence (3d ed. 1940), § 2497; 1 Wharton, Criminal Evidence (12th ed. 1955), § 16. So
            viewing the entire record, we think the District Court was justified in finding that the
            evidence established, beyond a reasonable doubt, petitioners' knowing violations of the
            surrender order.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III.</h2>
         <p>We deal here with petitioners' claim that the District Court was without power to
            sentence them to imprisonment for more than one year.</p>
         <p>Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 confirmed the power of federal courts ". . . to
            punish by fine or imprisonment, at the discretion of said courts . . ." certain
            contempts. The Act of 1831 simply referred to the power to "inflict summary
            punishments," and present § 401 contains substantially the above language of the Act of
            1789. Petitioners contend that despite the provision for "discretion," the power to
            punish under § 401 is limited to one year by certain sections of the Clayton Act of
            1914, 38 Stat. 730, 738-740. In any event, we are urged to read such a limitation into §
            401 in order to avoid constitutional difficulties which, it is said, would otherwise
            confront us.</p>
         <p>We turn first to the argument based on the Clayton Act. Sections 21 and 22 of that Act
            provided that certain rights not traditionally accorded persons charged with contempt,
            notably the right to trial by jury, should be granted in certain classes of criminal
            contempts, and that persons tried under these procedures were not subject to a fine of
            more than $1,000 or imprisonment for longer <span class="star-pagination">*180</span>
            than six months.<span class="sup">[8]</span> Section 24 of the Act made these provisions
            inapplicable to other categories of contempts, including the contempt for which the
            petitioners here have been convicted,<span class="sup">[9]</span> and provided that such
            excluded categories of contempts were to be punished "in conformity to the usages at law
            and in equity now prevailing." (Italics added.) In the recodification of 1948 the
            foregoing provisions of the Clayton Act were substantially re-enacted in § 402<span
               class="sup">[10]</span> of the present contempt statute, and the above-quoted clause
            now reads: "in conformity to the prevailing usages at law."</p>
         <p>Petitioners' argument is that the purpose and effect of the "usages . . . now
            prevailing" language of § 24 of the Clayton Act was to freeze into federal contempt law
            the sentencing practices of federal courts, which up to that time appear never to have
            imposed a contempt sentence of more than one year.<span class="sup">[11]</span> These
            practices, suggest petitioners, <span class="star-pagination">*181</span> reflect the
            unarticulated belief of federal courts that criminal contempts are not infamous crimes
            and hence not subject to punishment by imprisonment for over one year;<span class="sup"
               >[12]</span> this belief is said to derive from the constitutional considerations to
            which we shortly turn. In view of this suggested effect of § 24, petitioners would have
            us read the "discretion" vested in federal courts by § 401 as referring exclusively to
            the choice between sentencing to fine or imprisonment, or in any event as subject to the
            unexpressed limitation of one year's imprisonment.</p>
         <p>Particularly in the context of the rest of the Clayton Act of 1914 we cannot read the
            "usages . . . now prevailing" clause of § 24 as incorporating into the statute the
            sentencing practices up to that date. In § 22 the statute specifically restricts to six
            months the maximum term of imprisonment which may be imposed for commission of any of
            the contempts described in § 21. Had Congress also intended to restrict the term of
            imprisonment for contempts excluded from the operation of the Act by § 24, it is
            difficult to understand why it did not make explicit its intention, as it did in § 22,
            rather than so subtly express its purpose by proceeding in the devious manner attributed
            to it by the petitioners. Further, there is no evidence that the past sentencing
            practices of the courts were ever brought to the attention of Congress. That the federal
            courts themselves have not considered their sentencing power to be restricted by § 24 of
            the Clayton Act or by § 402 of the present contempt statute is indicated by the fact
            that in at least nine cases subsequent to 1914, contempt convictions carrying sentences
            of more than <span class="star-pagination">*182</span> one year have been affirmed by
            four different Courts of Appeals and on one occasion by this Court.<span class="sup"
               >[13]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Such of the legislative history as is germane here argues against the petitioners and
            strengthens our conclusions that the "usages . . . now prevailing" clause of § 24 of the
            Clayton Act did no more than emphasize that contempts other than those specified in § 21
            were to be tried under familiar contempt procedures, that is, among other things, by the
            court rather than a jury. The House Report accompanying the bill which was substantially
            enacted as §§ 21, 22 and 24 of the Clayton Act referred to the provisions later forming
            these sections as dealing ". . . entirely with questions of Federal procedure relating
            to injunctions and contempts committed without the presence of the court." H. R. Rep.
            No. 627, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. 21. There is no evidence of a broader purpose to enact so
            substantial a rule of substantive law encompassing all criminal contempts.</p>
         <p>We are nevertheless urged to read into § 401 a one-year limitation on the sentencing
            power in order to avoid constitutional issues which the petitioners deem present in the
            absence of such a restriction. But in view of what we have shown, the section's
            provision that a federal court may punish "at its discretion" the enumerated classes of
            contempts cannot reasonably be read to allow a court merely the choice between fines and
            imprisonment. We think the Court of Appeals correctly said: "The phrase `at its
            discretion.' does not mean that the court <span class="star-pagination">*183</span> must
            choose between fine and imprisonment; the word `or,' itself provides as much and the
            words, if so construed, would have been redundant. The term of imprisonment is to be as
            much in the court's discretion as the fine." 241 F. 2d, at 634.</p>
         <p>We therefore turn to petitioners' constitutional arguments. The claim is that
            proceedings for criminal contempts, if contempts are subject to prison terms of more
            than one year, must be based on grand jury indictments under the clause of the Fifth
            Amendment providing: "No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise
            infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury . . . ." (Italics
            added.) Since an "infamous crime" within the meaning of the Amendment is one punishable
            by imprisonment in a penitentiary, Mackin v. United States, 117 U. S. 348, and since
            imprisonment in a penitentiary can be imposed only if a crime is subject to imprisonment
            exceeding one year, 18 U. S. C. § 4083, petitioners assert that criminal contempts if
            subject to such punishment are infamous crimes under the Amendment.</p>
         <p>But this assertion cannot be considered in isolation from the general status of
            contempts under the Constitution, whether subject to "infamous" punishment or not. The
            statements of this Court in a long and unbroken line of decisions involving contempts
            ranging from misbehavior in court to disobedience of court orders establish beyond
            peradventure that criminal contempts are not subject to jury trial as a matter of
            constitutional right.<span class="sup">[14]</span>
            <span class="star-pagination">*184</span> Although appearing to recognize this,
            petitioners nevertheless point out that punishment for criminal contempts cannot in any
            practical sense be distinguished from punishment for substantive crimes, see Gompers v.
            United States, 233 U. S. 604, 610, and that contempt proceedings have traditionally been
            surrounded with many of the protections available in a criminal trial.<span class="sup"
               >[15]</span> But this Court has never suggested that such protections included the
            right to grand jury indictment. Cf. Savin, Petitioner, 131 U. S. 267, 278; Gompers v.
            United States, supra, at 612. And of course the summary procedures followed by English
            courts prior to adoption of the Constitution in dealing with many contempts of court did
            not embrace the use of either grand or petit jury. See 4 Blackstone Commentaries
            283-287. It would indeed be anomalous to conclude that contempts subject to sentences of
            imprisonment for over one year are "infamous <span class="star-pagination">*185</span>
            crimes" under the Fifth Amendment although they are neither "crimes" nor "criminal
            prosecutions" for the purpose of jury trial within the meaning of Art. III, § 2,<span
               class="sup">[16]</span> and the Sixth Amendment.<span class="sup">[17]</span>
         </p>
         <p>We are told however that the decisions of this Court denying the right to jury trial in
            criminal contempt proceedings are based upon an "historical error" reflecting a
            misunderstanding as to the scope of the power of English courts at the early common law
            to try summarily for contempts, and that this error should not here be extended to a
            denial of the right to grand jury. But the more recent historical research into English
            contempt practices predating the adoption of our Constitution reveals no such clear
            error and indicates if anything that the precise nature of those practices is shrouded
            in much obscurity. And whatever the breadth of the historical error said by contemporary
            scholarship to have been committed by English courts of the late Seventeenth and
            Eighteenth Centuries in their interpretation of English precedents involving the trials
            of contempts of court, it at least seems clear that English practice by the early
            Eighteenth Century comprehended the use of summary powers of conviction by courts to
            punish for a variety of contempts committed within and outside court.<span class="sup"
               >[18]</span> Such indeed is the <span class="star-pagination">*186</span> statement
            of English law of this period found in Blackstone, supra, p. 184, who explicitly
            recognized use of a summary power by English courts to deal with disobedience of court
            process. It is noteworthy that the Judiciary Act of 1789, first attempting a definition
            of the contempt power, was enacted by a Congress with a Judiciary Committee including
            members of the recent Constitutional Convention, who no doubt shared the prevailing
            views in the American Colonies of English law as expressed in Blackstone. See Ex parte
            Burr, 4 Fed. Cas. 791, 797 (No. 2,186). Against this historical background, this Court
            has never deviated from the view that the constitutional guarantee of trial by jury for
            "crimes" and "criminal prosecutions" was not intended to reach to criminal contempts.
            And indeed beginning with the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress has <span
               class="star-pagination">*187</span> consistently preserved the summary nature of the
            contempt power in the Act of 1831 and its statutory successors, departing from this
            traditional notion only in specific instances where it has provided for jury trial for
            certain categories of contempt.<span class="sup">[19]</span>

         <p>We do not write upon a clean slate. The principle that criminal contempts of court are
            not required to be tried by a jury under Article III or the Sixth Amendment is firmly
            rooted in our traditions. Indeed, the petitioners themselves have not contended that
            they were entitled to a jury trial. By the same token it is clear that criminal
            contempts, although subject, as we have held, to sentences of imprisonment exceeding one
            year, need not be prosecuted by indictment under the Fifth Amendment. In various
            respects, such as the absence of a statutory limitation of the amount of a fine or the
            length of a prison sentence which may be imposed for their commission, criminal
            contempts have always differed from the usual statutory crime under federal law. As to
            trial by jury and indictment by grand jury, they possess a unique character under the
               Constitution.<span class="sup">[20]</span>
         </p>
         <p/>
         <h2>IV.</h2>
         <p>Petitioners contend that the three-year sentences imposed upon them constituted an abuse
            of discretion on the part of the District Court.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*188</span> We take this occasion to reiterate our view
            that in the areas where Congress has not seen fit to impose limitations on the
            sentencing power for contempts the district courts have a special duty to exercise such
            an extraordinary power with the utmost sense of responsibility and circumspection. The
            "discretion" to punish vested in the District Courts by § 401 is not an unbridled
            discretion. Appellate courts have here a special responsibility for determining that the
            power is not abused, to be exercised if necessary by revising themselves the sentences
            imposed. This Court has in past cases taken pains to emphasize its concern with the use
            to which the sentencing power has occasionally been put, both by remanding for
            reconsideration of contempt sentences in light of factors it deemed important, see Yates
            v. United States, 355 U. S. 66; Nilva v. United States, 352 U. S. 385, and by itself
            modifying such sentences. See United States v. United Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258. The
            answer to those who see in the contempt power a potential instrument of oppression lies
            in assurance of its careful use and supervision, not in imposition of artificial
            limitations on the power.</p>
         <p>It is in this light that we have considered the claim that the sentences here were so
            excessive as to amount to an abuse of discretion. We are led to reject the claim under
            the facts of this case for three reasons. First, the contempt here was by any standards
            a most egregious one. Petitioners had been accorded a fair trial on the conspiracy
            charges against them and had been granted bail pending review of their convictions by
            the Court of Appeals and this Court. Nevertheless they absconded, and over four and a
            half years of hiding culminated not in a belated recognition of the authority of the
            court, but in petitioners' reassertion of justification for disobeying the surrender
            order. Second, comparing these sentences with those imposed on the other fugitives in
            the Dennis <span class="star-pagination">*189</span> case, the sentences here are
            shorter by a year than that upheld in the Thompson case, and no longer than that
            inflicted in the Hall case. It is true that Hall and Thompson were apprehended, but the
            record shows that the District Court took into account the fact that the surrender of
            these petitioners was voluntary; there is the further factor that the period during
            which petitioners remained fugitives was longer than that in either the Hall or Thompson
            case. Third, the sentences were well within the maximum five-year imprisonment for
            bail-jumping provided now by 18 U. S. C. § 3146, a statute in which Congress saw fit
            expressly to preserve the contempt power without enacting any limitation on contempt
            sentences.</p>
         <p>In these circumstances we cannot say that the sentences imposed were beyond the bounds
            of the reasonable exercise of the District Court's discretion.</p>
         <p>Affirmed.</p></div>
      <div type="concurrence" judge="frankfurter">
         <p>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring.</p>
         <p>In joining the Court's opinion I deem it appropriate to add a few observations. Law is a
            social organism, and evolution operates in the sociological domain no less than in the
            biological. The vitality and therefore validity of law is not arrested by the
            circumstances of its origin. What Magna Carta has become is very different indeed from
            the immediate objects of the barons at Runnymede. The fact that scholarship has shown
            that historical assumptions regarding the procedure for punishment of contempt of court
            were ill-founded, hardly wipes out a century and a half of the legislative and judicial
            history of federal law based on such assumptions. Moreover, the most authoritative
            student of the history of contempt of court has impressively shown that "from the reign
            of Edward I it was established that the Court had power to punish summarily contempt
            committed . . . in the actual view of the Court." Fox, History of Contempt of Court,
            49-52.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*190</span> Whatever the conflicting views of scholars in
            construing more or less dubious manuscripts of the Fourteenth Century, what is
            indisputable is that from the foundation of the United States the constitutionality of
            the power to punish for contempt without the intervention of a jury has not been
            doubted. The First Judiciary Act conferred such a power on the federal courts in the
            very act of their establishment, 1 Stat. 73, 83, and of the Judiciary Committee of eight
            that reported the bill to the Senate, five members including the chairman, Senator,
            later to be Chief Justice, Ellsworth, had been delegates to the Constitutional
               Convention.<span class="sup">[1]</span> In the First Congress itself no less than
            nineteen members, including Madison who contemporaneously introduced the Bill of Rights,
            had been delegates to the Convention. And when an abuse under this power manifested
            itself, and led Congress to define more explicitly the summary power vested in the
            courts, it did not remotely deny the existence of the power but merely defined the
            conditions for its exercise more clearly, in an Act "declaratory of the law concerning
            contempts of court." Act of Mar. 2, 1831, 4 Stat. 487. Although the judge who had
            misused the power was impeached, and Congress defined the power more clearly, neither
            the proponents of the reform nor Congress in its corrective legislation suggested that
            the established law be changed by making the jury part of the procedure for the
            punishment of criminal contempt. This is more significant in that such a proposal had
            only recently been put before Congress as part of the draft penal code of Edward
            Livingston of Louisiana.</p>
         <p>Nor has the constitutionality of the power been doubted by this Court throughout its
            existence. In at least two score cases in this Court, not to mention the vast mass of
               <span class="star-pagination">*191</span> decisions in the lower federal courts, the
            power to punish summarily has been accepted without question.<span class="sup"
               >[2]</span> It is <span class="star-pagination">*192</span> relevant to call the roll
            of the Justices, not including those now sitting, who thus sustained the exercise of
            this power:</p> Washington Gray Pitney Marshall Blatchford McReynolds Johnson L. Q. C.

         Matthews J. R. Lamar <p>To be sure, it is never too late for this Court to correct a
            misconception in an occasional decision, even on a rare occasion to change a rule of law
            that may have long persisted but also have long been questioned and only fluctuatingly
            applied. To say that everybody on the Court <span class="star-pagination">*193</span>
            has been wrong for 150 years and that that which has been deemed part of the bone and
            sinew of the law should now be extirpated is quite another thing. Decision-making is not
            a mechanical process, but neither is this Court an originating lawmaker. The admonition
            of Mr. Justice Brandeis that we are not a third branch of the Legislature should never
            be disregarded. Congress has seen fit from time to time to qualify the power of summary
            punishment for contempt that it gave the federal courts in 1789 by requiring in
            explicitly defined situations that a jury be associated with the court in determining
            whether there has been a contempt. See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. § 3691; Civil Rights Act of
            1957, 71 Stat. 634, 638, 42 U. S. C. A. § 1995. It is for Congress to extend this
            participation of the jury, whenever it sees fit to do so, to other instances of the
            exercise of the power to punish for contempt. It is not for this Court to fashion a
            wholly novel constitutional doctrine that would require such participation whatever
            Congress may think on the matter, and in the teeth of an unbroken legislative and
            judicial history from the foundation of the Nation.<span class="sup">[4]</span>

      <div type="dissent" judge="black">
         <p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concur,
            dissenting.</p>
         <p>The power of a judge to inflict punishment for criminal contempt by means of a summary
            proceeding stands as an anomaly in the law.<span class="sup">[1]</span> In my judgment
            the time has <span class="star-pagination">*194</span> come for a fundamental and
            searching reconsideration of the validity of this power which has aptly been
            characterized by a State Supreme Court as, "perhaps, nearest akin to despotic power of
            any power existing under our form of government."<span class="sup">[2]</span> Even
            though this extraordinary authority first slipped into the law as a very limited and
            insignificant thing, it has relentlessly swollen, at the hands of not unwilling judges,
            until it has become a drastic and pervasive mode of administering criminal justice
            usurping our regular constitutional methods of trying those charged with offenses
            against society. Therefore to me this case involves basic questions of the highest
            importance far transcending its particular facts. But the specific facts do provide a
            striking example of how the great procedural safeguards erected by the Bill of Rights
            are now easily evaded by the ever-ready and boundless expedients of a judicial decree
            and a summary contempt proceeding.</p>
         <p>I would reject those precedents which have held that the federal courts can punish an
            alleged violation outside the courtroom of their decrees by means of a summary trial, at
            least as long as they can punish by severe prison sentences or fines as they now can and
               do.<span class="sup">[3]</span> I <span class="star-pagination">*195</span> would
            hold that the defendants here were entitled to be tried by a jury after indictment by a
            grand jury and in full accordance with all the procedural safeguards required by the
            Constitution for "all criminal prosecutions." I am convinced that the previous cases to
            the contrary are wrong&#x97;wholly wrong for reasons which I shall set out in this
            opinion.</p>
         <p>Ordinarily it is sound policy to adhere to prior decisions but this practice has quite
            properly never been a blind, inflexible rule. Courts are not omniscient. Like every
            other human agency, they too can profit from trial and error, from experience and
            reflection. As others have demonstrated, the principle commonly referred to as stare
            decisis has never been thought to extend so far as to prevent the courts from correcting
            their own errors. Accordingly, this Court has time and time again from the very
            beginning reconsidered the merits of its earlier decisions even though they claimed
            great longevity and repeated reaffirmation. See, e. g., Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins,
            304 U. S. 64; Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466; Nye v. United States,
            313 U. S. 33.<span class="sup">[4]</span> Indeed, the Court has a special responsibility
            where questions of constitutional law are involved to review its decisions from time to
            time and where compelling reasons present themselves to refuse to follow erroneous
            precedents; otherwise its mistakes in interpreting the Constitution are extremely
            difficult to alleviate and needlessly so. See Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp;amp; Gas Co.,
            285 U. S. 393, 405 <span class="star-pagination">*196</span> (Brandeis, J., dissenting);
            Douglas, Stare Decisis, 49 Col. L. Rev. 735.</p>
         <p>If ever a group of cases called for reappraisal it seems to me that those approving
            summary trial of charges of criminal contempt are the ones. The early precedents which
            laid the groundwork for this line of authorities were decided before the actual history
            of the procedures used to punish contempt was brought to light, at a time when "[w]holly
            unfounded assumptions about `immemorial usage' acquired a factitious authority and were
            made the basis of legal decisions."<span class="sup">[5]</span> These cases erroneously
            assumed that courts had always possessed the power to punish all contempts summarily and
            that it inhered in their very being without supporting their suppositions by authority
            or reason. Later cases merely cite the earlier ones in a progressive cumulation while
            uncritically repeating their assumptions about "immemorial usage" and "inherent
               necessity."<span class="sup">[6]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*197</span> No justified expectations would be destroyed
            by the course I propose. There has been no heavy investment in reliance on the earlier
            cases; they do not remotely lay down rules to guide men in their commercial or property
            affairs. Instead they concern the manner in which persons are to be tried by the
            Government for their alleged crimes. Certainly in this area there is no excuse for the
            perpetuation of past errors, particularly errors of great continuing importance with
            ominous potentialities. Apparently even the majority recognizes the need for some kind
            of reform by engrafting the requirement that punishment for contempt must be
            "reasonable"&#x97;that irrepressible, vague and delusive standard which at times
            threatens to engulf the entire law, including the Constitution itself, in a sea of
            judicial discretion.<span class="sup">[7]</span> But this trifling amelioration does not
            strike at the heart of the problem and can easily come to nothing, as the majority's
            very approval of the grossly disproportionate sentences imposed on these defendants
            portends.</p>
         <p>Before going any further, perhaps it should be emphasized that we are not at all
            concerned with the power of courts to impose conditional imprisonment for the purpose of
            compelling a person to obey a valid order. Such coercion, where the defendant carries
            the keys to freedom in his willingness to comply with the court's directive, is
            essentially a civil remedy designed for the benefit of other parties and has quite
            properly been exercised for centuries to secure compliance with judicial decrees. See
            United States v. United Mine Workers of America, 330 <span class="star-pagination"
               >*198</span> U. S. 258, 330-332 (dissenting and concurring opinion). Instead, at
            stake here is the validity of a criminal conviction for disobedience of a court order
            punished by a long, fixed term of imprisonment. In my judgment the distinction between
            conditional confinement to compel future performance and unconditional imprisonment
            designed to punish past transgressions is crucial, analytically as well as historically,
            in determining the permissible mode of trial under the Constitution.</p>
         <p>Summary trial of criminal contempt, as now practiced, allows a single functionary of the
            state, a judge, to lay down the law, to prosecute those who he believes have violated
            his command (as interpreted by him), to sit in "judgment" on his own charges, and then
            within the broadest kind of bounds to punish as he sees fit. It seems inconsistent with
            the most rudimentary principles of our system of criminal justice, a system carefully
            developed and preserved throughout the centuries to prevent oppressive enforcement of
            oppressive laws, to concentrate this much power in the hands of any officer of the
            state. No official, regardless of his position or the purity and nobleness of his
            character, should be granted such autocratic omnipotence. Indeed if any other officer
            were presumptuous enough to claim such power I cannot believe the courts would tolerate
            it for an instant under the Constitution. Judges are not essentially different from
            other government officials. Fortunately they remain human even after assuming their
            judicial duties. Like all the rest of mankind they may be affected from time to time by
            pride and passion, by pettiness and bruised feelings, by improper understanding or by
            excessive zeal. Frank recognition of these common human characteristics, as well as
            others which need not be mentioned, undoubtedly led to the determination of those who
            formed our Constitution to fragment power, especially the power to define and enforce
            the criminal law, among different <span class="star-pagination">*199</span> departments
            and institutions of government in the hope that each would tend to operate as a check on
            the activities of the others and a shield against their excesses thereby securing the
            people's liberty.</p>
         <p>When the responsibilities of lawmaker, prosecutor, judge, jury and disciplinarian are
            thrust upon a judge he is obviously incapable of holding the scales of justice perfectly
            fair and true and reflecting impartially on the guilt or innocence of the accused.<span
               class="sup">[8]</span> He truly becomes the judge of his own cause. The defendant
            charged with criminal contempt is thus denied what I had always thought to be an
            indispensable element of due process of law&#x97;an objective, scrupulously impartial
            tribunal to determine whether he is guilty or innocent of the charges filed against him.
            In the words of this Court: "A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of
            due process. Fairness of course requires an absence of actual bias in the trial of
            cases. But our system of law has always endeavored to prevent even the probability of
            unfairness. To this end no man can be a judge in his own case and no man is permitted to
            try cases where he has an interest in the outcome.. . . Fair trials are too important a
            part of our free society to let prosecuting judges be trial judges of the charges they
            prefer." In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133, 136-137. Cf. Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S.
            227, 236-237; Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510; In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257.</p>
         <p>The vices of a summary trial are only aggravated by the fact that the judge's power to
            punish criminal contempt is exercised without effective external restraint. First, the
            substantive scope of the offense of contempt is inordinately <span
               class="star-pagination">*200</span> sweeping and vague; it has been defined, for
            example, as "any conduct that tends to bring the authority and administration of the law
            into disrespect or disregard."<span class="sup">[9]</span> It would be no overstatement
            therefore to say that the offense with the most ill-defined and elastic contours in our
            law is now punished by the harshest procedures known to that law. Secondly, a
            defendant's principal assurance that he will be fairly tried and punished is the largely
            impotent review of a cold record by an appellate court, another body of judges. Once in
            a great while a particular appellate tribunal basically hostile to summary proceedings
            will closely police contempt trials but such supervision is only isolated and fleeting.
            All too often the reviewing courts stand aside readily with the formal declaration that
            "the trial judge has not abused his discretion." But even at its rare best appellate
            review cannot begin to take the place of trial in the first instance by an impartial
            jury subject to review on the spot by an uncommitted trial judge. Finally, as the law
            now stands there are no limits on the punishment a judge can impose on a defendant whom
            he finds guilty of contempt except for whatever remote restrictions exist in the Eighth
            Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments or in the nebulous
            requirements of "reasonableness" now promulgated by the majority.</p>
         <p>In my view the power of courts to punish criminal contempt by summary trial, as now
            exercised, is precisely the kind of arbitrary and dangerous power which our forefathers
            both here and abroad fought so long, so bitterly, to stamp out. And the paradox of it
            all is that the courts were established and are maintained to provide impartial
            tribunals of strictly disinterested arbiters to resolve charges of wrongdoing between
            citizen and citizen or citizen and state.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*201</span> The Constitution and Bill of Rights declare in
            sweeping unequivocal terms that "The Trial of all Crimes . . . shall be by Jury," that
            "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public
            trial, by an impartial jury," and that "No person shall be held to answer for a capital,
            or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury." As
            it may now be punished criminal contempt is manifestly a crime by every relevant test of
            reason or history. It was always a crime at common law punishable as such in the regular
            course of the criminal law.<span class="sup">[10]</span> It possesses all of the
            earmarks commonly attributed to a crime. A mandate of the Government has allegedly been
            violated for which severe punishment, including long prison sentences, may be
            exacted&#x97;punishment aimed at chastising the violator for his disobedience.<span
               class="sup">[11]</span> As Mr. Justice Holmes irrefutably observed for the Court in
            Gompers v. United States, 233 U. S. 604, at 610-611: "These contempts are infractions of
            the law, visited with punishment as such. If such acts are not criminal, we are in error
            as to the most fundamental characteristic of crimes as that word has been understood in
            English speech. So truly are they crimes that it seems to be proved that in the early
            law they were punished only <span class="star-pagination">*202</span> by the usual
            criminal procedure . . . and that at least in England it seems that they still may be
            and preferably are tried in that way."<span class="sup">[12]</span>
         </p>
         <p>This very case forcefully illustrates the point. After surrendering the defendants were
            charged with fleeing from justice, convicted, and given lengthy prison sentences
            designed to punish them for their flight. Identical flight has now been made a statutory
            crime by the Congress with severe penalties.<span class="sup">[13]</span> How can it
            possibly be any more of a crime to be convicted of disobeying a statute and sent to jail
            for three years than to be found guilty of violating a judicial decree forbidding
            precisely the same conduct and imprisoned for the same term?</p>
         <p>The claim has frequently been advanced that courts have exercised the power to try all
            criminal contempts summarily since time immemorial and that this mode of trial was so
            well established and so favorably regarded at the time the Constitution was adopted that
            it was carried forward intact, by implication, despite the express provisions of the
            Bill of Rights requiring a completely different and fairer kind of trial for "all
            crimes." The myth of immemorial usage has been exploded by recent scholarship as a mere
            fiction. Instead it seems clear that until at least the late Seventeenth or early
            Eighteenth Century the English courts, with the sole exception of the extraordinary and
            ill-famed Court of Star Chamber whose arbitrary procedures and gross excesses brought
            forth many of <span class="star-pagination">*203</span> the safeguards included in our
            Constitution, neither had nor claimed power to punish contempts committed out of court
            by summary process. Fox, The History of Contempt of Court; Frankfurter and Landis, Power
            to Regulate Contempts, 37 Harv. L. Rev. 1010, 1042-1052; Beale, Contempt of Court,
            Criminal and Civil, 21 Harv. L. Rev. 161. Prior to this period such contempts were tried
            in the normal and regular course of the criminal law, including trial by jury.<span
               class="sup">[14]</span> After the Star Chamber was abolished in 1641 the summary
            contempt procedures utilized by that odious instrument of tyranny slowly began to seep
            into the common-law courts where they were embraced by judges not averse to enhancing
            their own power. Still for decades the instances where such irregular procedures were
            actually applied remained few and far between and limited to certain special
            situations.</p>
         <p>Then in 1765 Justice Wilmot declared in an opinion prepared for delivery in the Court of
            King's Bench (but never actually handed down) that courts had exercised the power to try
            all contempts summarily since their creation in the forgotten past. Although this bald
            assertion has been wholly discredited by the painstaking research of the eminent
            authorities referred to above, and even though Wilmot's opinion was not published until
            some years after our Constitution had been adopted, nor cited as authority by any court
            until 1821, his views have nevertheless exerted a baleful influence on the law of
            contempt both in this country and in England. <span class="star-pagination">*204</span>
            By the middle of the last century the English courts had come to accept fully his thesis
            that they inherently possessed power to punish all contempts summarily, in or out of
            court. Yet even then contempts were often punished by the regular criminal procedures so
            that this Court could report as late as 1913 that they were still preferably tried in
            that manner. Gompers v. United States, 233 U. S. 604, 611.<span class="sup">[15]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The Government, relying solely on certain obscure passages in some early law review
            articles by Fox, contends that while the common-law courts may not have traditionally
            possessed power to punish all criminal contempts without a regular trial they had always
            exercised such authority with respect to disobedience of their decrees. I do not believe
            that the studies of Fox or of other students of the history of contempt support any such
            claim. As I understand him, Fox reaches precisely the opposite conclusion. In his
            authoritative treatise, expressly written to elaborate and further substantiate the
            opinions formed in his earlier law review comments, he states clearly at the outset:</p>
         "The first of [this series of earlier articles], entitled The King v. Almon, was written to
         show that in former times the offence of contempt committed out of court was tried by a
         jury in the ordinary course of law and not summarily by the Court as at present [1927]. The
         later articles also bear upon the history of the procedure in matters of contempt. Further
            <span class="star-pagination">*205</span> inquiry confirmed the opinion originally
         formed with regard to the trial of contempt and brought to light a considerable amount of
         additional evidence which, with the earlier matter, is embodied in the following chapters .
         . . ."<span class="sup">[16]</span>
         <p>Then in summarizing he asserts that strangers to court proceedings were never punished
            except by the ordinary processes of the criminal law for contempts committed out of the
            court's presence until some time after the dissolution of the Star Chamber; he
            immediately follows with the judgment that parties were governed by the same general
            rules that applied to strangers.<span class="sup">[17]</span> Of course he recognizes
            the antiquity of the jurisdiction of courts to enforce their orders by conditional
            confinement, but such coercion, as pointed out before, is obviously something quite
            different from the infliction of purely punitive penalties for criminal contempt when
            compliance is no longer possible.</p>
         <p>Professors Frankfurter and Landis in their fine article likewise unequivocally
            declare:</p> ". . . the Clayton Act [providing for jury trial of certain charges of
         criminal contempt] does nothing new. It is as old as the best traditions of the common law.
         . . . "Down to the early part of the eighteenth century cases of contempt even in and about
         the common-law courts when not committed by persons officially connected with the court
         were dealt with by the ordinary course of law, i. e., tried by jury, except when the
         offender confessed or when the offense was committed `in the actual view of the court.' . .
         . ..... <span class="star-pagination">*206</span> "[U]ntil 1720 there is no instance in the
         common-law precedents of punishment otherwise than after trial in the ordinary course and
         not by summary process."<span class="sup">[18]</span>
         <p>And Professor Beale in his discussion of the matter concludes:</p> "As early as the time
         of Richard III it was said that the chancellor of England compels a party against whom an
         order is issued by imprisonment; and a little later it was said in the chancery that `a
         decree does not bind the right, but only binds the person to obedience, so that if the
         party will not obey, then the chancellor may commit him to prison till he obey, and that is
         all the chancellor can do.' This imprisonment was by no means a punishment, but was merely
         to secure obedience to the writ of the king. Down to within a century [Beale was writing in
         1908] it was very doubtful if the chancellor could under any circumstances inflict
         punishment for disobedience of a decree. . . . In any case the contempt of a defendant who
         had violated a decree in chancery could be purged by doing the act commanded and paying
         costs; . . . . ..... "Where the court inflicts a definite term of imprisonment by way of
         punishment for the violation of its orders, the case does not differ, it would seem, from
         the case of criminal contempt out of court, and regular process and trial by jury should be
            required."<span class="sup">[19]</span>
         <p>In brief the available historical material as reported and analyzed by the recognized
            authorities in this field <span class="star-pagination">*207</span> squarely refutes the
            Government's insistence that disobedience of a court order has always been an exception
            punishable by summary process. Insofar as this particular case is concerned, the
            Government frankly concedes that it cannot point to a single instance in the entire
            course of Anglo-American legal history prior to this prosecution and two related
            contemporary cases where a defendant has been punished for criminal contempt by summary
            trial after fleeing from court-ordered imprisonment.<span class="sup">[20]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Those who claim that the delegates who ratified the Constitution and its contemporaneous
            Amendments intended to exempt the crime of contempt from the procedural safeguards
            expressly established by those great charters for the trial of "all crimes" carry a
            heavy burden indeed. There is nothing in the Constitution or any of its Amendments which
            even remotely suggests such an exception. And as the Government points out in its brief,
            it does not appear that there was a word of discussion in the Constitutional Convention
            or in any of the state ratifying conventions recognizing or affirming the jurisdiction
            of courts to punish this crime by summary process, a power which in all particulars is
            so inherently alien to the method of punishing other public offenses provided by the
            Constitution.</p>
         <p>In the beginning the contempt power with its essentially arbitrary procedures was a
            petty, insignificant part of our law involving the use of trivial penalties to preserve
            order in the courtroom and maintain the authority of the courts.<span class="sup"
               >[21]</span> But since the adoption of the Constitution <span class="star-pagination"
               >*208</span> it has undergone an incredible transformation and growth, slowly at
            first and then with increasing acceleration, until it has become a powerful and
            pervasive device for enforcement of the criminal law. It is no longer the same
            comparatively innocuous power that it was. Its summary procedures have been pressed into
            service for such far-flung purposes as to prevent "unlawful" labor practices, to enforce
            the prohibition laws, to secure civil liberties and now, for the first time in our
            history, to punish a convict for fleeing from imprisonment.<span class="sup">[22]</span>
            In brief it has become a common device for by-passing the constitutionally prescribed
            safeguards of the regular criminal law in punishing public wrongs. But still worse, its
            subversive potential to that end appears to be virtually unlimited. All the while the
            sentences imposed on those found guilty of contempt have steadily mounted, until now
            they are even imprisoned for years.</p>
         <p>I cannot help but believe that this arbitrary power to punish by summary process, as now
            used, is utterly irreconcilable with first principles underlying our Constitution and
            the system of government it created&#x97; principles which were uppermost in the minds
            of the generation <span class="star-pagination">*209</span> that adopted the
            Constitution. Above all that generation deeply feared and bitterly abhorred the
            existence of arbitrary, unchecked power in the hands of any government official,
            particularly when it came to punishing alleged offenses against the state. A great
            concern for protecting individual liberty from even the possibility of irresponsible
            official action was one of the momentous forces which led to the Bill of Rights. And the
            Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Amendments were directly and purposefully designed to
            confine the power of courts and judges, especially with regard to the procedures used
            for the trial of crimes.</p>
         <p>As manifested by the Declaration of Independence, the denial of trial by jury and its
            subversion by various contrivances was one of the principal complaints against the
            English Crown. Trial by a jury of laymen and no less was regarded as the birthright of
            free men.<span class="sup">[23]</span> Witness the fierce opposition of the colonials to
            the courts of admiralty in which judges instead of citizen juries were authorized to try
            those charged with violating certain laws.<span class="sup">[24]</span> The same zealous
            determination to protect jury trial dominated the state conventions which ratified the
            Constitution and eventually led to the solemn reaffirmation of that mode of trial in the
            Bill of Rights&#x97;not only for all criminal prosecutions but for all civil causes
            involving $20 or more. See 2 Story, Commentaries on the Constitution (5th ed. 1891). §§
            1763-1768. I find it difficult <span class="star-pagination">*210</span> to understand
            how it can be maintained that the same people who manifested such great concern for
            trial by jury as to explicitly embed it in the Constitution for every $20 civil suit
            could have intended that this cherished method of trial should not be available to those
            threatened with long imprisonment for the crime of contempt. I am confident that if
            there had been any inkling that the federal courts established under the Constitution
            could impose heavy penalties, as they now do, for violation of their sweeping and
            far-ranging mandates without giving the accused a fair trial by his fellow citizens it
            would have provoked a storm of protest, to put it mildly. Would any friend of the
            Constitution have been foolhardy enough to take the floor of the ratifying convention in
            Virginia or any of a half dozen other States and even suggest such a possibility?<span
               class="sup">[25]</span>
         </p>
         <p>As this Court has often observed, "The Constitution was written to be understood by the
            voters; its words and phrases were used in their normal and ordinary as distinguished
            from technical meaning," United States v. Sprague, 282 U. S. 716, 731; ". . .
            constitutions, although framed by conventions, are yet created by the votes of the
            entire body of electors in a State, the most of whom are little disposed, even if they
            were able, to engage in such refinements. The simplest and most obvious interpretation
            of a constitution, if in itself sensible, is the <span class="star-pagination"
               >*211</span> most likely to be that meant by the people in its adoption," Lake County
            v. Rollins, 130 U. S. 662, 671. Cf. Mr. Justice Holmes in Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S.
            189, 219-220 (dissenting opinion). It is wholly beyond my comprehension how the
            generality of laymen, or for that matter even thoughtful lawyers, either at the end of
            the Eighteenth Century or today, could possibly see an appreciable difference between
            the crime of contempt, at least as it has now evolved, and other major crimes, or why
            they would wish to draw any distinction between the two so far as basic constitutional
            rights were concerned.</p>
         <p>It is true that Blackstone in his Commentaries incorporated Wilmot's erroneous fancy
            that at common law the courts had immemorially punished all criminal contempts without
            regular trial. Much ado is made over this by the proponents of summary proceedings. Yet
            at the very same time Blackstone openly classified and uniformly referred to contempt as
            a "crime" throughout his treatise, as in fact it had traditionally been regarded and
            punished at common law.<span class="sup">[26]</span> Similarly, other legal treatise,
            available in this country during the period when the Constitution was established
            plainly treated contempt as a "crime."<span class="sup">[27]</span> It seems to me that
            if any guide to the meaning of the Constitution can be fashioned from the circulation of
            the Commentaries and these other legal authorities through the former colonies
            (primarily among lawyers and judges) it is at least as compatible with the <span
               class="star-pagination">*212</span> view that the Constitution requires a jury trial
            for criminal contempts as with the contrary notion.</p>
         <p>But far more significant, our Constitution and Bill of Rights were manifestly not
            designed to perpetuate, to preserve inviolate, every arbitrary and oppressive
            governmental practice then tolerated, or thought to be, in England. Cf. Bridges v.
            California, 314 U. S. 252, 263-268. Those who formed the Constitution struck out a new
            free of previous shackles in an effort to obtain a better order of government more
            congenial to human liberty and welfare. It cannot be seriously claimed that they
            intended to adopt the common law wholesale. They accepted those portions of it which
            were adapted to this country and conformed to the ideals of its citizens and rejected
            the remainder. In truth there was widespread hostility to the common law in general and
            profound opposition to its adoption into our jurisprudence from the commencement of the
            Revolutionary War until long after the Constitution was ratified. As summarized by one
            historian:</p> "The Revolutionary War made everything connected with the law of England
         distasteful to the people at large. The lawyers knew its value: the community did not.
         Public sentiment favored an American law for America. It was quickened by the unfriendly
         feeling toward the mother country which became pronounced toward the close of the
         eighteenth century and culminated in the War of 1812."<span class="sup">[28]</span>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*213</span> Although the bench and bar, particularly those
            who were adherents to the principles of the <ref type="" num="">Federalist</ref> Party, often favored carrying
            forward the common law to the fullest possible extent popular sentiment was
            overwhelmingly against them.<span class="sup">[29]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Apologists for summary trial of the crime of contempt also endeavor to justify it as a
            "necessity" if judicial orders are to be observed and the needful authority of the
            courts maintained. "Necessity" is often used in this context as convenient or desirable.
            But since we are dealing with an asserted power which derogates from and is
            fundamentally inconsistent with our ordinary, constitutionally prescribed methods of
            proceeding in criminal cases, "necessity," if it can justify at all, must at least refer
            to a situation where the extraordinary power to punish by summary process is clearly
            indispensable to the enforcement of court decrees and the orderly administration of
            justice. Or as this Court has repeatedly phrased it, the courts in punishing contempts
            should be rigorously restricted to the "least possible power adequate to the end
            proposed." See, e. g., In re Michael, 326 U. S. 224, 227.</p>
         <p>Stark necessity is an impressive and often compelling thing, but unfortunately it has
            all too often been claimed loosely and without warrant in the law, as elsewhere, to
            justify that which in truth is unjustifiable. As one of <span class="star-pagination"
               >*214</span> our great lawyers, Edward Livingston, observed in proposing the complete
            abolition of summary trial of criminal contempts:</p> "Not one of the oppressive
         prerogatives of which the crown has been successively stripped, in England, but was in its
         day, defended on the plea of necessity. Not one of the attempts to destroy them, but was
         deemed a hazardous innovation."<span class="sup">[30]</span>
         <p>When examined in closer detail the argument from "necessity" appears to rest on the
            assumption that the regular criminal processes, including trial by petit jury and
            indictment by grand jury, will not result in conviction and punishment of a fair share
            of those guilty of violating court orders, are unduly slow and cumbersome, and by
            intervening between the court and punishment for those who disobey its mandate somehow
            detract from its dignity and prestige. Obviously this argument reflects substantial
            disrespect for the institution of trial by jury, although this method of trial
            is&#x97;and has been for centuries&#x97;an integral and highly esteemed part of our
            system of criminal justice enshrined in the Constitution itself. Nothing concrete is
            ever offered to support the innuendo that juries will not convict the same proportion of
            those guilty of contempt as would judges. Such evidence as is available plus my own
            experience convinces me that by and large juries are fully as responsible in meeting out
            justice in criminal cases as are the judiciary.<span class="sup">[31]</span> At the same
            time, and immeasurably more important, trial before a jury and in full compliance with
            all of the other protections of the Bill of Rights is much <span class="star-pagination"
               >*215</span> less likely to result in a miscarriage of justice than summary trial by
            the same judge who issued the order allegedly violated.</p>
         <p>Although some are prone to overlook it, an accused's right to trial by a jury of his
            fellow citizens when charged with a serious criminal offense is unquestionably one of
            his most valuable and well-established safeguards in this country.<span class="sup"
               >[32]</span> In the words of Chief Justice Cooley: "The law has established this
            tribunal because it is believed that, from its numbers, the mode of their selection, and
            the fact that jurors come from all classes of society, they are better calculated to
            judge of motives, weigh probabilities, and take what may be called a common sense view
            of a set of circumstances, involving both act and intent, than any single man, however
            pure, wise and eminent he may be. This is the theory of the law; and as applied to
            criminal accusations, it is eminently wise, and favorable alike to liberty and to
            justice." People v. Garbutt, <span class="citation no-link">

            barrier to oppression by government officers. As one of the more perceptive students of
            our experiment in freedom keenly observed, "The institution of the jury . . . places the
            real direction of society in the hands of the governed, or of a portion of the governed,
            and not in that of the government." 1 De Tocqueville, Democracy in America (Reeve
            trans., 1948 ed.), 282. The jury injects a democratic element into the law. This element
            is vital to the effective administration of criminal justice, <span
               class="star-pagination">*216</span> not only in safeguarding the rights of the
            accused, but in encouraging popular acceptance of the laws and the necessary general
            acquiescence in their application. It can hardly be denied that trial by jury removes a
            great burden from the shoulders of the judiciary. Martyrdom does not come easily to a
            man who has been found guilty as charged by twelve of his neighbors and fellow
            citizens.</p>
         <p>It is undoubtedly true that a judge can dispose of charges of criminal contempt faster
            and cheaper than a jury. But such trifling economies as may result have not generally
            been thought sufficient reason for abandoning our great constitutional safeguards aimed
            at protecting freedom and other basic human rights of incalculable value. Cheap, easy
            convictions were not the primary concern of those who adopted the Constitution and the
            Bill of Rights. Every procedural safeguard they established purposely made it more
            difficult for the Government to convict those it accused of crimes. On their scale of
            values justice occupied at least as high a position as economy. But even setting this
            dominant consideration to one side, what compelling necessity is there for special
            dispatch in punishing criminal contempts, especially those occurring beyond the
            courtroom? When the desired action or inaction can no longer be compelled by coercive
            measures and all that remains is the punishment of past sins there is adequate time to
            give defendants the full benefit of the ordinary criminal procedures. As a matter of
            fact any slight delay involved might well discourage a court from resorting to hasty,
            unnecessary measures to chastise suspected disobedience. I believe that Mr. Justice
            Holmes, speaking for himself and Mr. Justice Brandeis, took his stand on invulnerable
            ground when he declared that where "there is no need for immediate action contempts are
            like any other breach of law and should be dealt with as the law deals with other <span
               class="star-pagination">*217</span> illegal acts." Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United
            States, 247 U. S. 402, 425-426 (dissenting opinion).<span class="sup">[33]</span>
         </p>
         <p>For almost a half century the Clayton Act has provided for trial by jury in all cases of
            criminal contempt where the alleged contempt is also a violation of a federal criminal
               statute.<span class="sup">[34]</span> And since 1931 the Norris-LaGuardia Act has
            granted the same right where a charge of criminal contempt is based on the alleged
            violation of an injunction issued in a labor dispute.<span class="sup">[35]</span>
            Notwithstanding the forebodings of calamity and destruction of the judicial system which
            preceded, accompanied and briefly followed these reforms, there is no indication
            whatever that trial by jury has impaired the effectiveness or authority of the courts in
            these important areas of the law. Furthermore it appears that in at least five States
            one accused of the crime of contempt is entitled, at least to some degree, to demand
            jury trial where the alleged contempt occurred <span class="star-pagination">*218</span>
            beyond the courtroom.<span class="sup">[36]</span> Again, I am unable to find any
            evidence, or even an assertion, that judicial orders have been stripped of their
            efficacy or courts deprived of their requisite dignity by the intervention of the jury
            in those States. So far as can be discerned the wheels of justice have not ground to a
            halt or even noticeably slowed. After all the English courts apparently got on with
            their business for six or seven centuries without any general power to try charges of
            criminal contempt summarily.</p>
         <p>I am confident that in the long run due respect for the courts and their mandates would
            be much more likely if they faithfully observed the procedures laid down by our
            nationally acclaimed charter of liberty, the Bill of Rights.<span class="sup"
               >[37]</span> Respect and obedience in this country are not engendered&#x97;and
            rightly not&#x97;by arbitrary and autocratic procedures. In the end such methods only
            yield real contempt for the courts and the law. The classic example of this is the use
            and abuse of the injunction and summary contempt power in the labor field. The federal
            courts have still not recovered from the scars inflicted by their intervention in that
            area where Congress finally stepped in and preserved the right of jury trial to all
            those charged with the crime of contempt.</p>
         <p>In the last analysis there is no justification in history, in necessity, or most
            important in the Constitution for trying those charged with violating a court's decree
            in a manner wholly different from those accused of disobeying any other mandate of the
            state. It is significant that neither the Court nor the Government makes any serious
            effort to justify such differentiation except that it has been sanctioned by prior
            decisions. Under the <span class="star-pagination">*219</span> Constitution courts are
            merely one of the coordinate agencies which hold and exercise governmental power. Their
            decrees are simply another form of sovereign directive aimed at guiding the citizen's
            activity. I can perceive nothing which places these decrees on any higher or different
            plane than the laws of Congress or the regulations of the Executive insofar as
            punishment for their violation is concerned. There is no valid reason why they should be
            singled out for an extraordinary and essentially arbitrary mode of enforcement.
            Unfortunately judges and lawyers have told each other the contrary so often that they
            have come to accept it as the gospel truth. In my judgment trial by the same procedures,
            constitutional and otherwise, which are extended to criminal defendants in all other
            instances is also wholly sufficient for the crime of contempt.</p></div>

         <p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join,
            dissenting.</p>
         <p>I dissent because I do not believe that the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond
            a reasonable doubt the petitioners' guilt of the criminal contempt charged.</p>
         <p>Petitioners were among 11 leaders of the Communist Party who were convicted of violation
            of the Smith Act, now 18 U. S. C. § 2385, on October 14, 1949. Both were sentenced to a
            fine of $10,000 and to five years' imprisonment, and were enlarged on bail pending
            appeal. The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions on August 1, 1950, and this Court
            in turn affirmed on June 4, 1951. Dennis v. United States, 341 U. S. 494. On June 28,
            1951, prior to formal receipt of the Supreme Court judgment, the District Court drew up
            a proposed Order on Mandate making the judgment of this Court that of the District
            Court. The last paragraph "FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED and decreed that the defendants
            personally surrender to the United States Marshal . . . on the 2nd day of July, <span
               class="star-pagination">*220</span> 1951 . . . ." This proposed order was served on
            the attorneys for the 11 and they promised to bring their clients into court the
            following Monday, July 2, to begin serving their sentences. On Friday, June 29, the
            attorneys met with all the defendants and "advised that they all should be present [in
            court on Monday] and . . . [were] assured they would be." But by Monday four had
            absconded. Since seven were present, however, the Order on Mandate was signed, and the
            seven were taken off to serve their prison terms. The court canceled the bail of the
            missing four on July 3 and issued a bench warrant for their arrest. Two of the four,
            Hall and Thompson, were apprehended in 1951 and 1953 respectively and were convicted of
            criminal contempt. United States v. Hall, 198 F. 2d 726; United States v. Thompson, 214
            F. 2d 545. The petitioners surrendered voluntarily in 1956 and were likewise convicted
            of criminal contempt. The contempt charged in each instance was a violation of 18 U. S.
            C. § 401 (3) by disobedience of the provision of the Order on Mandate, issued on the
            morning of July 2, 1951, requiring the surrender of all the Dennis defendants to the
            United States Marshal at 11:05 a. m. on that day. Significantly, at the time the judge
            signed the order he lined out the hour of surrender, appearing as 10:30 in the proposed
            order, and substituted 11:05, the time at which the order was actually signed. See the
            opinion of Judge Biggs in United States v. Hall, supra, at 732.</p>
         <p>The most that can be said is that the evidence might have been sufficient to support
            conviction of the petitioners for bail jumping if that had been an offense at the time
            they fled. But bail jumping did not become a separate crime until three years after the
            petitioners' flight, when this void in the law&#x97;highlighted by the petitioners'
            conduct&#x97;led the Department of Justice to secure the enactment of 18 U. S. C. §
            3146. See H. R. Rep. No. 2104, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. But, in any event, bail jumping is
               <span class="star-pagination">*221</span> not the offense charged, and, although it
            is certainly a most serious obstruction of the administration of justice, it is not in
            itself a criminal contempt.</p>
         <p>The Court relates the criminal contempt charged to bail jumping by its use of § 3146 as
            support for the sentences imposed upon the petitioners. But bail jumping under § 3146 is
            proved merely by evidence that the accused willfully failed to surrender within 30 days
            after incurring a forfeiture of his bail. Much more, however, than evidence sustaining a
            conviction for bail jumping is necessary to sustain convictions for the contempts here
            charged of violating 18 U. S. C. § 401 (3) by willful and knowing disobedience of a
            single provision of the Order on Mandate of July 2, 1951. The indispensable element of
            that offense, to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, Gompers v. Bucks Stove &amp;amp;
            Range Co., 221 U. S. 418, 444, is that the petitioners, who were not served with the
            order, in some other way obtained actual knowledge of its existence and command. Kelton
            v. United States, 294 F. 491; In re Kwelman, 31 F. Supp. 23; see Wilson v. North
            Carolina, 169 U. S. 586.</p>
         <p>Assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence bearing on the petitioners' knowledge
            requires that the precise time at which the order came into existence be kept clearly in
            mind. The Court of Appeals below fell into palpable error in reading the specifications
            to charge "disobedience of the order of June 28." 241 F. 2d 631, 632. The order was not
            signed or entered until court convened after 10 o'clock on the morning of July 2. What
            happened on June 28 was that the attorneys of the Dennis defendants were served with
            copies of a proposed order to be entered on July 2. But the attorneys' knowledge cannot
            be imputed to their clients. In re Kwelman, supra. The petitioners had absconded by July
            2, and the record is completely silent as to their whereabouts from June 29 until they
            surrendered almost five years later. Concededly, <span class="star-pagination"
               >*222</span> direct evidence of knowledge by the petitioners of the order of July 2
            is wholly lacking and the case for conviction rests entirely upon circumstantial
            evidence.</p>
         <p>The proof upon which reliance is placed consists of evidence (1) that the petitioners
            knew on June 29, 1951, that the order was to be entered on July 2, and (2) that the
            petitioners made certain statements to the press at the time of their surrender almost
            five years later.</p>
         <p>First. Manifestly, foreknowledge that an order might come into existence does not prove
            knowledge that it did come into existence. Even if the petitioners knew on June 29 that
            the order was likely to be signed on July 2, the most that can be said is that after
            July 2 the petitioners knew that the order was to have been entered. This, of course, is
            not the same as knowledge that the order had been entered, and it is the latter
            knowledge which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Knowledge that the
            order had been entered, of course, could only be acquired by the petitioners after the
            order had come into existence on the morning of July 2; and that knowledge can hardly be
            inferred from the events which occurred prior to the moment the order was entered. See
            the opinion of Judge Biggs in United States v. Hall, 198 F. 2d 726, 733-735.</p>
         <p>The Government's lack of confidence in the proofs to show actual knowledge is implicit
            in its effort to sustain the convictions on a theory of constructive knowledge derived
            from the events of June 28 and from the evidence that on June 29 the petitioners and the
            other Dennis defendants were told by the attorneys that they must be in court on July 2.
            The short answer to this contention is that the petitioners are not charged with
            disobedience of an order of which they had constructive knowledge but with disobedience
            of an order of which they had actual knowledge, and conviction can be had on the precise
            charge, or not at all. In any event, the sole authority <span class="star-pagination"
               >*223</span> relied upon by the Government is a dictum in Pettibone v. United States,
            148 U. S. 197, 206-207, to the effect that persons may be chargeable with knowledge of
            an order from notice that an application will be made for the order. But whatever its
            utility in civil cases, theories of constructive knowledge have no place in the criminal
            law. Not only is this forcefully demonstrated in Judge Biggs' opinion in United States
            v. Hall, supra, but the Pettibone dictum has not been followed in criminal contempt
            cases. Kelton v. United States, supra; In re Kwelman, supra.</p>
         <p>Second. Since the evidence of knowledge that an order was to be entered is not
            sufficient to prove knowledge that the order was entered, what of the evidence of what
            was said by the petitioners at the time of their surrender? The Court refers to the
            petitioners' press releases in which they stated they would surrender to "enter prison,"
            and to Green's further reference that he intended to "go to the United States Marshal's
            Office." But, of course, surrender could only have been to enter prison. Their
            statements prove no more than what the petitioners and everyone else knew had to happen
            when this Court affirmed their Smith Act convictions in 1951. And it can hardly be
            doubted that, after the many months these petitioners spent at their trial in the Foley
            Square Courthouse, both the location and function of the Marshal's Office was well known
            to them. That the Court must resort to these statements to find probative weight in the
            evidence demonstrates the inherent insufficiency of the proofs to show actual
            knowledge.</p>
         <p>Nor do there appear other circumstances from which knowledge may be inferred. The
            Court's opinion gives the impression that the surrender order was an order in familiar
            and customary use, well known to the sophisticated in the criminal law. I doubt that
            even widely experienced criminal lawyers encounter this provision very often. The
            provision was not the occasion for the <span class="star-pagination">*224</span> entry
            of the order of July 2. The purpose of that order, as its caption "Order on Mandate"
            shows, was to enter an order in the District Court to give effect to the Mandate of this
            Court affirming the convictions of the Dennis defendants. But for the necessity of
            entering an order for that purpose there may well have been no surrender order. No
            statute or rule of court, even a local rule of the District Court, can be pointed to as
            requiring inclusion of the surrender provision. The bondsman who stands to lose the
            posted bail, not a surrender order, is usually counted on to produce the defendant.
            Hearings before Subcommittee No. 4 of the House Committee on the Judiciary on H. R.
            8658, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 14-19. This is not to say, of course, that the provision was
            in any way improper or illegal or served no useful purpose. Nevertheless its novelty is
            indicated when the Court must look to a provision of the bail bond as the only
            discoverable source of authority for the provision.</p>
         <p>I can well understand why the Government should have desired to proceed against these
            petitioners for their serious obstruction of the administration of justice. In the
            absence of a statutory provision aimed directly at this conduct, the Government resorted
            to this attempt to punish that obstruction as a criminal contempt. However, regardless
            of the view taken on the underlying constitutional issue involved, the odiousness of the
            offense cannot be a reason for relaxing the normal standards of proof required to
            sustain a conviction under § 401 (3). Believing that the proofs in this case fall short
            of that standard, I must dissent.</p>

         <p>[1] This Rule provides that criminal contempts other than those committed in the actual
            presence of the court and seen or heard by the court shall be prosecuted on notice.
            Notice may be given, as in the present case, by an order to show cause. The Rule states
            that a defendant is entitled to trial by jury if an Act of Congress so provides. See

         <p>[2] The debates conducted in 1830-1831 by leading counsel of that period during the
            impeachment proceedings against Judge James H. Peck, see p. 171, infra, contained
            discussions of the Act of 1789, and the limitations to be imposed upon it, which were
            cast largely in terms of the English common law preceding its enactment. See Stansbury,
            Report of the Trial of James H. Peck (1833).</p>
         <p>[3] During the debates in 1830-1831 referred to in note 2, supra, several of the
            managers who argued that Judge Peck had exceeded the historical boundaries of the
            contempt power by the conduct which had provoked the impeachment proceedings (see p.
            171, infra) appear to have assumed that courts were historically justified in employing
            the contempt power to deal with disobedience to court process. See Stansbury, supra,
            note 2, at 313, 395-396, 436, 444.</p>

            administration of justice, and Cammer v. United States, 350 U. S. 399, arising under §
            401 (2), which deals with misbehavior of court officers in their official
            transactions.</p>
         <p>[5] This order can hardly be interpreted otherwise than as imposing on the Dennis
            defendants from the time that the order became effective on July 2 a continuing
            obligation to surrender promptly upon becoming aware of its effectiveness. The printed
            record before us indicates that the proposed order given counsel on June 28 read
            precisely in the form quoted in the text above, but the original copy of the other
            reveals that the time for surrender was first written as "10:30" a. m., and at some
            later time prior to the time the order was signed was changed to read "11:05."
            Petitioners make no issue of this discrepancy, and we attach no significance to it.</p>
         <p>[6] The events of June 29, 1951, were testified to in court on July 3, 1951, by
            petitioners' counsel, Messrs. Sacher and Isserman. By stipulation, a transcript of this
            testimony was introduced into evidence during the contempt proceedings in the District
            Court, and excerpts from the testimony follow: </p>
         <p>The Court: "Now, you did make a statement last week that you will have the four
            defendants [Green, Winston, Hall and Thompson] in court, as I recall, on Monday [July
            2].</p>
         <p>"Mr. Sacher: I said that all of them would be here.</p>
         <p>.....</p>
         <p>"The Court: And as you know, four of them were not here on Monday. Of course, you may be
            bound by some obligation of attorney and client, but are you able to give the Court any
            information as to their present whereabouts?</p>
         <p>"Mr. Sacher: Your Honor, I should consider myself not bound by any obligation to
            withhold any information that I might have, and I give your Honor my assurance that I
            have no knowledge, I have no basis of knowledge as to their present whereabouts or where
            they might have gone.</p>
         <p>"The Court: Where did you last see these four defendants?</p>
         <p>.....</p>
         <p>"Mr. Sacher: . . . I am not certain about Thompson, but I am fairly certain that I saw
            the three I mentioned sometime on Friday [June 29] at 35 East Twelfth Street.</p>
         <p>"The Court: Did you tell them at that time that their presence was required in court
            yesterday morning?</p>
         <p>"Mr. Sacher: Definitely. As a matter of fact I advised that because I think I saw them
            among other defendants after I had been here on Friday, your Honor, and had made these
            motions [apparently referring to counsel's efforts to postpone the surrender date until
            after July 4], and therefore I advised that they all should be present and I was assured
            they would be.</p>
         <p>.....</p>
         <p>"The Court: Mr. Isserman, do you know where any of these defendants are?</p>
         <p>"Mr. Isserman: I might say to the Court that I would not rest on privilege in this
            situation at all. I have no knowledge of the present whereabouts of any of these
            defendants. . . . I remember, Green being my client, I remember distinctly that I saw
            him on that day [June 29] and received from him the assurance that he would be here
            Monday morning [July 2]."</p>
         <p>[7] Excerpts from Green's press release: </p>
         <p>"On Monday, February 27th at 12 noon I shall cease being a fugitive from injustice and
            instead become its prisoner. At that time, I shall appear at Foley Square. . . . The
            course I chose five years ago was not dictated by personal considerations. In many ways
            it was harsher than that of imprisonment. . . . [I]t seemed incumbent upon me to resist
            that trend [i.e. to `an American brand of fascism'] with every ounce of strength I
            possessed. Some could do so by going to jail; others by not. . . . I enter prison with
            head high and conscience clear." (Italics added.)</p>
         <p>Excerpts from Winston's press release:</p>
         <p>"Reiterating my innocence, and protesting the flagrant miscarriage of justice in my
            case, I now enter prison . . . . I shall appear this coming Monday, March 5th, 12:30 p.
            m., at the U. S. Marshal's Office in Foley Square." (Italics added.)</p>
         <p>[8] The substance of §§ 21 and 22 was that one charged with the commission of acts
            constituting willful disobedience to a lawful court order could demand a trial by jury
            if (§ 21) ". . . the act or thing so done by him be of such character as to constitute
            also a criminal offense under any statute of the United States, or under the laws of any
            State in which the act was committed . . . ." Section 22 provided that the jury trial ".
            . . shall conform, as near as may be, to the practice in criminal cases prosecuted by
            indictment or upon information."</p>
         <p>[9] This section excluded from the Act, inter alia, contempts committed by disobedience
            to any court order entered in any suit or action ". . . brought or prosecuted in the
            name of, or on behalf of, the United States . . . ."</p>
         <p>[10] At the present time, 18 U. S. C. § 402 contains the definitional provision formerly
            in § 21 of the Clayton Act and expressly refers to 18 U. S. C. § 3691, which provides
            that contempts falling within this definition are subject to trial by jury.</p>
         <p>[11] Petitioners have shown us no federal decision which intimates any constitutional or
            common-law restriction on the power of federal courts to sentence for over one year. As
            stated by the Court of Appeals in the present case, 241 F. 2d, at 634, ". . . there is
            not in the books a syllable of recognition of any such supposed limitation." Under

         <p>[14] The following are the major opinions of this Court which have discussed the
            relationship between criminal contempts and jury trial and have concluded or assumed
            that criminal contempts are not subject to jury trial under Art. III, § 2, or the Sixth
            Amendment: Savin, Petitioner, 131 U. S. 267, 278; Eilenbecker v. District Court of
            Plymouth County, 134 U. S. 31, 36-39; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, 154 U.

            few exceptions, are broadly phrased and do not refer to particular categories of
            criminal contempts, several of the cases involved review of contempt convictions arising
            out of disobedience to court orders. See in particular In re Debs, Gompers v. United
            States, and United States v. United Mine Workers. </p>

         <p>[18] Petitioners derive their argument as to historical error from the writings of Sir
            John Charles Fox. However, Fox's major effort was to show that a statement in an
            unpublished opinion by Wilmot, J., in The King v. Almon (1765), to the effect that
            summary punishment for contempts committed out of court stood upon "immemorial usage,"
            was based on an erroneous interpretation of earlier law as applied to the case before
            him, namely, contempt by libel on the court by a stranger to court proceedings. See Fox,
            The King v. Almon (Parts I and II), 24 L. Q. Rev. 184, 266; Fox, The History of Contempt
            of Court (1927), 5-43. That contempts committed in the view of the court were at an
            early date dealt with summarily is not disputed by Fox. The History of Contempt of
            Court, supra, at 50. Insofar as Fox discusses contempts out of court by disobedience to
            court orders, it is not clear whether the author contends that such contempts were tried
            at early English law under summary procedures only for civil coercive purposes, or for
            criminal, punitive purposes as well. Cf. The King v. Almon, supra, at 188, 277-278; and
            Fox, The Summary Process to Punish Contempt (Parts I and II), 25 L. Q. Rev. 238, 354,
            with The King v. Almon, at 195, 276; The Summary Process to Punish Contempt, at 249; and
            The History of Contempt of Court, supra, at 108-110. See also Beale, Contempt of Court,
            21 Harv. L. Rev. 161, 164, 169-171. Fox concludes that by the mid-Seventeenth or early
            Eighteenth Century, a variety of contempts committed outside of court were subject to
            punishment by the exercise of a court's summary jurisdiction. The Summary Process to
            Punish Contempts, supra, at 252, 366, 370-371. It appears that under present English law
            disobedience to court process is but one of the many categories of contempts of court
            which are dealt with summarily. 8 Halsbury, Laws of England (3d ed. 1954), 3-4, 25-26; 1
            Russell, Crime (10th ed. 1950), 329-330.</p>
         <p>[19] See 18 U. S. C. § 402, supra, note 10; 18 U. S. C. § 3692 (jury trial for contempts
            based on violation of injunctions in cases involving labor disputes); § 151, 71 Stat.
            638, 42 U. S. C. A. § 1995 (right to jury trial under provisions of the Civil Rights Act
            of 1957 in limited circumstances in cases of criminal contempts).</p>
         <p>[20] This holding makes unnecessary consideration of petitioners' argument based on Rule
            7 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which falls with their constitutional
            argument. Rule 7 refers to criminal offenses, that is "crimes" in the constitutional
            sense. Criminal contempts are governed by Rule 42.</p>

         <p>The materials on the basis of which this unbroken course of adjudication is proposed to
            be reversed have in fact been known in this country for almost half a century and were
            available to the Justices who participated in many of these decisions. The first of the
            studies of criminal contempt by Sir John Charles Fox, The King v. Almon, 24 Law Q. Rev.
            184, appeared in 1908, and the results of the research of Solly-Flood were published as
            early as 1886. The Story of Prince Henry of Monmouth and Chief-Justice Gascoign, 3
            Transactions of the Royal Historical Society (N. S.) 47. Mr. Justice Holmes, writing for
            the Court in Gompers v. United States, 233 U. S. 604 (1914), noted the work of
            Solly-Flood. He observed that: "It does not follow that contempts of the class under
            consideration are not crimes, or rather, in the language of the statute, offenses,
            because trial by jury as it has been gradually worked out and fought out has been
            thought not to extend to them as a matter of constitutional right. These contempts are
            infractions of the law, visited with punishment as such. If such acts are not criminal,
            we are in error as to the most fundamental characteristic of crimes as that word has
            been understood in English speech. So truly are they crimes that it seems to be proved
            that in the early law they were punished only by the usual criminal procedure, 3
            Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, N. S. p. 147 (1885), and that at least in
            England it seems that they still may be and preferably are tried in that way." 233 U.

         <p>[4] "We do not write on a blank sheet. The Court has its jurisprudence, the helpful
            repository of the deliberate and expressed convictions of generations of sincere minds
            addressing themselves to exposition and decision, not with the freedom of casual critics
            or even of studious commentators, but under the pressure and within the limits of a
            definite official responsibility." Chief Justice Hughes speaking on the occasion of the
            150th anniversary of the Court. 309 U. S. XIV.</p>
         <p>[1] The term "summary proceeding" (or "summary trial") is used in its ordinary sense to
            refer to a "form of trial in which the ancient established course of legal proceedings
            is disregarded, especially in the matter of trial by jury, and, in the case of the
            heavier crimes, presentment by a grand jury." 3 Bouvier's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 1914)
            3182. Of course as the law now stands contempts committed in the presence of the judge
            may be punished without any hearing or trial at all, summary or otherwise. For a
            flagrant example see Sacher v. United States, 343 U. S. 1.</p>

         <p>Much of what is said in this opinion is equally applicable to contempts committed in the

            that its opinion upon the construction of the Constitution is always open to discussion
            when it is supposed to have been founded in error, and that its judicial authority
            should hereafter depend altogether on the force of the reasoning by which it is

         <p>It also seems significant that the initial decisions by this Court actually upholding
            the power of the federal courts to punish contempts by summary process were not made
            until as late as the final decades of the last century, almost a full century after the
            adoption of the Constitution. Since that time the power has been vigorously challenged
            on a number of occasions. See, e. g., Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, 247 U. S.
            402, 425 (dissenting opinion); Sacher v. United States, 343 U. S. 1, 14 (dissenting
            opinion). Within the past few years there has been a tendency on the part of this Court
            to restrict the substantive scope of the contempt power to narrower bounds than had been
            formerly thought to exist. See, e. g., Nye v. United States, 313 U. S. 33; Bridges v.
            California, 314 U. S. 252; In re Michael, 326 U. S. 224; Cammer v. United States, 350 U.
            S. 399. Cf. In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257. In substantial part this is attributable to a
            deeply felt antipathy toward the arbitrary procedures now used to punish contempts.</p>

         <p>[8] A series of recent cases in this Court alone indicates that the personal emotions or
            opinions of judges often become deeply involved in the punishment of an alleged
            contempt. See, e. g., Fisher v. Pace, 336 U. S. 155; Sacher v. United States 343 U. S.
            1; Offutt v. United States, 348 U. S. 11; Nilva v. United States, 352 U. S. 385; Yates
            v. United States, 355 U. S. 66.</p>

         <p>[11] In accordance with established usage 18 U. S. C. § 1 defines a felony as any
            "offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year." By this
            standard the offense of contempt is not only a crime, but a felony&#x97;a crime of the
            gravest and most serious kind. </p>
         <p>Of course if the maximum punishment for criminal contempt were sufficiently limited that
            offense might no longer fall within the category of "crimes"; instead it might then be
            regarded, in the light of our previous decisions, as a "petty" or "minor" offense for
            which the defendant would not necessarily be entitled to trial by jury. See District of
            Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U. S. 617; Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540.</p>

         <p>"Since a charge of criminal contempt is essentially an accusation of crime, all the
            constitutional safeguards available to an accused in a criminal trial should be extended
            to prosecutions for such contempt." Frankfurter and Greene, The Labor Injunction,

         <p>[13] 18 U. S. C. § 3146.</p>
         <p>[14] One scholar has argued that even contempts in the face of the courts were tried by
            jury after indictment by grand jury until the reign of Elizabeth I. Solly-Flood, Prince
            Henry of Monmouth and Chief Justice Gascoign, 3 Transactions of the Royal Historical
            Society (N. S.) 47. Although agreeing that contempts in facie were often tried by a jury
            up to and beyond this period, Fox takes the view that such contempts were also
            punishable by summary procedures from the early common law.</p>
         <p>[15] In passing it is interesting to note that even Wilmot felt obliged to bolster his
            position by pointing to the fact that a defendant, under a notion then prevalent, could
            exonerate himself from a charge of contempt by fully denying the charges under oath. In
            this event he could only be prosecuted for false swearing in which case he was entitled,
            as Wilmot elaborately observes, to trial by jury. See Curtis and Curtis, The Story of a
            Notion in the Law of Criminal Contempt, 41 Harv. L. Rev. 51.</p>

         <p>[21] Although records of the colonial era are extremely fragmentary and inaccessible
            apparently such contempts as existed were not the subject of major punishment in that
            period. From the scattered reported cases it appears that alleged offenders were let off
            after an apology, a reprimand or a small fine or other relatively slight punishment. I
            have found no instance where anyone was unconditionally imprisoned for even a term of
            months, let alone years, during that era when extremely harsh penalties were otherwise
            commonplace.</p>
         <p>[22] The following are merely random samples of important and far-reaching federal
            regulatory Acts now in effect under which a violation of any provision of the Act is not
            only a statutory crime punishable as such but also may be enjoined at the Government's
            request and punished as a criminal contempt by summary process if the injunction is
            disobeyed. Securities Exchange Act, 48 Stat. 900, 15 U. S. C. § 78u; Natural Gas Act, 52
            Stat. 832, 15 U. S. C. § 717s; Fair Labor Standards Act, 52 Stat. 1069, 29 U. S. C. §
            217; Atomic Energy Act, 68 Stat. 959, 42 U. S. C. (Supp. IV) § 2280; Federal
            Communications Act, 48 Stat. 1092, 47 U. S. C. § 401; Defense Production Act of 1950, 64
            Stat. 817, 50 U. S. C. App. § 2156.</p>
         <p>[23] As early as 1765 delegates from nine colonies meeting in New York declared in a
            Declaration of Rights that trial by jury was the "inherent and invaluable right" of
            every colonial. 43 Harvard Classics 147, 148.</p>
         <p>[24] In 1775 Jefferson protested: "[Parliament has] extended the jurisdiction of the
            courts of admiralty beyond their antient limits thereby depriving us of the inestimable
            right of trial by jury in cases affecting both life and property and subjecting both to
            the decision arbitrary decision [sic] of a single and dependent judge." 2 Journals of
            the Continental Congress (Ford ed.) 132.</p>
         <p>[25] Although Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 83, authorized the
            federal courts to punish contempts "in any cause or hearing before the same," it did
            not, as this Court has pointed out, define what were contempts or prescribe the method
            of punishing them. Savin, Petitioner, 131 U. S. 267, 275. Section 17, which contains a
            number of other provisions, appears to have been a comparatively insignificant provision
            of the judicial code enacted by the Congress without material discussion in the midst of
            34 other sections, many of which were both extremely important and highly
            controversial.</p>
         <p>[26] See, e. g., 4 Blackstone's Commentaries 1-6, 119-126, 280-287. Also pertinent here
            is Blackstone's oft-quoted laudation of trial by jury "as the glory of the English law .
            . . . [I]t is the most transcendent privilege which any subject can enjoy, or wish for,
            that he cannot be affected either in his property, his liberty, or his person, but by
            the unanimous consent of twelve of his neighbours and equals." 3 id., at 379.</p>

         <p>"After the Revolution the public was extremely hostile to England and to all that was
            English and it was impossible for the common law to escape the odium of its English
            origin." Pound, The Spirit of the Common Law, 116. And see Warren, History of the
            American Bar, 224-228.</p>
         <p>[29] In 1804 the Chief Justice and two Associate Justices of the Pennsylvania Supreme
            Court were actually impeached for sentencing a person to jail for contempt. In part the
            impeachment rested on the feeling that punishment of contempt by summary process was an
            arbitrary practice of the common law unsuited to this country. While the Justices were
            narrowly acquitted this apparently only aggravated popular antagonism toward the
            contempt power. See 3 McMaster, History of the People of the United States (1938 ed.),

         <p>[33] Again this case aptly demonstrates the point. Here the defendants surrendered
            several years after they had been ordered to appear and serve their sentences. There was
            no reason for urgent action to punish them for their absence, there was ample time to
            impanel a jury and prosecute them in the regular manner. As a matter of fact almost a
            month and a half did elapse between their surrender and trial. </p>
         <p>Alleged contempts committed beyond the court's presence where the judge has no personal
            knowledge of the material facts are especially suited for trial by jury. A hearing must
            be held, witnesses must be called, and evidence taken in any event. Cf. Cooke v. United
            States, 267 U. S. 517. And often, as in this case, crucial facts are in close
            dispute.</p>
         <p>I might add, at this point, that MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN has forcefully demonstrated, in my
            judgment, that the evidence in this case was wholly insufficient to prove a crucial
            element of the offense charged&#x97;namely, notice of the surrender order.</p>
