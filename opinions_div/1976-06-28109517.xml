         <p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion in
            which MR. JUSTICE WHITE and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL joined.</p>
         <p>This case presents the question whether public employees who allege that they were
            discharged or threatened with discharge solely because of their partisan political
            affiliation or nonaffiliation state a claim for deprivation of constitutional rights
            secured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>Respondents brought this suit in the United States District Court for the Northern
            District of Illinois <span class="star-pagination">*350</span> against petitioners,
            Richard J. Elrod, Richard J. Daley, the Democratic Organization of Cook County, and the
            Democratic County Central Committee of Cook County. Their complaint alleged that they
            were discharged or threatened with discharge solely for the reason that they were not
            affiliated with or sponsored by the Democratic Party. They sought declaratory,
            injunctive, and other relief for violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and
            42 U. S. C. §§ 1983, 1985, 1986, 1988. Finding that the respondents failed to make an
            adequate showing of irreparable injury, the District Court denied their motion for a
            preliminary injunction and ultimately dismissed their complaint for failure to state a
            claim upon which relief could be granted. The United States Court of Appeals for the
            Seventh Circuit, relying on Illinois State Employees Union v. Lewis, 473 F. 2d 561 (CA7
            1972), reversed and remanded, holding that respondents' complaint stated a legally
            cognizable claim. The Court of Appeals instructed the District Court to enter
            appropriate preliminary injunctive relief. 509 F. 2d 1133 (1975). We granted certiorari.
            423 U. S. 821. We affirm.<span class="sup">[1]</span>
         </p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>In December 1970, the Sheriff of Cook County, a Republican, was replaced by Richard
            Elrod, a Democrat. At that time, respondents, all Republicans, were employees of the
            Cook County Sheriff's Office. They were non-civil-service employees and, therefore, not
            covered by any statute, ordinance, or regulation protecting them from arbitrary
            discharge. One respondent, John Burns, was Chief Deputy of the Process Division and
            supervised all departments of the Sheriff's Office working on the <span
               class="star-pagination">*351</span> seventh floor of the building housing that
            office. Frank Vargas was a bailiff and security guard at the Juvenile Court of Cook
            County. Fred L. Buckley was employed as a process server in the office. Joseph Dennard
            was an employee in the office.</p>
         <p>It has been the practice of the Sheriff of Cook County, when he assumes office from a
            Sheriff of a different political party, to replace non-civil-service employees of the
            Sheriff's Office with members of his own party when the existing employees lack or fail
            to obtain requisite support from, or fail to affiliate with, that party. Consequently,
            subsequent to Sheriff Elrod's assumption of office, respondents, with the exception of
            Buckley, were discharged from their employment solely because they did not support and
            were not members of the Democratic Party and had failed to obtain the sponsorship of one
            of its leaders. Buckley is in imminent danger of being discharged solely for the same
            reasons. Respondents allege that the discharges were ordered by Sheriff Elrod under the
            direction of the codefendants in this suit.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>At the outset, we are met with objections to our consideration of this case based on the
            political-question doctrine and the principle of separation of powers. These objections
            need not long detain us.</p>
         <p>A question presented to this Court for decision is properly deemed political when its
            resolution is committed by the Constitution to a branch of the Federal Government other
            than this Court. Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 217 (1962). Thus, "it is the relationship
            between the judiciary and the coordinate branches of the Federal Government, and not the
            federal judiciary's relationship to the States, which gives rise to the `political
            question.' " Id., at 210. That matters related to a State's, or even the Federal
            Government's, elective process are implicated by <span class="star-pagination"
               >*352</span> this Court's resolution of a question is not sufficient to justify our
            withholding decision of the question. In particular, in this case, we are asked only to
            determine whether the politically motivated discharge of employees of the Cook County
            Sheriff's Office comports with the limitations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
            This involves solely a question of constitutional interpretation, a function ultimately
            the responsibility of this Court. Id., at 211. See Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486,
            518-549 (1969). Petitioners do not, and could not, argue that a decision as to the
            constitutionality of the Sheriff's practices should be left to Congress or the
            President. The political-question doctrine, therefore, is no obstacle to judicial review
            in this case. See Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U. S. 23, 28 (1968).</p>
         <p>Petitioners also object that our review of this case will offend the principle of
            separation of powers, for the executive's responsibility to insure that the laws be
            faithfully executed requires the power of appointment or removal at will, unimpaired by
            any judicial oversight. They cite Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52 (1926), in
            support of their argument. The short answer to this argument is that the
            separation-of-powers principle, like the political-question doctrine, has no
            applicability to the federal judiciary's relationship to the States. The matter in Myers
            itself was limited to the permissibility of restraints imposed by Congress on the
            President concerning the removal of the executive officers. More fundamentally, however,
            the answer to petitioners' objection is that there can be no impairment of executive
            power, whether on the state or federal level, where actions pursuant to that power are
            impermissible under the Constitution. Where there is no power, there can be no
            impairment of power. And our determination of the limits on state executive power
            contained in the Constitution <span class="star-pagination">*353</span> is in proper
            keeping with our primary responsibility of interpreting that document. It is to such a
            determination that we now turn.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>IV</h2>
         <p>The Cook County Sheriff's practice of dismissing employees on a partisan basis is but
            one form of the general practice of political patronage.<span class="sup">[2]</span> The
            practice also includes placing loyal supporters in government jobs that may or may not
            have been made available by political discharges. Nonofficeholders may be the
            beneficiaries of lucrative government contracts for highway construction, buildings, and
            supplies. Favored wards may receive improved public services. Members of the judiciary
            may even engage in the practice through the appointment of receiverships, trusteeships,
            and refereeships. Although political patronage comprises a broad range of activities, we
            are here concerned only with the constitutionality of dismissing public employees for
            partisan reasons.</p>
         <p>Patronage practice is not new to American politics. It has existed at the federal level
            at least since the Presidency of Thomas Jefferson,<span class="sup">[3]</span> although
            its popularization and legitimation primarily occurred later, in the Presidency of
            Andrew Jackson.<span class="sup">[4]</span> The practice is not unique to American
            politics. It has been used in many European countries,<span class="sup">[5]</span> and
            in darker times, it played a significant role in the Nazi rise to power in Germany and
            other totalitarian states.<span class="sup">[6]</span> More recent times have witnessed
               <span class="star-pagination">*354</span> a strong decline in its use, particularly
            with respect to public employment. Indeed, only a few decades after Andrew Jackson's
            administration, strong discontent with the corruption and inefficiency of the patronage
            system of public employment eventuated in the Pendleton Act,<span class="sup">[7]</span>
            the foundation of modern civil service. And on the state and local levels, merit systems
            have increasingly displaced the practice.<span class="sup">[8]</span> This trend led the
            Court to observe in CSC v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 564 (1973), that "the
            judgment of Congress, the Executive, and the country appears to have been that partisan
            political activities by federal employees must be limited if the Government is to
            operate effectively and fairly, elections are to play their proper part in
            representative government, and employees themselves are to be sufficiently free from
            improper influences."</p>
         <p>The decline of patronage employment is not, of course, relevant to the question of its
            constitutionality. It is the practice itself, not the magnitude of its occurrence, the
            constitutionality of which must be determined. Nor for that matter does any
            unacceptability of the practice signified by its decline indicate its
            unconstitutionality. Our inquiry does not begin with the judgment of history, though the
            actual operation of a practice viewed in retrospect may help to assess its workings with
            respect to constitutional limitations. Compare Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S.
            483 (1954), with <span class="star-pagination">*355</span> Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S.
            537 (1896). Rather, inquiry must commence with identification of the constitutional
            limitations implicated by a challenged governmental practice.<span class="sup"
               >[9]</span>
         </p>
         <p/>
         <h2>V</h2>
         <p>The cost of the practice of patronage is the restraint it places on freedoms of belief
            and association. In order to maintain their jobs, respondents were required to pledge
            their political allegiance to the Democratic Party, work for the election of other
            candidates of the Democratic Party, contribute a portion of their wages to the Party, or
            obtain the sponsorship of a member of the Party, usually at the price of one of the
            first three alternatives. Regardless of the incumbent party's identity, Democratic or
            otherwise, the consequences for association and belief are the same. An individual who
            is a member of the out-party maintains affiliation with his own party at the risk of
            losing his job. He works for the election of his party's candidates and espouses its
            policies at the same risk. The financial and campaign assistance that he is induced to
            provide to another party furthers the advancement of that party's policies to the
            detriment of his party's views and ultimately his own beliefs, and any assessment of his
            salary is tantamount to coerced belief. See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 19 (1976).
            Even a pledge of allegiance to another party, however ostensible, only serves to
            compromise the individual's true beliefs. Since the average public employee is hardly in
            the financial position to support his party and another, or to lend his time to two
            parties, the <span class="star-pagination">*356</span> individual's ability to act
            according to his beliefs and to associate with others of his political persuasion is
            constrained, and support for his party is diminished.</p>
         <p>It is not only belief and association which are restricted where political patronage is
            the practice. The free functioning of the electoral process also suffers. Conditioning
            public employment on partisan support prevents support of competing political interests.
            Existing employees are deterred from such support, as well as the multitude seeking
            jobs. As government employment, state or federal, becomes more pervasive, the greater
            the dependence on it becomes, and therefore the greater becomes the power to starve
            political opposition by commanding partisan support, financial and otherwise. Patronage
            thus tips the electoral process in favor of the incumbent party, and where the
            practice's scope is substantial relative to the size of the electorate, the impact on
            the process can be significant.</p>
         <p>Our concern with the impact of patronage on political belief and association does not
            occur in the abstract, for political belief and association constitute the core of those
            activities protected by the First Amendment.<span class="sup">[10]</span> Regardless of
            the nature of the inducement, whether it be by the denial of public employment or, as in
            Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 (1943), by the influence of a teacher over
            students, "[i]f there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that
            no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics,
            nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word
            or act their faith therein." Id., at 642. And, though <span class="star-pagination"
               >*357</span> freedom of belief is central, "[t]he First Amendment protects political
            association as well as political expression." Buckley v. Valeo, supra, at 15. "There can
            no longer be any doubt that freedom to associate with others for the common advancement
            of political beliefs and ideas is a form of `orderly group activity' protected by the
            First and Fourteenth Amendments. NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 430; Bates v. Little
            Rock, 361 U. S. 516, 522-523; NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U. S. 449, 460-461. The right to
            associate with the political party of one's choice is an integral part of this basic
            constitutional freedom." Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U. S. 51, 56-57 (1973).</p>
         <p>These protections reflect our "profound national commitment to the principle that debate
            on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open," New York Times Co. v.
            Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 270 (1964), a principle itself reflective of the fundamental
            understanding that "[c]ompetition in ideas and governmental policies is at the core of
            our electoral process . . . ." Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U. S., at 32. Patronage,
            therefore, to the extent it compels or restrains belief and association, is inimical to
            the process which undergirds our system of government and is "at war with the deeper
            traditions of democracy embodied in the First Amendment." Illinois State Employees Union
            v. Lewis, 473 F. 2d, at 576. As such, the practice unavoidably confronts decisions by
            this Court either invalidating or recognizing as invalid government action that inhibits
            belief and association through the conditioning of public employment on political
            faith.</p>
         <p>The Court recognized in United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75, 100 (1947),
            that "Congress may not `enact a regulation providing that no Republican, Jew or Negro
            shall be appointed to federal office . . . .' " This <span class="star-pagination"
               >*358</span> principle was reaffirmed in Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183 (1952),
            which held that a State could not require its employees to establish their loyalty by
            extracting an oath denying past affiliation with Communists. And in Cafeteria Workers v.
            McElroy, 367 U. S. 886, 898 (1961), the Court recognized again that the government could
            not deny employment because of previous membership in a particular party.<span
               class="sup">[11]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Particularly pertinent to the constitutionality of the practice of patronage dismissals
            are Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U. S. 589 (1967), and Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.
            S. 593 (1972). In Keyishian, the Court invalidated New York statutes barring employment
            merely on the basis of membership in "subversive" organizations. Keyishian squarely held
            that political association alone could not, consistently with the First Amendment,
            constitute <span class="star-pagination">*359</span> an adequate ground for denying
            public employment.<span class="sup">[12]</span> In Perry, the Court broadly rejected the
            validity of limitations on First Amendment rights as a condition to the receipt of a
            governmental benefit, stating that the government "may not deny a benefit to a person on
            a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests&#x97;especially, his
            interest in freedom of speech. For if the government could deny a benefit to a person
            because of his constitutionally protected speech or associations, his exercise of those
            freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited. This would allow the government to
            `produce a result which [it] could not command directly.' Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S.
            513, 526. Such interference with constitutional rights is impermissible." 408 U. S., at
            597.</p>
         <p>Patronage practice falls squarely within the prohibitions of Keyishian and Perry. Under
            that practice, public employees hold their jobs on the condition that they provide, in
            some acceptable manner, support for the favored political party. The threat of dismissal
            for failure to provide that support unquestionably inhibits protected belief and
            association, and dismissal for failure to provide support only penalizes its exercise.
            The belief and association which government may not ordain directly are achieved by
               indirection.<span class="sup">[13]</span> And <span class="star-pagination"
               >*360</span> regardless of how evenhandedly these restraints may operate in the long
            run, after political office has changed hands several times, protected interests are
            still infringed and thus the violation remains.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>VI</h2>
         <p>Although the practice of patronage dismissals clearly infringes First Amendment
            interests, our inquiry is not at an end, for the prohibition on encroachment of First
            Amendment protections is not an absolute. Restraints are permitted for appropriate
            reasons. Keyishian and Perry, however, not only serve to establish a presumptive
            prohibition on infringement, but also serve to dispose of one suggested by petitioners'
            reference to this Court's affirmance by an equally divided court in Bailey v.
            Richardson, 341 U. S. 918 (1951), aff'g 86 U. S. App. D. C. 248, 182 F. 2d 46
               (1950).<span class="sup">[14]</span> That is the notion that because there is no
            right to a government benefit, such as public employment, the benefit may be denied for
            any reason. Perry, however, emphasized that "[f]or at least a quarter-century, this
            Court has made clear that even though a person has no `right' to a valuable governmental
            benefit and even though the government may <span class="star-pagination">*361</span>
            deny him the benefit for any number of reasons, there are some reasons upon which the
            government may not rely." 408 U. S., at 597. Perry and Keyishian properly recognize one
            such impermissible reason: The denial of a public benefit may not be used by the
            government for the purpose of creating an incentive enabling it to achieve what it may
            not command directly. " `[T]he theory that public employment which may be denied
            altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless of how unreasonable, has been
            uniformly rejected.' " Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U. S., at 605-606. "It is too
            late in the day to doubt that the liberties of religion and expression may be infringed
            by the denial of or placing of conditions upon a benefit or privilege." Sherbert v.
            Verner, 374 U. S. 398, 404 (1963). " `[T]his Court now has rejected the concept that
            constitutional rights turn upon whether a governmental benefit is characterized as a
            "right" or as a "privilege." ' " Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U. S. 634, 644 (1973) (quoting
            Graham v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 365, 374 (1971)).<span class="sup">[15]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*362</span> While the right-privilege distinction
            furnishes no ground on which to justify patronage, petitioners raise several other
            justifications requiring consideration. Before examining those justifications, however,
            it is necessary to have in mind the standards according to which their sufficiency is to
            be measured. It is firmly established that a significant impairment of First Amendment
            rights must survive exacting scrutiny. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 64-65; NAACP v.
            Alabama, 357 U. S. 449, 460-461 (1958). "This type of scrutiny is necessary even if any
            deterrent effect on the exercise of First Amendment rights arises, not through direct
            government action, but indirectly as an unintended but inevitable result of the
            government's conduct . . . ." Buckley v. Valeo, supra, at 65. Thus encroachment "cannot
            be justified upon a mere showing of a legitimate state interest." Kusper v. Pontikes,
            414 U. S., at 58. The interest advanced must be paramount, one of vital importance, and
            the burden is on the government to show the existence of such an interest. Buckley v.
            Valeo, supra, at 94; Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U. S., at 31-33; NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S.
            415, 438, 444 (1963); Bates v. Little Rock, 361 U. S. 516, 524 (1960); NAACP v. Alabama,
            supra, at 464-466; Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S. 516, 530 (1945). In the instant case,
            care must be taken not to confuse the interest of partisan organizations with
            governmental interests. Only the latter will suffice. Moreover, it is not enough that
            the means chosen in furtherance of the interest be rationally related to that end.
            Sherbert v. Verner, supra, at 406. The gain to the subordinating interest provided by
            the means must outweigh the incurred loss of protected rights, see United Public Workers
            v. Mitchell, 330 U. S., at 96,<span class="sup">[16]</span> and the government must
            "emplo[y] means <span class="star-pagination">*363</span> closely drawn to avoid
            unnecessary abridgment . . . ." Buckley v. Valeo, supra, at 25. "[A] State may not
            choose means that unnecessarily restrict constitutionally protected liberty. `Precision
            of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious
            freedoms.' If the State has open to it a less drastic way of satisfying its legitimate
            interests, it may not choose a legislative scheme that broadly stifles the exercise of
            fundamental personal liberties." Kusper v. Pontikes, supra, at 59 (citations omitted).
            See United States v. Robel, 389 U. S. 258 (1967); Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U. S. 479
            (1960). In short, if conditioning the retention of public employment on the employee's
            support of the in-party is to survive constitutional challenge, it must further some
            vital government end by a means that is least restrictive of freedom of belief and
            association in achieving that end, and the benefit gained must outweigh the loss of
            constitutionally protected rights.<span class="sup">[17]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*364</span> One interest which has been offered in
            justification of patronage is the need to insure effective government and the efficiency
            of public employees. It is argued that employees of political persuasions not the same
            as that of the party in control of public office will not have the incentive to work
            effectively and may even be motivated to subvert the incumbent administration's efforts
            to govern effectively. We are not persuaded. The inefficiency resulting from the
            wholesale replacement of large numbers of public employees every time political office
            changes hands belies this justification. And the prospect of dismissal after an election
            in which the incumbent party has lost is only a disincentive to good work.<span
               class="sup">[18]</span> Further, it is not clear that dismissal in order to make room
            for a patronage appointment will result in replacement <span class="star-pagination"
               >*365</span> by a person more qualified to do the job since appointment often occurs
            in exchange for the delivery of votes, or other party service, not job capability. More
            fundamentally, however, the argument does not succeed because it is doubtful that the
            mere difference of political persuasion motivates poor performance; nor do we think it
            legitimately may be used as a basis for imputing such behavior. The Court has
            consistently recognized that mere political association is an inadequate basis for
            imputing disposition to ill-willed conduct. See Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.
            S., at 606-608; Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U. S. 11, 19 (1966); Wieman v. Updegraff, 344
            U. S., at 190-191.<span class="sup">[19]</span> Though those cases involved affiliation
            with the Communist Party, we do not "consider <span class="star-pagination">*366</span>
            these [respondents'] interest in freely associating with members of the [Republican]
            Party less worthy of protection than [other] employees' interest in associating with
            Communists or former Communists." Illinois State Employees Union v. Lewis, 473 F. 2d, at
            570. At all events, less drastic means for insuring government effectiveness and
            employee efficiency are available to the State. Specifically, employees may always be
            discharged for good cause, such as insubordination or poor job performance, when those
            bases in fact exist.</p>
         <p>Even if the first argument that patronage serves effectiveness and efficiency be
            rejected, it still may be argued that patronage serves those interests by giving the
            employees of an incumbent party the incentive to perform well in order to insure their
            party's incumbency and thereby their jobs. Patronage, according to the argument, thus
            makes employees highly accountable to the public. But the ability of officials more
            directly accountable to the electorate to discharge employees for cause and the
            availability of merit systems, growth in the use of which has been quite significant,
            convince us that means less intrusive than patronage still exist for achieving
            accountability in the public work force and, thereby, effective and efficient
            government. The greater effectiveness of patronage over these less drastic means, if
            any, is at best marginal, a gain outweighed by the absence of intrusion on protected
            interests under the alternatives.</p>
         <p>The lack of any justification for patronage dismissals as a means of furthering
            government effectiveness and efficiency distinguishes this case from CSC v. Letter
            Carriers, 413 U. S. 548 (1973), and United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75
            (1949). In both of those cases, legislative restraints on political management and
            campaigning by public employees were upheld despite their encroachment on First
            Amendment rights <span class="star-pagination">*367</span> because, inter alia, they did
            serve in a necessary manner to foster and protect efficient and effective
               government.<span class="sup">[20]</span> Interestingly, the activities that were
            restrained by the legislation involved in those cases are characteristic of patronage
            practices. As the Court observed in Mitchell: "The conviction that an actively partisan
            governmental personnel threatens good administration has deepened since [1882]. Congress
            recognizes danger to the service in that political rather than official effort may earn
            advancement and to the public in that governmental favor may be channeled through
            political connections." 330 U. S., at 97-98.</p>
         <p>A second interest advanced in support of patronage is the need for political loyalty of
            employees, not to the end that effectiveness and efficiency be insured, but to the end
            that representative government not be undercut by tactics obstructing the implementation
            of policies of the new administration, policies presumably sanctioned by the electorate.
            The justification is not without force, but is nevertheless inadequate to validate
            patronage wholesale. Limiting patronage dismissals to policymaking positions is
            sufficient to achieve this governmental end. Nonpolicymaking individuals usually have
            only limited responsibility and are therefore not in a position to thwart the goals of
            the in-party.</p>
         <p>No clear line can be drawn between policymaking and nonpolicymaking positions. While
            nonpolicymaking individuals usually have limited responsibility, that is not to say that
            one with a number of responsibilities is necessarily in a policymaking position. The
            nature of the responsibilities is critical. Employee supervisors, for <span
               class="star-pagination">*368</span> example, may have many responsibilities, but
            those responsibilities may have only limited and well-defined objectives. An employee
            with responsibilities that are not well defined or are of broad scope more likely
            functions in a policymaking position. In determining whether an employee occupies a
            policymaking position, consideration should also be given to whether the employee acts
            as an adviser or formulates plans for the implementation of broad goals. Thus, the
            political loyalty "justification is a matter of proof, or at least argument, directed at
            particular kinds of jobs." Illinois State Employees Union v. Lewis, 473 F. 2d, at 574.
            Since, as we have noted, it is the government's burden to demonstrate an overriding
            interest in order to validate an encroachment on protected interests, the burden of
            establishing this justification as to any particular respondent will rest on the
            petitioners on remand, cases of doubt being resolved in favor of the particular
            respondent.</p>
         <p>It is argued that a third interest supporting patronage dismissals is the preservation
            of the democratic process. According to petitioners, " `we have contrived no system for
            the support of party that does not place considerable reliance on patronage. The party
            organization makes a democratic government work and charges a price for its services.'
               "<span class="sup">[21]</span> The argument is thus premised on the centrality of
            partisan politics to the democratic process.</p>
         <p>Preservation of the democratic process is certainly an interest protection of which may
            in some instances justify limitations on First Amendment freedoms. See Buckley v. Valeo,
            424 U. S. 1 (1976); CSC v. Letter Carriers, supra; Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U. S. 23
            (1968); United Public Workers v. Mitchell, supra. But however important <span
               class="star-pagination">*369</span> preservation of the two-party system or any
            system involving a fixed number of parties may or may not be,<span class="sup"
               >[22]</span>Williams v. Rhodes, supra, at 32, we are not persuaded that the
            elimination of patronage practice or, as is specifically involved here, the interdiction
            of patronage dismissals, will bring about the demise of party politics. Political
            parties existed in the absence of active patronage practice prior to the administration
            of Andrew Jackson, and they have survived substantial reduction in their patronage power
            through the establishment of merit systems.<span class="sup">[23]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Patronage dismissals thus are not the least restrictive alternative to achieving the
            contribution they may make to the democratic process.<span class="sup">[24]</span> The
            process functions as well without the practice, perhaps even better, for patronage
            dismissals clearly also retard that process. Patronage can result in the entrenchment of
            one or a few parties to the exclusion of others. And most indisputably, as we recognized
            at the outset, patronage is a very effective impediment to the associational and speech
            freedoms which <span class="star-pagination">*370</span> are essential to a meaningful
            system of democratic government. Thus, if patronage contributes at all to the elective
            process, that contribution is diminished by the practice's impairment of the same.
            Indeed, unlike the gain to representative government provided by the Hatch Act in CSC v.
            Letter Carriers, supra, and United Public Workers v. Mitchell, supra, the gain to
            representative government provided by the practice of patronage, if any, would be
            insufficient to justify its sacrifice of First Amendment rights.<span class="sup"
               >[25]</span>
         </p>
         <p>To be sure, Letter Carriers and Mitchell upheld Hatch Act restraints sacrificing
            political campaigning and management, <span class="star-pagination">*371</span>
            activities themselves protected by the First Amendment. But in those cases it was the
            Court's judgment that congressional subordination of those activities was permissible to
            safeguard the core interests of individual belief and association.<span class="sup"
               >[26]</span> Subordination of some First Amendment activity was permissible to
            protect other such activity. Today, we hold that subordination of other First Amendment
            activity, that is, patronage dismissals, not only is permissible, but also is mandated
            by the First Amendment. And since patronage dismissals fall within the category of
            political campaigning and management, this conclusion irresistibly flows from Mitchell
            and Letter Carriers. For if the First Amendment did not place individual belief and
            association above political campaigning and management, at least in the setting of
            public employment, the restraints on those latter activities could not have been judged
            permissible in Mitchell and Letter Carriers.<span class="sup">[27]</span>
         </p>
         <p>It is apparent that at bottom we are required to engage in the resolution of conflicting
            interests under the First Amendment. The constitutional adjudication called for <span
               class="star-pagination">*372</span> by this task is well within our province.<span
               class="sup">[28]</span> The illuminating source to which we turn in performing the
            task is the system of government the First Amendment was intended to protect, a
            democratic system whose proper functioning is indispensably dependent on the unfettered
            judgment of each citizen on matters of political concern. Our decision in obedience to
            the guidance of that source does not outlaw political parties or political campaigning
            and management. Parties are free to exist and their concomitant activities are free to
            continue. We require only that the rights of every citizen to believe as he will and to
            act and associate according to his beliefs be free to continue as well.</p>
         <p>In summary, patronage dismissals severely restrict political belief and association.
            Though there is a vital need for government efficiency and effectiveness, such
            dismissals are on balance not the least restrictive means for fostering that end. There
            is also a need to insure that policies which the electorate has sanctioned are
            effectively implemented. That interest can be fully satisfied by limiting patronage
            dismissals to policymaking positions. Finally, patronage dismissals cannot be justified
            by their contribution to the proper functioning of our democratic process through their
            assistance to partisan politics since political parties are nurtured by other, less
            intrusive and <span class="star-pagination">*373</span> equally effective methods. More
            fundamentally, however, any contribution of patronage dismissals to the democratic
            process does not suffice to override their severe encroachment on First Amendment
            freedoms. We hold, therefore, that the practice of patronage dismissals is
            unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and that respondents thus
            stated a valid claim for relief.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>VII</h2>
         <p>There remains the question whether the issuance of a preliminary injunction was properly
            directed by the Court of Appeals. The District Court predicated its denial of
            respondents' motion for a preliminary injunction on its finding that the allegations in
            their complaints and affidavits did not constitute a sufficient showing of irreparable
            injury and that respondents had an adequate remedy at law. The Court of Appeals held,
            however: "Inasmuch as this case involves First Amendment rights of association which
            must be carefully guarded against infringement by public office holders, we judge that
            injunctive relief is clearly appropriate in these cases." 509 F. 2d, at 1136. We
            agree.</p>
         <p>At the time a preliminary injunction was sought in the District Court, one of the
            respondents was only threatened with discharge. In addition, many of the members of the
            class respondents were seeking to have certified prior to the dismissal of their
            complaint were threatened with discharge or had agreed to provide support for the
            Democratic Party in order to avoid discharge. It is clear therefore that First Amendment
            interests were either threatened or in fact being impaired at the time relief was
            sought. The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time,
            unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury. See New York Times Co. <span
               class="star-pagination">*374</span> v. United States, 403 U. S. 713 (1971).<span
               class="sup">[29]</span> Since such injury was both threatened and occurring at the
            time of respondents' motion and since respondents sufficiently demonstrated a
            probability of success on the merits, the Court of Appeals might properly have held that
            the District Court abused its discretion in denying preliminary injunctive relief. See
            Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U. S. 58, 67 (1963).</p>
         <p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>
         <p>Affirmed.</p>

         <p>This case does not require us to consider the broad contours of the so-called patronage

            governmental employees to those of a particular political party, and I would intimate no
            views whatever on that question.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*375</span> The single substantive question involved in
            this case is whether a nonpolicymaking, nonconfidential government employee can be
            discharged or threatened with discharge from a job that he is satisfactorily performing
            upon the sole ground of his political beliefs. I agree with the plurality that he
            cannot. See Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593, 597-598.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="dissent" judge="burger"><p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, dissenting.</p>
         <p>The Court's decision today represents a significant intrusion into the area of
            legislative and policy concerns &#x97;the sort of intrusion MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN has
            recently protested in other contexts. I therefore join MR. JUSTICE POWELL'S dissenting
            opinion, and add a few words simply to emphasize an aspect that seems particularly
            important to me.</p>
         <p>The Illinois Legislature has pointedly decided that roughly half of the Sheriff's staff
            shall be made up of tenured career personnel and the balance left exclusively to the
            choice of the elected head of the department. The Court strains the rational bounds of
            First Amendment doctrine and runs counter to longstanding practices that are part of the
            fabric of our democratic system to hold that the Constitution commands something it has
            not been thought to require for 185 years. For all that time our system has wisely left
            these matters to the States and, on the federal level, to the Congress. The Court's
            action is a classic example of trivializing constitutional adjudication&#x97;a function
            of the highest importance in our system.</p>
         <p>Only last week, in National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976), we took
            steps to arrest the downgrading of States to a role comparable to the departments of
            France, governed entirely out of the national capital. Constant inroads on the powers of
            the States <span class="star-pagination">*376</span> to manage their own affairs cannot
            fail to complicate our system and centralize more power in Washington. For the reasons
            MR. JUSTICE POWELL persuasively adduces, the First Amendment neither requires nor
            justifies such inroads in this case. In my view, the issue is not so much whether the
            patronage system is "good" or "bad," as the plurality characterizes the problem, but
            whether the choice of its use in the management of the very government of each State was
            not, in the words of the Tenth Amendment, "reserved to the States . . . or to the
            people."</p>
         <p>Congress long ago, as a matter of policy, opted for a federal career service with a
            small number of purely political appointments in the Executive Branch, and many
            governmental departments have a limited number of positions in which the persons
            appointed have no tenure but serve at the pleasure of the cabinet officer or agency
            chief, who in turn serves at the pleasure of the President. See, e. g., Leonard v.
            Douglas, 116 U. S. App. D. C. 136, 321 F. 2d 749 (1963). The considerations leading to
            these legislative conclusions are&#x97;for me&#x97;not open to judicial scrutiny under
            the guise of a First Amendment claim, any more than is the right of a newly elected
            Representative or Senator, for example, to have a staff made up of persons who share his
            political philosophy and affiliation and are loyal to him. It seems to me that the
            Illinois Legislature's choice is entitled to no less deference.</p></div>

         <p>MR. JUSTICE POWELL, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST join,
            dissenting.</p>
         <p>The Court holds unconstitutional a practice as old as the Republic, a practice which has
            contributed significantly to the democratization of American politics. This decision is
            urged on us in the name of First Amendment rights, but in my view the judgment neither
            is constitutionally <span class="star-pagination">*377</span> required nor serves the
            interest of a representative democracy. It also may well disserve&#x97;rather than
            promote&#x97;core values of the First Amendment. I therefore dissent.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>The Cook County Sheriff's Office employs approximately 3,000 people. Roughly half of
            these employees are "merit" employees given various protections from discharge. The
            other half of the employees have no such protection. Customary Illinois political
            practice has allowed such "nonmerit" positions to be awarded on "patronage" grounds.
            This tradition has entitled newly elected officeholders to replace incumbent nonmerit
            employees with patronage appointments.</p>
         <p>Petitioner Richard Elrod, a Democrat, was elected Sheriff of Cook County in 1970,
            succeeding a Republican. Consistently with Illinois practice, he dismissed a number of
            incumbent employees because they lacked Democratic affiliation and were unable to secure
            Democratic sponsorship. The named respondents, several discharged employees and another
            employee threatened with discharge, are all Republicans who concededly were hired by
            Elrod's predecessor because of their political affiliations.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>As the plurality opinion recognizes, patronage practices of the sort under consideration
            here have a long history in America.<span class="sup">[1]</span> Although an extensive
            recounting of that history is not necessary, I think it important to <span
               class="star-pagination">*378</span> survey it more fully than does the plurality
               opinion.<span class="sup">[2]</span> The observation that patronage in employment
            received its primary popularization and legitimation during Jackson's Presidency, ante,
            at 353, understates the historical antecedents of the practice, which stretch back to
            Washington's Presidency.</p>
         <p>Partisan politics, as we now know them, did not assume a prominent role in national
            politics immediately after the adoption of the Constitution. Nonetheless, Washington
            tended to confine appointments even of customs officials and postmasters to <ref type="" num="">Federalist</ref>s,
            as opposed to anti- Federalists. As the role of parties expanded, partisan considerations
            quickly influenced employment decisions. John Adams removed some Republicans from minor
            posts, and Jefferson, the first President to succeed a President of an opposing party,
            made significant patronage use of the appointment and removal powers. The
            administrations of Madison, Monroe, and John Quincy Adams provided no occasion for
            conspicuous patronage practice in employment, as each succeeded a copartisan. Jackson,
            of course, used patronage extensively when he became the first President since Jefferson
            to succeed an antagonistic administration.</p>
         <p>It thus appears that patronage employment practices emerged on the national level at an
            early date, and that they were conspicuous during Jackson's Presidency largely because
            of their necessary dormancy during the long succession of Republican Presidents. During
            that period, however, patronage in hiring was practiced widely in the States, especially
            in New York and Pennsylvania. This afforded a theoretical and popular legitimacy to
            patronage, helping to lay the groundwork for acceptance of Jackson's actions on the
            national level.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*379</span> It is recognized that patronage in employment
            played a significant role in democratizing American politics. See, e. g., C. Fish, The
            Civil Service and the Patronage 156-157 (1905); Sorauf, Patronage and Party, 3 Midwest
            J. Pol. Sci. 115-116 (1959). Before patronage practices developed fully, an
            "aristocratic" class dominated political affairs, a tendency that persisted in areas
            where patronage did not become prevalent. C. Fish, supra, at 157. Patronage practices
            broadened the base of political participation by providing incentives to take part in
            the process, thereby increasing the volume of political discourse in society. Patronage
            also strengthened parties, and hence encouraged the development of institutional
            responsibility to the electorate on a permanent basis. Parties became "instrument[s]
            through which discipline and responsibility may be achieved within the Leviathan."
            Sorauf, supra, at 115.</p>
         <p>In many situations patronage employment practices also entailed costs to government
            efficiency. These costs led eventually to reforms placing most federal and state civil
            service employment on a nonpatronage basis. But the course of such reform is of limited
            relevance to the task of constitutional adjudication in this case. It is pertinent to
            note, however, that a perceived impingement on employees' political beliefs by the
            patronage system was not a significant impetus to such reform. Most advocates of reform
            were concerned primarily with the corruption and inefficiency that patronage was thought
            to induce in civil service and the power that patronage practices were thought to give
            the "professional" politicians who relied on them. D. Rosenbloom, Federal Service and
            the Constitution 70-74 (1971). Moreover, it generally was thought that elimination of
            these evils required the imposition both of a merit system and of restrictions on First
            Amendment activities <span class="star-pagination">*380</span> by government employees.
            Id., at 76-77, 82-86; see, e. g., CSC v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548 (1973).</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>It might well be possible to dispose of this case on the ground that it implicates no
            First Amendment right of the respondents, and therefore that they have failed to state a
            cause of action. They are employees seeking to avoid discharge&#x97;not citizens
            desiring an opportunity to be hired by the county without regard to their political
            affiliation or loyalty. Respondents' complaint acknowledges the longstanding existence
            of the patronage system they now challenge:</p> "For many years past and continuing to
         this time it has been the practice of the elected Sheriff of Cook County, when he assumes
         office from a Sheriff of a different political party, to replace all or substantially all
         of the non-civil service employees of the Sheriff's office who did not (a) Pledge their
         political allegiance to the political party of the incoming Sheriff; [and/or meet other
         specified political requirements]. . . ." App. 3. <p>We thus have complaining employees who
            apparently accepted patronage jobs knowingly and willingly, while fully familiar with
            the "tenure" practices long prevailing in the Sheriff's Office. Such employees have
            benefited from their political beliefs and activities; they have not been penalized for
            them. In these circumstances, I am inclined to agree with the holding of the Supreme
            Court of Pennsylvania in American Federation of State Employees v. Shapp, <span

         <p>The plurality opinion virtually ignores this issue in <span class="star-pagination"

         <p>The question is whether it is consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments for a
            State to offer some employment conditioned, explicitly or implicitly, on partisan
            political affiliation and on the political fortunes of the incumbent officeholder. This
            is to be determined, as the plurality opinion agrees, by whether patronage hiring
            practices sufficiently advance important state interests to justify the consequent
            burdening of First Amendment interests. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 25 (1976); ante,
            at 360-363. It is difficult to disagree with the view, as an abstract proposition, that
            government employment ordinarily should not be conditioned upon one's political beliefs
            or activities. But we deal <span class="star-pagination">*382</span> here with a highly
            practical and rather fundamental element of our political system, not the theoretical
            abstractions of a political science seminar. In concluding that patronage hiring
            practices are unconstitutional, the plurality seriously underestimates the strength of
            the government interest&#x97;especially at the local level&#x97;in allowing some
            patronage hiring practices, and it exaggerates the perceived burden on First Amendment
               rights.<span class="sup">[5]</span>
         </p>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>As indicated above, patronage hiring practices have contributed to American democracy by
            stimulating political activity and by strengthening parties, thereby helping to make
            government accountable.<span class="sup">[6]</span> It cannot be questioned seriously
            that these contributions promote important state interests. Earlier this Term we said of
            the government interest in encouraging political debate:</p> "[Public financing of
         Presidential campaigns] is . . . [an effort] to use public money to facilitate and enlarge
         public discussion and participation in the electoral process, goals vital to a
         self-governing people." Buckley v. Valeo supra, at 92-93 (footnote omitted). <span
            class="star-pagination">*383</span> "Legislation to enhance these First Amendment values
         is the rule, not the exception. Our statute books are replete with laws providing financial
         assistance to the exercise of free speech . . . ." Id., at 93 n. 127. <p>We also have
            recognized the strong government interests in encouraging stable political parties and
            avoiding excessive political fragmentation. Through the medium of established parties
            the "people . . . are presented with understandable choices and the winner in the
            general election with sufficient support to govern effectively," Storer v. Brown, 415 U.
            S. 724, 735 (1974), while "splintered parties and unrestrained factionalism [might] do
            significant damage to the fabric of government." Id., at 736. See Buckley v. Valeo,
            supra, at 98, 101.</p>
         <p>Without analysis, however, the plurality opinion disparages the contribution of
            patronage hiring practices in advancing these state interests. It merely asserts that
            such practices cause the "free functioning of the electoral process [to suffer]," ante,
            at 356, and that "we are not persuaded that the elimination of . . . patronage
            dismissals, will bring about the demise of party politics." Ante, at 369. One cannot
            avoid the impression, however, that even a threatened demise of parties would not
            trouble the plurality. In my view, this thinking reflects a disturbing insensitivity to
            the political realities relevant to the disposition of this case.<span class="sup"
               >[7]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The complaining parties are or were employees of the Sheriff. In many communities, the
            sheriff's duties are as routine as process serving, and his election attracts little or
            no general public interest. In the States, and <span class="star-pagination">*384</span>
            especially in the thousands of local communities, there are large numbers of elective
            offices, and many are as relatively obscure as that of the local sheriff or constable.
            Despite the importance of elective offices to the ongoing work of local governments,
            election campaigns for lesser offices in particular usually attract little attention
            from the media, with consequent disinterest and absence of intelligent participation on
            the part of the public. Unless the candidates for these offices are able to dispense the
            traditional patronage that has accrued to the offices, they also are unlikely to attract
            donations of time or money from voluntary groups. In short, the resource pools that fuel
            the intensity of political interest and debate in "important" elections frequently
            "could care less" about who fills the offices deemed to be relatively unimportant. Long
            experience teaches that at this local level traditional patronage practices contribute
            significantly to the democratic process. The candidates for these offices derive their
            support at the precinct level, and their modest funding for publicity, from cadres of
            friends and political associates who hope to benefit if their "man" is elected.<span
               class="sup">[8]</span> The activities of the latter are <span class="star-pagination"
               >*385</span> often the principal source of political information for the voting
            public. The "robust" political discourse that the plurality opinion properly emphasizes
            is furthered&#x97;not restricted&#x97;by the time-honored system.</p>
         <p>Patronage hiring practices also enable party organizations to persist and function at
            the local level. Such organizations become visible to the electorate at large only at
            election time, but the dull periods between elections require ongoing activities:
            precinct organizations must be maintained; new voters registered; and minor political
            "chores" performed for citizens who otherwise may have no practical means of access to
            officeholders. In some communities, party organizations and clubs also render helpful
            social services.</p>
         <p>It is naive to think that these types of political activities are motivated at these
            levels by some academic interest in "democracy" or other public service impulse. For the
            most part, as every politician knows, the hope of some reward generates a major portion
            of the local political activity supporting parties. It is difficult to overestimate the
            contributions to our system by the major political parties, fortunately limited in
            number compared to the fractionalization that has made the continued existence of
            democratic government doubtful in some other countries. Parties generally are stable,
            high-profile, and permanent institutions. When the names on a long ballot are
            meaningless to the average voter, party affiliation affords a guidepost by which voters
            may rationalize a myriad of political choices. Cf. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at
            66-68. Voters can and do hold parties to long-term accountability, and it is not too
            much to say that, in their absence, responsive and responsible performance in
            low-profile offices, particularly, is difficult to maintain.</p>
         <p>It is against decades of experience to the contrary, then, that the plurality opinion
            concludes that patronage <span class="star-pagination">*386</span> hiring practices
            interfere with the "free functioning of the electoral process." Ante, at 356. This ad
            hoc judicial judgment runs counter to the judgments of the representatives of the people
            in state and local governments, representatives who have chosen, in most instances, to
            retain some patronage practices in combination with a merit-oriented civil service. One
            would think that elected representatives of the people are better equipped than we to
            weigh the need for some continuation of patronage practices in light of the interests
            above identified,<span class="sup">[9]</span> and particularly in view of local
               conditions.<span class="sup">[10]</span> See CSC v. <span class="star-pagination"
               >*387</span> Letter Carriers, 413 U. S., at 564; United Public Workers v. Mitchell,
            330 U. S. 75, 99 (1947). Against this background, the assertion in the plurality opinion
            that "[p]atronage dismissals . . . are not the least restrictive alternative to
            achieving [any] contribution they may make to the democratic process" is unconvincing,
            especially since no alternative to some continuation of patronage practices is
            suggested. Ante, at 369 (footnote omitted).</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B</h2>
         <p>I thus conclude that patronage hiring practices sufficiently serve important state
            interests, including some interests sought to be advanced by the First Amendment, to
            justify a tolerable intrusion on the First Amendment interests of employees or potential
            employees.</p>
         <p>The plurality opinion asserts that patronage hiring practices contravene the fundamental
            principle that " `no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in
            politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion . . . .' " Ante, at 356,
            quoting Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642 (1943). But such practices
            simply cannot be so construed. This case differs materially from previous cases
            involving the imposition of political conditions on employment, see, e. g., Garner v.
            Los Angeles Board, 341 U. S. 716 (1951), cases where there was an attempt to exclude "a
            minority group . . . odious to the majority." Id., at 725 (Frankfurter, J., concurring
            in part and dissenting in part). In that context there was a danger that governmental
            action was directed toward the elimination of political beliefs <span
               class="star-pagination">*388</span> by penalizing adherents to them. But patronage
            hiring practices have been consistent historically with vigorous ideological competition
            in the political "marketplace." And even after one becomes a beneficiary, the system
            leaves significant room for individual political expression. Employees, regardless of
            affiliation, may vote freely<span class="sup">[11]</span> and express themselves on some
            political issues. See Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593 (1972); Pickering v. Board of
            Education, 391 U. S. 563 (1968). The principal intrusion of patronage hiring practices
            on First Amendment interests thus arises from the coercion on associational choices that
            may be created by one's desire initially to obtain employment. This intrusion, while not
            insignificant, must be measured in light of the limited role of patronage hiring in most
            government employment. The pressure to abandon one's beliefs and associations to obtain
            government employment&#x97;especially employment of such uncertain duration&#x97;does
            not seem to me to assume impermissible proportions in light of the interests to be
            served.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>V</h2>
         <p>On the assumption that we must reach the constitutional issue at the behest of
            respondents, I would hold that a state or local government may elect to condition
            employment on the political affiliation of a prospective employee and on the political
            fortunes of the hiring incumbent. History and long-prevailing practice across the
            country support the view that patronage hiring practices make a sufficiently substantial
            contribution to the practical functioning of our democratic system to support <span
               class="star-pagination">*389</span> their relatively modest intrusion on First
            Amendment interests. The judgment today unnecessarily constitutionalizes another element
            of American life&#x97;an element certainly not without its faults but one which
            generations have accepted on balance as having merit.<span class="sup">[12]</span> We
            should have heeded, instead, the admonition of Mr. Justice Holmes that "[i]f a thing has
            been practised for two hundred years by common consent, it will need a strong case for
            the Fourteenth Amendment to affect it . . . ." Jackman v. Rosenbaum Co., 260 U. S. 22,

            systems. New methods of political financing, the greater necessity of job expertise in
            public employment, growing issue orientation in the elective process, and new incentives

            directly upon the State it is the more specific limiting principles of the First
            Amendment that finally govern this case." Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624,
            639 (1943).</p>
         <p>[11] Protection of First Amendment interests has not been limited to invalidation of
            conditions on government employment requiring allegiance to a particular political
            party. This Court's decisions have prohibited conditions on public benefits, in the form
            of jobs or otherwise, which dampen the exercise generally of First Amendment rights,
            however slight the inducement to the individual to forsake those rights. </p>
         <p>In Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U. S. 488 (1961), decided the same day as Cafeteria Workers,
            the Court squarely held that a citizen could not be refused a public office for failure
            to declare his belief in God. More broadly, the Court has held impermissible under the
            First Amendment the dismissal of a high school teacher for openly criticizing the Board
            of Education on its allocation of school funds. Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.
            S. 563 (1968). And in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963), unemployment
            compensation, rather than public employment, was the government benefit which could not
            be withheld on the condition that a person accept Saturday employment where such
            employment was contrary to religious faith. Similarly, the First Amendment prohibits
            limiting the grant of a tax exemption to only those who affirm their loyalty to the
            State granting the exemption. Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513 (1958).</p>
         <p>[12] Thereafter, United States v. Robel, 389 U. S. 258 (1967), similarly held that mere
            membership in the Communist Party could not bar a person from employment in private
            defense establishments important to national security.</p>
         <p>[13] The increasingly pervasive nature of public employment provides officials with
            substantial power through conditioning jobs on partisan support, particularly in this
            time of high unemployment. Since the government, however, may not seek to achieve an
            unlawful end either directly or indirectly, the inducement afforded by placing
            conditions on a benefit need not be particularly great in order to find that rights have
            been violated. Rights are infringed both where the government fines a person a penny for
            being a Republican and where it withholds the grant of a penny for the same reason. </p>
         <p>Petitioners contend that even though the government may not provide that public
            employees may retain their jobs only if they become affiliated with or provide support
            for the in-party, respondents here have waived any objection to such requirements. The
            difficulty with this argument is that it completely swallows the rule. Since the
            qualification may not be constitutionally imposed absent an appropriate justification,
            to accept the waiver argument is to say that the government may do what it may not do. A
            finding of waiver in this case, therefore, would be contrary to our view that a partisan
            job qualification abridges the First Amendment.</p>
         <p>[14] Brief for Petitioners 12-13.</p>
         <p>[15] See also Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 571 n. 9 (1972): </p>
         <p>"In a leading case decided many years ago, the Court of Appeals for the District of
            Columbia Circuit held that public employment in general was a `privilege,' not a
            `right,' and that procedural due process guarantees therefore were inapplicable. Bailey
            v. Richardson, 86 U. S. App. D. C. 248, 182 F. 2d 46, aff'd by an equally divided Court,
            341 U. S. 918. The basis of this holding has been thoroughly undermined in the ensuing
            years. For, as MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN wrote for the Court only last year, `this Court now
            has rejected the concept that constitutional rights turn upon whether a governmental
            benefit is characterized as a "right" or as a "privilege." ' Graham v. Richardson, 403
            U. S. 365, 374. See, e. g., Morrissey v. Brewer, ante, at 482; Bell v. Burson, [402 U.

         <p>[16] "[T]his Court must balance the extent of the guarantees of freedom against a
            congressional enactment to protect a democratic society against the supposed evil of
            political partisanship by classified employees of government." United Public Workers v.
            Mitchell, 330 U. S., at 96.</p>
         <p>[17] The Court's decision in United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968), does not
            support petitioners. O'Brien dealt with the constitutionality of laws regulating the
            "nonspeech" elements of expressive conduct. No such regulation is involved here, for it
            is association and belief per se, not any particular form of conduct, which patronage
            seeks to control. Moreover, while partisanship may involve activities such as
            registering with a political organization, wearing a campaign button, or contributing to
            a campaign fund, we cannot say these activities can be equated with such conduct as
            destruction of a draft card which was involved in O'Brien. See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.
            S. 1, 17 (1976). Finally, to paraphrase the Court's observations in Buckley: "Even if
            the categorization of [partisan activity] as conduct were accepted, the limitations
            challenged here would not meet the O'Brien test because the governmental interests
            advanced in support of the [practice of patronage] involve `suppressing communication.'
            " Id., at 17. For the end to be furthered by the practice involves the compulsion of
            support for the incumbent political party. Indeed, unlike the legislation tested in
            Buckley, the practice of patronage does "focus on the ideas expressed by persons or
            groups subjected to [it] . . . ." Ibid. And, contrary to O'Brien's proscription, under
            patronage "the alleged governmental interest in regulating conduct arises in some
            measure because the communication allegedly integral to the conduct is itself thought to
            be harmful." 391 U. S., at 382.</p>
         <p>[18] It does not appear that efficiency and effective government were the concerns of
            elected officials in this case. Employees originally dismissed were reinstated after
            obtaining sponsorship letters, a practice hardly promotive of efficiency if the
            employee's work had been less than par or if the employee had previously behaved in an
            insubordinate manner. App. 14. Complaints by one supervisor that too many people were
            being discharged too fast, without adequately trained replacements, were met with the
            response that the number of dismissals was to be maintained because the job openings
            were needed for partisan appointments. Id., at 15. One Republican employee of the
            Sheriff's Office was told that his dismissal had nothing to do with the quality of his
            work, but that his position was needed for a Democratic replacement. Id., at 22.</p>
         <p>[19] In this regard, petitioners' reliance on American Communications Assn. v. Douds,
            339 U. S. 382 (1950), is misplaced. To be sure, that decision upheld a section of the
            National Labor Relations Act denying certain benefits of the Act to labor organizations
            which had not filed with the National Labor Relations Board affidavits that their
            leaders were not members of the Communist Party. The Court there deferred to a
            legislative determination that, with respect to labor relations, the Communist Party was
            unlike other parties in its use of union leadership to bring about strikes and other
            obstructions to commerce. The Court was careful to note in Douds, however, that the
            precise holding in that case would not serve as a departure point for inferences of ill
            conduct grounded merely on political association. Id., at 410. Indeed, the Court in
            Douds also carefully observed that political affiliations and beliefs "are circumstances
            ordinarily irrelevant to permissible subjects of government action." Id., at 391. </p>
         <p>Those caveats were well stated. With but three exceptions shortly after Douds, Adler v.
            Board of Education, 342 U. S. 485 (1952); Garner v. Los Angeles Board, 341 U. S. 716
            (1951); and Gerende v. Board of Supervisors, 341 U. S. 56 (1951), the Court's decisions
            have consistently rejected all inferences based merely on belief and association, and we
            do so today. See, e. g., Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U. S., at 606-608; Wieman v.
            Updegraff, 344 U. S., at 188-190.</p>
         <p>[20] Legislative restraints on political management and campaigning were also upheld in
            Letter Carriers and Mitchell because they served to protect individual belief and
            association and, thereby, the political process. The distinction between this case and
            those cases in that respect is treated infra, this page and at 368-371.</p>

         <p>[22] Partisan politics bears the imprimatur only of tradition, not the Constitution. </p>
         <p>"It may be correct that the patronage system has been followed for `almost two hundred
            years' and therefore was in existence when the Constitution was adopted. However, the
            notoriety of the practice in the administration of Andrew Jackson in 1828 implies that
            it was not prevalent theretofore; we are not aware of any discussion of the practice
            during the drafting of the Constitution or the First Amendment. In any event, if the age
            of a pernicious practice were a sufficient reason for its continued acceptance, the
            constitutional attack on racial discrimination would, of course, have been doomed to
            failure." Illinois State Employees Union v. Lewis, 473 F. 2d 561, 568 n. 14 (CA7
            1972).</p>

         <p>[24] See n. 8, supra.</p>
         <p>[25] The Court's decision earlier this term in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976), is
            not contrary. It is true that in Buckley, as here, the interest to be served was the
            democratic system, and accordingly in Buckley, the infringement of some First Amendment
            rights was held to be tolerable. In Buckley, however, unlike here, the disclosure and
            contribution limitations on campaign financing, which were upheld, were essential to
            eliminating the grave evil of improper influence in the political process. The Court
            found that those provisions "constitute the Act's primary weapons against the reality or
            appearance of improper influence stemming from the dependence of candidates on large
            campaign contributions." Id., at 58. The Court further found that "[t]he contribution
            ceilings . . . serve the basic governmental interest in safeguarding the integrity of
            the electoral process without directly impinging upon the rights of individual citizens
            and candidates to engage in political debate and discussion." Ibid. With respect to
            expenditure limitations, however, which were not upheld, the Court found: "These
            provisions place substantial and direct restrictions on the ability of candidates,
            citizens, and associations to engage in protected political expression, restrictions
            that the First Amendment cannot tolerate." Id., at 58-59. The restrictions imposed by
            patronage dismissals, limiting wholesale an individual's political beliefs, expression,
            and association, while perhaps less direct, are equally, if not more, substantial, and
            therefore also intolerable to the First Amendment. Moreover, patronage dismissals
            involve the evil of influence, whose very need for elimination justified the
            contribution and disclosure provisions in Buckley.</p>
         <p>[26] "To declare that the present supposed evils of political activity are beyond the
            power of Congress to redress would leave the nation impotent to deal with what many
            sincere men believe is a material threat to the democratic system." United Public
            Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S., at 99. "Congress may reasonably desire to limit party
            activity of federal employees so as to avoid a tendency toward a one-party system." Id.,
            at 100.</p>
         <p>[27] The judgment that the First Amendment interests in political campaigning and
            management must, in the setting of public employment, give way to the First Amendment
            interests in individual belief and association does not necessarily extend to other
            contexts. Restraining political campaigning and management in the area of public
            employment leaves it free to continue in other settings. The consequence of no such
            restraint, however, is the complete restriction of individual belief and association for
            each public employee affected.</p>
         <p>[28] Letter Carriers did observe: "Although Congress is free to strike a different
            balance than it has, if it so chooses, we think the balance it has so far struck is
            sustainable by the obviously important interests sought to be served by the limitations
            on partisan political activities now contained in the Hatch Act." 413 U. S., at 564.
            Though Congress may be free not to impose restraints on political campaigning and
            management in the public employment sector, we are not similarly free to do so where
            those practices, protected as they may be in other contexts, are found impermissibly to
            pre-empt equally, if not more, fundamental constitutional rights.</p>
         <p>[29] The timeliness of political speech is particularly important. See Carroll v.
            Princess Anne, 393 U. S. 175, 182 (1968); Wood v. Georgia, 370 U. S. 375, 391-392
            (1962). </p>
         <p>"[T]he purpose of the First Amendment includes the need . . . `to protect parties in the
            free publication of matters of public concern, to secure their right to a free
            discussion of public events and public measures, and to enable every citizen at any time
            to bring the government and any person in authority to the bar of public opinion by any
            just criticism upon their conduct in the exercise of the authority which the people have
            conferred upon them.' " Id., at 392 (quoting 2 T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 885
            (8th ed. 1927)).</p>
         <p>[1] Substantially for the reasons stated in the plurality opinion, I agree that the
            question presented here is a justiciable one. I note, however, that the ability to
            formulate judicial standards is another factor to be considered in evaluating
            justiciability. Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186 (1962). The difficulty of formulating
            standards might pose a bar to judicial review of some patronage practices not before
            us.</p>
         <p>[2] The sources primarily relied upon for the statements in text are C. Fish, The Civil
            Service and the Patronage (1905), and D. Rosenbloom, Federal Service and the
            Constitution (1971).</p>
         <p>[3] On petitioners' motion to dismiss, the District Court had before it only the
            complaint and the petitioners' conclusory motions to dismiss. Although one reasonably
            may be confident that these employees willingly accepted this employment as political
            patronage, with full knowledge that their continued employment depended on the outcome
            of the next election, this may not be entirely clear from the pleadings as viewed upon a
            motion to dismiss. The District Court made no finding of fact in this respect, and its
            brief opinion does not rely on this ground.</p>
         <p>[4] One may agree readily that different plaintiffs legitimately could assert First
            Amendment interests. These would be individuals who desired to be hired for state or
            local employment and who possessed all requisite qualifications except the "right"
            political posture or sponsorship.</p>
         <p>[5] This case involves only employees. We thus face no allegations that patronage
            practices exclude any voters or candidates from effective participation in the political
            process by impermissibly disadvantaging them. Cf. Shakman v. Democratic Organization of
            Cook County, 435 F. 2d 267 (CA7 1970). Elrod informs us that since 1955 two Democrats,
            two Republicans, and an Independent have served as Sheriff. Reply Brief for Petitioners
            11 n. 20a.</p>
         <p>[6] Some commentators have believed that patronage hiring practices promote other social
            interests as well: </p>
         <p>"Patronage is peculiarly important for minority groups, involving much more than the
            mere spoils of office. Each first appointment given a member of any underdog element is
            a boost in that element's struggle for social acceptance. It means that another barrier
            to their advance has been lifted, another shut door has swung open."</p>
         <p>S. Lubell, The Future of American Politics 76-77 (1952).</p>
         <p>[7] As this case presents only the question whether a State constitutionally may pursue
            patronage hiring practices, we do not consider whether such practices would be justified
            if pursued by the Federal Government.</p>
         <p>[8] Former Senator Paul H. Douglas (D. Ill.) said of patronage hiring practices: </p>
         <p>"In short, I am for civil service but not for having civil service dominate public
            employment 100 percent. That would give us the bureaucracy of Germany and France which I
            do not regard as ideal.</p>
         <p>.....</p>
         <p>"But I would like to have you consider just how long most liberals would be able to last
            in Congress if you stripped us of all patronage, as you desire. We who try to defend the
            interests of the people, the consumers and the taxpayers commonly face the powerful
            opposition of the special-interest groups which will spend enormous sums of money to
            defeat us. . . . If we are to survive we need some support rooted in gratitude for
            material favors which at the same time do not injure the general public." Letter to New
            Republic, July 14, 1952, p. 2.</p>
         <p>[9] The plurality might be taken to concede some promotion of the democratic process by
            patronage hiring practices but to conclude that in net effect such practices will reduce
            political debate impermissibly by affecting some employees or potential employees and
            thereby depriving society of the "unfettered judgment of each citizen on matters of
            political concern." Ante, at 372. In the past the Court has upheld congressional actions
            designed to increase the overall level of political discourse but affecting adversely
            the First Amendment interests of some individuals. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 64-68
            (1976) (disclosure requirements); CSC v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 564-566 (1973);
            Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 392-395 (1969). In Letter Carriers we
            indicated specifically that the First Amendment freedoms of federal employees could be
            limited in an effort to further the functioning of the democratic process. I do not
            believe that local legislative judgments as to what will further the democratic process
            in light of local conditions should receive less weight than these congressional
            judgments. Surely that should be the case until we have a record, if one could be
            created, showing the fears of the plurality to be justified.</p>
         <p>[10] The judgment today is limited to nonpolicymaking positions. Ante, at 367-368. A
            "policymaking" exception, however, will not allow substantial advancement of the state
            interests undercut by the Court's holding, as it is doubtful that any significant number
            of employees can be identified as policymakers in a sheriff's office. States have chosen
            to provide for the election of many local officials who have little or no genuine
            policymaking functions, see supra, at 383-384, and the subordinates of such officials
            are even less likely to have such functions. It thus is predictable that the holding
            today will terminate almost completely the contributions of patronage hiring practices
            to the democratic process. The probability of this result is increased to the extent
            that the needs of efficiency in local government require that policymaking positions be
            included in a merit-oriented, nonpolitical civil service.</p>
         <p>[11] It appears that before the adoption of the Australian ballot, one's access to or
            retention of a government job sometimes could depend on voting "correctly." D.
            Rosenbloom, supra, n. 2, at 61. Today this ultimate core of political expression is
            beyond the reach of any coercive effects of the patronage system.</p>
         <p>[12] In concluding that the Constitution does not require the invalidation of state and
            local patronage systems, I wish to make clear that approval of any particular type of
            system or of the practice in any particular State, city, or community is not implied. I
            believe that the prevailing practice is to establish a broad base of merit-oriented
            civil service, but to leave some room for the operation of traditional patronage. I must
            say that the "mix" in Cook County (where only about half of the employees in the
            Sheriff's Office are within the merit system) seems disproportionate. On the other hand,
            there are smaller communities&#x97;e. g., where nonpartisan, council-manager forms of
            government exist&#x97;in which the merit system embraces the vast majority of public
            employees. Political scientists and students of government differ, and their views also
            have varied from time to time, as to the best means of structuring state and local
            government employment in the public interest. Nor is the answer necessarily the same for
            every community without regard to its size, form of government, or other local
            conditions. My conviction, as indicated in the opinion above, is that we should not
            foreclose local options in the name of a constitutional right perceived to be applicable
            for the first time after nearly two centuries.</p>
