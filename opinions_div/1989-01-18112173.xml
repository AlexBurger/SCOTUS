         <h2>I</h2>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p/>
         <h2>Background</h2>
         <p>For almost a century, the Federal Government employed in criminal cases a system of
            indeterminate sentencing. Statutes specified the penalties for crimes but nearly always
            gave the sentencing judge wide discretion to decide whether the offender should be
            incarcerated and for how long, whether restraint, such as probation, should be imposed
            instead of imprisonment or fine. This indeterminate-sentencing system was supplemented
            by the utilization of parole, by which an offender was returned to society under the
            "guidance and control" of a parole officer. See Zerbst v. Kidwell, 304 U. S. 359, 363
            (1938).</p>
         <p>Both indeterminate sentencing and parole were based on concepts of the offender's
            possible, indeed probable, rehabilitation, a view that it was realistic to attempt to
            rehabilitate the inmate and thereby to minimize the risk that he would resume criminal
            activity upon his return to society. It obviously required the judge and the parole
            officer to make their respective sentencing and release decisions upon their own
            assessments of the offender's amenability to rehabilitation. As a result, the court and
            the officer were in positions to exercise, and usually did exercise, very broad
            discretion. See Kadish, The Advocate and the Expert &#x97; Counsel in the
            Peno-Correctional Process, 45 Minn. L. Rev. 803, 812-813 (1961). <span
               class="star-pagination">*364</span> This led almost inevitably to the conclusion on
            the part of a reviewing court that the sentencing judge "sees more and senses more" than
            the appellate court; thus, the judge enjoyed the "superiority of his nether position,"
            for that court's determination as to what sentence was appropriate met with virtually
            unconditional deference on appeal. See Rosenberg, Judicial Discretion of the Trial
            Court, Viewed From Above, 22 Syracuse L. Rev. 635, 663 (1971). See Dorszynski v. United
            States, 418 U. S. 424, 431 (1974). The decision whether to parole was also "predictive
            and discretionary." Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, 480 (1972). The correction
            official possessed almost absolute discretion over the parole decision. See, e. g.,
            Brest v. Ciccone, 371 F. 2d 981, 982-983 (CA8 1967); Rifai v. United States Parole
            Comm'n, 586 F. 2d 695 (CA9 1978).</p>
         <p>Historically, federal sentencing &#x97; the function of determining the scope and extent
            of punishment &#x97; never has been thought to be assigned by the Constitution to the
            exclusive jurisdiction of any one of the three Branches of Government. Congress, of
            course, has the power to fix the sentence for a federal crime, United States v.

            </span> (1820), and the scope of judicial discretion with respect to a sentence is
            subject to congressional control. Ex parte United States, 242 U. S. 27 (1916). Congress
            early abandoned fixed-sentence rigidity, however, and put in place a system of ranges
            within which the sentencer could choose the precise punishment. See United States v.
            Grayson, 438 U. S. 41, 45-46 (1978). Congress delegated almost unfettered discretion to
            the sentencing judge to determine what the sentence should be within the customarily
            wide range so selected. This broad discretion was further enhanced by the power later
            granted the judge to suspend the sentence and by the resulting growth of an elaborate
            probation system. Also, with the advent of parole, Congress moved toward a "three-way
            sharing" of sentencing responsibility by granting corrections personnel in the Executive
            Branch the discretion <span class="star-pagination">*365</span> to release a prisoner
            before the expiration of the sentence imposed by the judge. Thus, under the
            indeterminate-sentence system, Congress defined the maximum, the judge imposed a
            sentence within the statutory range (which he usually could replace with probation), and
            the Executive Branch's parole official eventually determined the actual duration of
            imprisonment. See Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 248 (1949). See also Geraghty v.
            United States Parole Comm'n, 719 F. 2d 1199, 1211 (CA3 1983), cert. denied, 465 U. S.
            1103 (1984); United States v. Addonizio, 442 U. S. 178, 190 (1979); United States v.
            Brown, 381 U. S. 437, 443 (1965) ("[I]f a given policy can be implemented only by a
            combination of legislative enactment, judicial application, and executive
            implementation, no man or group of men will be able to impose its unchecked will").</p>
         <p>Serious disparities in sentences, however, were common. Rehabilitation as a sound
            penological theory came to be questioned and, in any event, was regarded by some as an
            unattainable goal for most cases. See N. Morris, The Future of Imprisonment 24-43
            (1974); F. Allen, The Decline of the Rehabilitative Ideal (1981). In 1958, Congress
            authorized the creation of judicial sentencing institutes and joint councils, see 28 U.
            S. C. § 334, to formulate standards and criteria for sentencing. In 1973, the United
            States Parole Board adopted guidelines that established a "customary range" of
            confinement. See United States Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388, 391 (1980).
            Congress in 1976 endorsed this initiative through the Parole Commission and
            Reorganization Act, 18 U. S. C. §§ 4201-4218, an attempt to envision for the Parole
            Commission a role, at least in part, "to moderate the disparities in the sentencing
            practices of individual judges." United States v. Addonizio, 442 U. S., at 189. That
            Act, however, did not disturb the division of sentencing responsibility among the three
            Branches. The judge continued to exercise discretion and to set the sentence within the
            statutory range fixed by Congress, while the prisoner's <span class="star-pagination"
               >*366</span> actual release date generally was set by the Parole Commission.</p>
         <p>This proved to be no more than a way station. Fundamental and widespread dissatisfaction
            with the uncertainties and the disparities continued to be expressed. Congress had
            wrestled with the problem for more than a decade when, in 1984, it enacted the sweeping
            reforms that are at issue here.</p>
         <p>Helpful in our consideration and analysis of the statute is the Senate Report on the
            1984 legislation, S. Rep. No. 98-225 (1983) (Report).<span class="sup">[3]</span> The
            Report referred to the "outmoded rehabilitation model" for federal criminal sentencing,
            and recognized that the efforts of the criminal justice system to achieve rehabilitation
            of offenders had failed. Id., at 38. It observed that the indeterminate-sentencing
            system had two "unjustifi[ed]" and "shameful" consequences. Id., at 38, 65. The first
            was the great variation among sentences imposed by different judges upon similarly
            situated offenders. The second was the uncertainty as to the time the offender would
            spend in prison. Each was a serious impediment to an evenhanded and effective operation
            of the criminal justice system. The Report went on to note that parole was an inadequate
            device for overcoming these undesirable consequences. This was due to the division of
            authority between the sentencing judge and the parole officer who often worked at cross
            purposes; to the fact that the Parole Commission's own guidelines did not take into
            account factors Congress regarded as important in sentencing, such as the sophistication
            of the offender and the role the offender played in an offense committed with others,
            id., at 48; and to the fact that the Parole Commission had only limited power to adjust
            a sentence imposed by the court. Id., at 47.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*367</span> Before settling on a mandatory-guideline
            system, Congress considered other competing proposals for sentencing reform. It rejected
            strict determinate sentencing because it concluded that a guideline system would be
            successful in reducing sentence disparities while retaining the flexibility needed to
            adjust for unanticipated factors arising in a particular case. Id., at 78-79, 62. The
            Judiciary Committee rejected a proposal that would have made the sentencing guidelines
            only advisory. Id., at 79.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B</h2>
         <p/>
         <h2>The Act</h2>
         <p>The Act, as adopted, revises the old sentencing process in several ways:</p>
         <p>1. It rejects imprisonment as a means of promoting rehabilitation, 28 U. S. C. § 994(k),
            and it states that punishment should serve retributive, educational, deterrent, and
            incapacitative goals, 18 U. S. C. § 3553(a)(2).</p>
         <p>2. It consolidates the power that had been exercised by the sentencing judge and the
            Parole Commission to decide what punishment an offender should suffer. This is done by
            creating the United States Sentencing Commission, directing that Commission to devise
            guidelines to be used for sentencing, and prospectively abolishing the Parole
            Commission. 28 U. S. C. §§ 991, 994, and 995(a)(1).</p>
         <p>3. It makes all sentences basically determinate. A prisoner is to be released at the
            completion of his sentence reduced only by any credit earned by good behavior while in
            custody. 18 U. S. C. §§ 3624(a) and (b).</p>
         <p>4. It makes the Sentencing Commission's guidelines binding on the courts, although it
            preserves for the judge the discretion to depart from the guideline applicable to a
            particular case if the judge finds an aggravating or mitigating factor present that the
            Commission did not adequately consider when formulating guidelines. §§ 3553(a) and (b).
            The Act also requires the court to state its reasons for the sentence <span
               class="star-pagination">*368</span> imposed and to give "the specific reason" for
            imposing a sentence different from that described in the guideline. § 3553(c).</p>
         <p>5. It authorizes limited appellate review of the sentence. It permits a defendant to
            appeal a sentence that is above the defined range, and it permits the Government to
            appeal a sentence that is below that range. It also permits either side to appeal an
            incorrect application of the guideline. §§ 3742(a) and (b).</p>
         <p>Thus, guidelines were meant to establish a range of determinate sentences for categories
            of offenses and defendants according to various specified factors, "among others." 28 U.
            S. C. §§ 994(b), (c), and (d). The maximum of the range ordinarily may not exceed the
            minimum by more than the greater of 25% or six months, and each sentence is to be within
            the limit provided by existing law. §§ 994(a) and (b)(2).</p>

         <h2>The Sentencing Commission</h2>
         <p>The Commission is established "as an independent commission in the judicial branch of
            the United States." § 991(a). It has seven voting members (one of whom is the Chairman)
            appointed by the President "by and with the advice and consent of the Senate." "At least
            three of the members shall be Federal judges selected after considering a list of six
            judges recommended to the President by the Judicial Conference of the United States."
            Ibid. No more than four members of the Commission shall be members of the same political
            party. The Attorney General, or his designee, is an ex officio nonvoting member. The
            Chairman and other members of the Commission are subject to removal by the President
            "only for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office or for other good cause shown." Ibid.
            Except for initial staggering of terms, <span class="star-pagination">*369</span> a
            voting member serves for six years and may not serve more than two full terms. §§ 992(a)

         <h2>The Responsibilities of the Commission</h2>
         <p>In addition to the duty the Commission has to promulgate determinative-sentence
            guidelines, it is under an obligation periodically to "review and revise" the
            guidelines. § 994(o). It is to "consult with authorities on, and individual and
            institutional representatives of, various aspects of the Federal criminal justice
            system." Ibid. It must report to Congress "any amendments of the guidelines." § 994(p).
            It is to make recommendations to Congress whether the grades or maximum penalties should
            be modified. § 994(r). It must submit to Congress at least annually an analysis of the
            operation of the guidelines. § 994(w). It is to issue "general policy statements"
            regarding their application. § 994(a)(2). And it has the power to "establish general
            policies . . . as are necessary to carry out the purposes" of the legislation, §
            995(a)(1); to "monitor the performance of probation officers" with respect to the
            guidelines, § 995(a)(9); to "devise and conduct periodic training programs of
            instruction in sentencing techniques for judicial and probation personnel" and others, §
            995(a)(18); and to "perform such other functions as are required to permit Federal
            courts to meet their responsibilities" as to sentencing, § 995(a)(22).</p>
         <p>We note, in passing, that the monitoring function is not without its burden. Every year,
            with respect to each of more than 40,000 sentences, the federal courts must forward, and
            the Commission must review, the presentence report, <span class="star-pagination"
               >*370</span> the guideline worksheets, the tribunal's sentencing statement, and any
            written plea agreement.</p>

         <h2>II</h2>
         <p/>
         <h2>This Litigation</h2>
         <p>On December 10, 1987, John M. Mistretta (petitioner) and another were indicted in the
            United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri on three counts
            centering in a cocaine sale. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 87-1904, p. 16a.
            Mistretta moved to have the promulgated Guidelines ruled unconstitutional on the grounds
            that the Sentencing Commission was constituted in violation of the established doctrine
            of separation of powers, and that Congress delegated excessive authority to the
            Commission to structure the Guidelines. As has been noted, the District Court was not
            persuaded by these contentions.<span class="sup">[5]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The District Court rejected petitioner's delegation argument on the ground that, despite
            the language of the statute, the Sentencing Commission "should be judicially
            characterized as having Executive Branch status," 682 F. Supp., at 1035, and that the
            Guidelines are similar to substantive rules promulgated by other agencies. Id., at
            1034-1035. The court also rejected petitioner's claim that the Act is unconstitutional
            because it requires Article III federal judges to serve on the Commission. Id., at 1035.
            The court stated, however, that its opinion "does not imply that I have no serious
            doubts about some parts of the Sentencing Guidelines and the legality of their
            anticipated operation." Ibid.</p>
         <p>Petitioner had pleaded guilty to the first count of his indictment (conspiracy and
            agreement to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U. S. C. §§ 846 and 841(b)(1)(B)).
            The Government thereupon moved to dismiss the remaining counts. <span
               class="star-pagination">*371</span> That motion was granted. App. to Pet. for Cert.
            in No. 87-1904, p. 33a. Petitioner was sentenced under the Guidelines to 18 months'
            imprisonment, to be followed by a 3-year term of supervised release. Id., at 30a, 35a,
            37a. The court also imposed a $1,000 fine and a $50 special assessment. Id., at 31a,
            40a.</p>
         <p>Petitioner filed a notice of appeal to the Eighth Circuit, but both petitioner and the
            United States, pursuant to this Court's Rule 18, petitioned for certiorari before
            judgment. Because of the "imperative public importance" of the issue, as prescribed by
            the Rule, and because of the disarray among the Federal District Courts,<span
               class="sup">[6]</span> we granted those petitions. 486 U. S. 1054 (1988).</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p/>
         <h2>Delegation of Power</h2>
         <p>Petitioner argues that in delegating the power to promulgate sentencing guidelines for
            every federal criminal offense to an independent Sentencing Commission, Congress has
            granted the Commission excessive legislative discretion in violation of the
            constitutionally based nondelegation doctrine. We do not agree.</p>
         <p>The nondelegation doctrine is rooted in the principle of separation of powers that
            underlies our tripartite system of Government. The Constitution provides that "[a]ll
            legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States,"
            U. S. Const., Art. I, § 1, and we long have insisted that "the integrity and maintenance
            of <span class="star-pagination">*372</span> the system of government ordained by the
            Constitution" mandate that Congress generally cannot delegate its legislative power to
            another Branch. Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 692 (1892). We also have recognized,
            however, that the separation-of-powers principle, and the nondelegation doctrine in
            particular, do not prevent Congress from obtaining the assistance of its coordinate
            Branches. In a passage now enshrined in our jurisprudence, Chief Justice Taft, writing
            for the Court, explained our approach to such cooperative ventures: "In determining what
            [Congress] may do in seeking assistance from another branch, the extent and character of
            that assistance must be fixed according to common sense and the inherent necessities of
            the government co-ordination." J. W. Hampton, Jr., &amp;amp; Co. v. United States, 276
            U. S. 394, 406 (1928). So long as Congress "shall lay down by legislative act an
            intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [exercise the delegated
            authority] is directed to conform, such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation
            of legislative power." Id., at 409.</p>
         <p>Applying this "intelligible principle" test to congressional delegations, our
            jurisprudence has been driven by a practical understanding that in our increasingly
            complex society, replete with ever changing and more technical problems, Congress simply
            cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives.
            See Opp Cotton Mills, Inc. v. Administrator, Wage and Hour Div. of Dept. of Labor, 312
            U. S. 126, 145 (1941) ("In an increasingly complex society Congress obviously could not
            perform its functions if it were obliged to find all the facts subsidiary to the basic
            conclusions which support the defined legislative policy"); see also United States v.
            Robel, 389 U. S. 258, 274 (1967) (opinion concurring in result). "The Constitution has
            never been regarded as denying to the Congress the necessary resources of flexibility
            and practicality, which will enable it to perform its function." Panama Refining Co. v.
            Ryan, 293 U. S. 388, 421 (1935). Accordingly, this Court has deemed it "constitutionally
            sufficient if Congress clearly <span class="star-pagination">*373</span> delineates the
            general policy, the public agency which is to apply it, and the boundaries of this
            delegated authority." American Power &amp;amp; Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U. S. 90, 105
            (1946).</p>
         <p>Until 1935, this Court never struck down a challenged statute on delegation grounds. See

            Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U. S. 495, and Panama Refining Co. v.
            Ryan, supra, we have upheld, again without deviation, Congress' ability to delegate
            power under broad standards.<span class="sup">[7]</span> See, e. g., Lichter v. United
            States, 334 U. S. 742, 785-786 (1948) (upholding delegation of authority to determine
            excessive profits); American Power &amp;amp; Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U. S., at 105
            (upholding delegation of authority to Securities and Exchange Commission to prevent
            unfair or inequitable distribution of voting power among security holders); Yakus v.
            United States, 321 U. S. 414, 426 (1944) (upholding delegation to Price Administrator to
            fix commodity prices that would be fair and equitable, and would effectuate purposes of
            Emergency Price Control Act of 1942); FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U. S. 591, 600
            (1944) (upholding delegation to Federal Power Commission to determine <span
               class="star-pagination">*374</span> just and reasonable rates); National Broadcasting
            Co. v. United States, 319 U. S. 190, 225-226 (1943) (upholding delegation to Federal
            Communications Commission to regulate broadcast licensing "as public interest,
            convenience, or necessity" require).</p>
         <p>In light of our approval of these broad delegations, we harbor no doubt that Congress'
            delegation of authority to the Sentencing Commission is sufficiently specific and
            detailed to meet constitutional requirements. Congress charged the Commission with three
            goals: to "assure the meeting of the purposes of sentencing as set forth" in the Act; to
            "provide certainty and fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing, avoiding
            unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records . . . while
            maintaining sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences," where
            appropriate; and to "reflect, to the extent practicable, advancement in knowledge of
            human behavior as it relates to the criminal justice process." 28 U. S. C. § 991(b)(1).
            Congress further specified four "purposes" of sentencing that the Commission must pursue
            in carrying out its mandate: "to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote
            respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense"; "to afford
            adequate deterrence to criminal conduct"; "to protect the public from further crimes of
            the defendant"; and "to provide the defendant with needed . . . correctional treatment."
            18 U. S. C. § 3553(a)(2).</p>
         <p>In addition, Congress prescribed the specific tool &#x97; the guidelines system &#x97;
            for the Commission to use in regulating sentencing. More particularly, Congress directed
            the Commission to develop a system of "sentencing ranges" applicable "for each category
            of offense involving each category of defendant." 28 U. S. C. § 994(b).<span class="sup"
               >[8]</span> Congress instructed the <span class="star-pagination">*375</span>
            Commission that these sentencing ranges must be consistent with pertinent provisions of
            Title 18 of the United States Code and could not include sentences in excess of the
            statutory maxima. Congress also required that for sentences of imprisonment, "the
            maximum of the range established for such a term shall not exceed the minimum of that
            range by more than the greater of 25 percent or 6 months, except that, if the minimum
            term of the range is 30 years or more, the maximum may be life imprisonment." §
            994(b)(2). Moreover, Congress directed the Commission to use current average sentences
            "as a starting point" for its structuring of the sentencing ranges. § 994(m).</p>
         <p>To guide the Commission in its formulation of offense categories, Congress directed it
            to consider seven factors: the grade of the offense; the aggravating and mitigating
            circumstances of the crime; the nature and degree of the harm caused by the crime; the
            community view of the gravity of the offense; the public concern generated by the crime;
            the deterrent effect that a particular sentence may have on others; and the current
            incidence of the offense. §§ 994(c)(1)(7).<span class="sup">[9]</span> Congress set
            forth 11 factors for the Commission to <span class="star-pagination">*376</span>
            consider in establishing categories of defendants. These include the offender's age,
            education, vocational skills, mental and emotional condition, physical condition
            (including drug dependence), previous employment record, family ties and
            responsibilities, community ties, role in the offense, criminal history, and degree of
            dependence upon crime for a livelihood. § 994(d)(1)-(11).<span class="sup">[10]</span>
            Congress also prohibited the Commission from considering the "race, sex, national
            origin, creed, and socioeconomic status of offenders," § 994(d), and instructed that the
            guidelines should reflect the "general inappropriateness" of considering certain other
            factors, such as current unemployment, that might serve as proxies for forbidden
            factors, § 994(e).</p>
         <p>In addition to these overarching constraints, Congress provided even more detailed
            guidance to the Commission about categories of offenses and offender characteristics.
            Congress directed that guidelines require a term of confinement at or near the statutory
            maximum for certain crimes of violence and for drug offenses, particularly when
            committed by recidivists. § 994(h). Congress further directed that the Commission assure
            a substantial term of imprisonment for an offense constituting a third felony
            conviction, for a career <span class="star-pagination">*377</span> felon, for one
            convicted of a managerial role in a racketeering enterprise, for a crime of violence by
            an offender on release from a prior felony conviction, and for an offense involving a
            substantial quantity of narcotics. § 994(i). Congress also instructed "that the
            guidelines reflect . . . the general appropriateness of imposing a term of imprisonment"
            for a crime of violence that resulted in serious bodily injury. On the other hand,
            Congress directed that guidelines reflect the general inappropriateness of imposing a
            sentence of imprisonment "in cases in which the defendant is a first offender who has
            not been convicted of a crime of violence or an otherwise serious offense." § 994(j).
            Congress also enumerated various aggravating and mitigating circumstances, such as,
            respectively, multiple offenses or substantial assistance to the Government, to be
            reflected in the guidelines. §§ 994(l) and (n). In other words, although Congress
            granted the Commission substantial discretion in formulating guidelines, in actuality it
            legislated a full hierarchy of punishment &#x97; from near maximum imprisonment, to
            substantial imprisonment, to some imprisonment, to alternatives &#x97; and stipulated
            the most important offense and offender characteristics to place defendants within these
            categories.</p>
         <p>We cannot dispute petitioner's contention that the Commission enjoys significant
            discretion in formulating guidelines. The Commission does have discretionary authority
            to determine the relative severity of federal crimes and to assess the relative weight
            of the offender characteristics that Congress listed for the Commission to consider. See
            §§ 994(c) and (d) (Commission instructed to consider enumerated factors as it deems them
            to be relevant). The Commission also has significant discretion to determine which
            crimes have been punished too leniently, and which too severely. § 994(m). Congress has
            called upon the Commission to exercise its judgment about which types of crimes and
            which <span class="star-pagination">*378</span> types of criminals are to be considered
            similar for the purposes of sentencing.<span class="sup">[11]</span>
         </p>
         <p>But our cases do not at all suggest that delegations of this type may not carry with
            them the need to exercise judgment on matters of policy. In Yakus v. United States, 321
            U. S. 414 (1944), the Court upheld a delegation to the Price Administrator to fix
            commodity prices that "in his judgment will be generally fair and equitable and will
            effectuate the purposes of this Act" to stabilize prices and avert speculation. See id.,
            at 420. In National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U. S. 190 (1943), we upheld a
            delegation to the Federal Communications Commission granting it the authority to
            promulgate regulations in accordance with its view of the "public interest." In Yakus,
            the Court laid down the applicable principle:</p> "It is no objection that the
         determination of facts and the inferences to be drawn from them in the light of the
         statutory standards and declaration of policy call for the exercise <span
            class="star-pagination">*379</span> of judgment, and for the formulation of subsidiary
         administrative policy within the prescribed statutory framework. . . . ..... ". . . Only if
         we could say that there is an absence of standards for the guidance of the Administrator's
         action, so that it would be impossible in a proper proceeding to ascertain whether the will
         of Congress has been obeyed, would we be justified in overriding its choice of means for
         effecting its declared purpose . . . ." 321 U. S., at 425-426. <p>Congress has met that
            standard here. The Act sets forth more than merely an "intelligible principle" or
            minimal standards. One court has aptly put it: "The statute outlines the policies which
            prompted establishment of the Commission, explains what the Commission should do and how
            it should do it, and sets out specific directives to govern particular situations."

            for which delegation to an expert body is especially appropriate. Although Congress has
            delegated significant discretion to the Commission to draw judgments from its analysis
            of existing sentencing practice and alternative sentencing models, "Congress is not
            confined to that method of executing its policy which involves the least possible
            delegation of discretion to administrative officers." Yakus v. United States, 321 U. S.,
            at 425-426. We have no doubt that in the hands of the Commission "the criteria which
            Congress has supplied are wholly adequate for carrying out the general policy and
            purpose" of the Act. Sunshine Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U. S. 381, 398 (1940).</p>

         <h2>Separation of Powers</h2>
         <p>Having determined that Congress has set forth sufficient standards for the exercise of
            the Commission's delegated authority, we turn to Mistretta's claim that the Act violates
            the constitutional principle of separation of powers.</p>
         <p>This Court consistently has given voice to, and has reaffirmed, the central judgment of
            the Framers of the Constitution that, within our political scheme, the separation of
            governmental powers into three coordinate Branches is essential to the preservation of
            liberty. See, e. g., Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654, 685-696 (1988); Bowsher v. Synar,
            478 U. S., at 725. Madison, in writing about the principle of separated powers, said:
            "No political truth is certainly of greater intrinsic value or is stamped with the
            authority of more enlightened patrons of liberty." The <ref type="intent" num="47">Federalist</ref> No. 47, p. 324 (J.
            Cooke ed. 1961).</p>
         <p>In applying the principle of separated powers in our jurisprudence, we have sought to
            give life to Madison's view of the appropriate relationship among the three coequal
            Branches. Accordingly, we have recognized, as Madison admonished at the founding, that
            while our Constitution mandates that "each of the three general departments of
            government [must remain] entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or
            indirect, of either of the others," Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U. S. 602,
            629 (1935), the Framers did not require &#x97; and indeed rejected &#x97; the notion
            that the three Branches must be entirely separate and distinct. See, e. g., Nixon v.
            Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 443 (1977) (rejecting as archaic
            complete division of authority among the three Branches); United States v. Nixon, 418 U.
            S. 683 (1974) (affirming Madison's flexible approach to separation of powers). Madison,
            defending the Constitution against charges that it established insufficiently separate
            Branches, addressed the point directly. Separation of powers, he wrote, "d[oes] not mean
            that these [three] <span class="star-pagination">*381</span> departments ought to have
            no partial agency in, or no controul over the acts of each other," but rather "that
            where the whole power of one department is exercised by the same hands which possess the
            whole power of another department, the fundamental principles of a free constitution,
            are subverted." The <ref type="intent" num="47">Federalist</ref> No. 47, pp. 325-326 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (emphasis in
            original). See Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S., at 442, n. 5.
            Madison recognized that our constitutional system imposes upon the Branches a degree of
            overlapping responsibility, a duty of interdependence as well as independence the
            absence of which "would preclude the establishment of a Nation capable of governing
            itself effectively." Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 121 (1976). In a passage now
            commonplace in our cases, Justice Jackson summarized the pragmatic, flexible view of
            differentiated governmental power to which we are heir:</p> "While the Constitution
         diffuses power the better to secure liberty, it also contemplates that practice will
         integrate the dispersed powers into a workable government. It enjoins upon its branches
         separateness but interdependence, autonomy but reciprocity." Youngstown Sheet &amp;amp;
         Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 635 (1952) (concurring opinion). <p>In adopting this
            flexible understanding of separation of powers, we simply have recognized Madison's
            teaching that the greatest security against tyranny &#x97; the accumulation of excessive
            authority in a single Branch &#x97; lies not in a hermetic division among the Branches,
            but in a carefully crafted system of checked and balanced power within each Branch.
            "[T]he greatest security," wrote Madison, "against a gradual concentration of the
            several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each
            department, the necessary constitutional means, and personal motives, to resist
            encroachments of the others." The <ref type="intent" num="51">Federalist</ref> No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).
            Accordingly, as we have noted <span class="star-pagination">*382</span> many times, the
            Framers "built into the tripartite Federal Government . . . a self-executing safeguard
            against the encroachment or aggrandizement of one branch at the expense of the other."
            Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 122. See also INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 951
            (1983).</p>
         <p>It is this concern of encroachment and aggrandizement that has animated our
            separation-of-powers jurisprudence and aroused our vigilance against the "hydraulic
            pressure inherent within each of the separate Branches to exceed the outer limits of its
            power." Ibid. Accordingly, we have not hesitated to strike down provisions of law that
            either accrete to a single Branch powers more appropriately diffused among separate
            Branches or that undermine the authority and independence of one or another coordinate
            Branch. For example, just as the Framers recognized the particular danger of the
            Legislative Branch's accreting to itself judicial or executive power,<span class="sup"
               >[12]</span> so too have we invalidated attempts by Congress to exercise the
            responsibilities of other Branches or to reassign powers vested by the Constitution in
            either the Judicial Branch or the Executive Branch. Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714
            (1986) (Congress may not exercise removal power over officer performing executive
            functions); INS v. Chadha, supra (Congress may not control execution of laws except
            through Art. I procedures); Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line
            Co., 458 U. S. 50 (1982) (Congress may not confer Art. III power on Art. I judge). By
            the same token, we have upheld statutory provisions that to some degree commingle the
            functions of the Branches, but that pose no danger of either aggrandizement or
            encroachment. Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988) (upholding judicial appointment of
            independent counsel); Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833 (1986)
            (upholding <span class="star-pagination">*383</span> agency's assumption of jurisdiction
            over state-law counterclaims).</p>
         <p>In Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, supra, upholding, against a
            separation-of-powers challenge, legislation providing for the General Services
            Administration to control Presidential papers after resignation, we described our
            separation-of-powers inquiry as focusing "on the extent to which [a provision of law]
            prevents the Executive Branch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned
            functions." 433 U. S., at 443 (citing United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S., at
               711-712.<span class="sup">[13]</span> In cases specifically involving the Judicial
            Branch, we have expressed our vigilance against two dangers: first, that the Judicial
            Branch neither be assigned nor allowed "tasks that are more properly accomplished by
            [other] branches," Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S., at 680-681, and, second, that no
            provision of law "impermissibly threatens the institutional integrity of the Judicial
            Branch." Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U. S., at 851.</p>
         <p>Mistretta argues that the Act suffers from each of these constitutional infirmities. He
            argues that Congress, in constituting the Commission as it did, effected an
            unconstitutional accumulation of power within the Judicial Branch while at the same time
            undermining the Judiciary's independence and integrity. Specifically, petitioner claims
            that in delegating to an independent agency within the Judicial Branch the power to
            promulgate sentencing guidelines, Congress unconstitutionally has required the Branch,
            and individual Article III judges, to exercise not only their judicial authority, but
            legislative authority &#x97; the making of sentencing policy &#x97; as well. Such
            rulemaking authority, petitioner contends, may be exercised by Congress, or delegated by
            Congress to the <span class="star-pagination">*384</span> Executive, but may not be
            delegated to or exercised by the Judiciary. Brief for Petitioner 21.</p>
         <p>At the same time, petitioner asserts, Congress unconstitutionally eroded the integrity
            and independence of the Judiciary by requiring Article III judges to sit on the
            Commission, by requiring that those judges share their rulemaking authority with
            nonjudges, and by subjecting the Commission's members to appointment and removal by the
            President. According to petitioner, Congress, consistent with the separation of powers,
            may not upset the balance among the Branches by co-opting federal judges into the
            quintessentially political work of establishing sentencing guidelines, by subjecting
            those judges to the political whims of the Chief Executive, and by forcing judges to
            share their power with nonjudges. Id., at 15-35.</p>
         <p>"When this Court is asked to invalidate a statutory provision that has been approved by
            both Houses of the Congress and signed by the President, particularly an Act of Congress
            that confronts a deeply vexing national problem, it should only do so for the most
            compelling constitutional reasons." Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S., at 736 (opinion
            concurring in judgment). Although the unique composition and responsibilities of the
            Sentencing Commission give rise to serious concerns about a disruption of the
            appropriate balance of governmental power among the coordinate Branches, we conclude,
            upon close inspection, that petitioner's fears for the fundamental structural
            protections of the Constitution prove, at least in this case, to be "more smoke than
            fire," and do not compel us to invalidate Congress' considered scheme for resolving the
            seemingly intractable dilemma of excessive disparity in criminal sentencing.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p/>
         <h2>Location of the Commission</h2>
         <p>The Sentencing Commission unquestionably is a peculiar institution within the framework
            of our Government. Although placed by the Act in the Judicial Branch, it is not a <span
               class="star-pagination">*385</span> court and does not exercise judicial power.
            Rather, the Commission is an "independent" body comprised of seven voting members
            including at least three federal judges, entrusted by Congress with the primary task of
            promulgating sentencing guidelines. 28 U. S. C. § 991(a). Our constitutional principles
            of separated powers are not violated, however, by mere anomaly or innovation. Setting to
            one side, for the moment, the question whether the composition of the Sentencing
            Commission violates the separation of powers, we observe that Congress' decision to
            create an independent rulemaking body to promulgate sentencing guidelines and to locate
            that body within the Judicial Branch is not unconstitutional unless Congress has vested
            in the Commission powers that are more appropriately performed by the other Branches or
            that undermine the integrity of the Judiciary.</p>
         <p>According to express provision of Article III, the judicial power of the United States
            is limited to "Cases" and "Controversies." See Muskrat v. United States, 219 U. S. 346,
            356 (1911). In implementing this limited grant of power, we have refused to issue
            advisory opinions or to resolve disputes that are not justiciable. See, e. g., Flast v.
            Cohen, 392 U. S. 83 (1968); United States v. Ferreira, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/rMc/united-states-v-ferreira/">
                  <span class="volume">13</span>
                  <span class="reporter">How.</span>
                  <span class="page">40</span>
               </a>
            </span> (1852). These doctrines help to ensure the independence of the Judicial Branch
            by precluding debilitating entanglements between the Judiciary and the two political
            Branches, and prevent the Judiciary from encroaching into areas reserved for the other
            Branches by extending judicial power to matters beyond those disputes "traditionally
            thought to be capable of resolution through the judicial process." Flast v. Cohen, 392
            U. S., at 97; see also United States Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S., at 396. As a
            general principle, we stated as recently as last Term that " `executive or
            administrative duties of a nonjudicial nature may not be imposed on judges holding
            office under Art. III of the Constitution.' " Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S., at 677,
            quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 123, citing in turn United States v. Ferreira,
            supra, and Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792).</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*386</span> Nonetheless, we have recognized significant
            exceptions to this general rule and have approved the assumption of some nonadjudicatory
            activities by the Judicial Branch. In keeping with Justice Jackson's Youngstown
            admonition that the separation of powers contemplates the integration of dispersed
            powers into a workable Government, we have recognized the constitutionality of a
            "twilight area" in which the activities of the separate Branches merge. In his dissent
            in Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52 (1926), Justice Brandeis explained that the
            separation of powers "left to each [Branch] power to exercise, in some respects,
            functions in their nature executive, legislative and judicial." Id., at 291.</p>
         <p>That judicial rulemaking, at least with respect to some subjects, falls within this
            twilight area is no longer an issue for dispute. None of our cases indicate that
            rulemaking per se is a function that may not be performed by an entity within the
            Judicial Branch, either because rulemaking is inherently nonjudicial or because it is a
            function exclusively committed to the Executive Branch.<span class="sup">[14]</span> On
            the contrary, we specifically <span class="star-pagination">*387</span> have held that
            Congress, in some circumstances, may confer rulemaking authority on the Judicial Branch.
            In Sibbach v. Wilson &amp;amp; Co., 312 U. S. 1 (1941), we upheld a challenge to certain
            rules promulgated under the Rules Enabling Act of 1934, which conferred upon the
            Judiciary the power to promulgate federal rules of civil procedure. See 28 U. S. C. §
            2072. We observed: "Congress has undoubted power to regulate the practice and procedure
            of federal courts, and may exercise that power by delegating to this or other federal
            courts authority to make rules not inconsistent with the statutes or constitution of the
            United States." 312 U. S., at 9-10 (footnote omitted). This passage in Sibbach simply
            echoed what had been our view since Wayman v. Southard, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/rpk/wayman-v-southard/">

               </a>
            </span>, 43 (1825), decided more than a century earlier, where Chief Justice Marshall
            wrote for the Court that rulemaking power pertaining to the Judicial Branch may be
            "conferred on the judicial department." Discussing this delegation of rulemaking power,
            the Court found Congress authorized</p> "to make all laws which shall be necessary and
         proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by
         this constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer
         thereof. The judicial department is invested with jurisdiction in certain specified cases,
         in all which it has power to render judgment. <span class="star-pagination">*388</span>
         "That a power to make laws for carrying into execution all the judgments which the judicial
         department has power to pronounce, is expressly conferred by this clause, seems to be one
         of those plain propositions which reasoning cannot render plainer." Id., at 22. <p>See also
            Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460 (1965). Pursuant to this power to delegate rulemaking
            authority to the Judicial Branch, Congress expressly has authorized this Court to
            establish rules for the conduct of its own business and to prescribe rules of procedure
            for lower federal courts in bankruptcy cases, in other civil cases, and in criminal
            cases, and to revise the Federal Rules of Evidence. See generally J. Weinstein, Reform
            of Court Rule-Making Procedures (1977).</p>
         <p>Our approach to other nonadjudicatory activities that Congress has vested either in
            federal courts or in auxiliary bodies within the Judicial Branch has been identical to
            our approach to judicial rulemaking: consistent with the separation of powers, Congress
            may delegate to the Judicial Branch nonadjudicatory functions that do not trench upon
            the prerogatives of another Branch and that are appropriate to the central mission of
            the Judiciary. Following this approach, we specifically have upheld not only Congress'
            power to confer on the Judicial Branch the rulemaking authority contemplated in the
            various enabling Acts, but also to vest in judicial councils authority to "make `all
            necessary orders for the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the
            courts.' " Chandler v. Judicial Council, 398 U. S. 74, 86, n. 7 (1970), quoting 28 U. S.
            C. § 332 (1970 ed.). Though not the subject of constitutional challenge, by established
            practice we have recognized Congress' power to create the Judicial Conference of the
            United States, the Rules Advisory Committees that it oversees, and the Administrative
            Office of the United States Courts whose myriad responsibilities <span
               class="star-pagination">*389</span> include the administration of the entire
            probation service.<span class="sup">[15]</span> These entities, some of which are
            comprised of judges, others of judges and nonjudges, still others of nonjudges only, do
            not exercise judicial power in the constitutional sense of deciding cases and
            controversies, but they share the common purpose of providing for the fair and efficient
            fulfillment of responsibilities that are properly the province of the Judiciary. Thus,
            although the judicial power of the United States is limited by express provision of
            Article III to "Cases" and "Controversies," we have never held, and have clearly
            disavowed in practice, that the Constitution prohibits Congress from assigning to courts
            or auxiliary bodies within the Judicial Branch administrative or rulemaking duties that,
            in the words of Chief Justice Marshall, are "necessary and proper . . . for carrying
            into execution all the judgments which the judicial department has power to pronounce."
            Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat., at 22.<span class="sup">[16]</span> Because of their
               <span class="star-pagination">*390</span> close relation to the central mission of
            the Judicial Branch, such extrajudicial activities are consonant with the integrity of
            the Branch and are not more appropriate for another Branch.</p>
         <p>In light of this precedent and practice, we can discern no separation-of-powers
            impediment to the placement of the Sentencing Commission within the Judicial Branch. As
            we described at the outset, the sentencing function long has been a peculiarly shared
            responsibility among the Branches of Government and has never been thought of as the
            exclusive constitutional province of any one Branch. See, e. g., United States v.
            Addonizio, 442 U. S., at 188-189. For more than a century, federal judges have enjoyed
            wide discretion to determine the appropriate sentence in individual cases and have
            exercised special authority to determine the sentencing factors to be applied in any
            given case. Indeed, the legislative history of the Act makes clear that Congress'
            decision to place the Commission within the Judicial Branch reflected Congress' "strong
            feeling" that sentencing has been and should remain "primarily a judicial function."
            Report, at 159. That Congress should vest such rulemaking in the Judicial Branch, far
            from being "incongruous" or vesting within the Judiciary responsibilities that more
            appropriately belong to another Branch, simply acknowledges the role that <span
               class="star-pagination">*391</span> the Judiciary always has played, and continues to
            play, in sentencing.<span class="sup">[17]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Given the consistent responsibility of federal judges to pronounce sentence within the
            statutory range established by Congress, we find that the role of the Commission in
            promulgating guidelines for the exercise of that judicial function bears considerable
            similarity to the role of this Court in establishing rules of procedure under the
            various enabling Acts. Such guidelines, like the Federal Rules of Criminal and Civil
            Procedure, are court rules &#x97; rules, to paraphrase Chief Justice Marshall's language
            in Wayman, for carrying into execution judgments that the Judiciary has the power to
            pronounce. Just as the rules of procedure bind judges and courts in the proper
            management of the cases before them, so the Guidelines bind judges and courts in the
            exercise of their uncontested responsibility to pass sentence in criminal cases. In
            other words, the Commission's functions, like this Court's function in promulgating
            procedural rules, are clearly attendant to a central element of the historically
            acknowledged mission of the Judicial Branch.</p>
         <p>Petitioner nonetheless objects that the analogy between the Guidelines and the rules of
            procedure is flawed: Although the Judicial Branch may participate in rulemaking and
            administrative work that is "procedural" in nature, it may not assume, it is said, the
            "substantive" authority over sentencing <span class="star-pagination">*392</span> policy
            that Congress has delegated to the Commission. Such substantive decisionmaking,
            petitioner contends, entangles the Judicial Branch in essentially political work of the
            other Branches and unites both judicial and legislative power in the Judicial
            Branch.</p>
         <p>We agree with petitioner that the nature of the Commission's rulemaking power is not
            strictly analogous to this Court's rulemaking power under the enabling Acts. Although we
            are loath to enter the logical morass of distinguishing between substantive and
            procedural rules, see Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, 486 U. S. 717 (1988) (distinction between
            substance and procedure depends on context), and although we have recognized that the
            Federal Rules of Civil Procedure regulate matters "falling within the uncertain area
            between substance and procedure, [and] are rationally capable of classification as
            either," Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S., at 472, we recognize that the task of promulgating
            rules regulating practice and pleading before federal courts does not involve the degree
            of political judgment integral to the Commission's formulation of sentencing
               guidelines.<span class="sup">[18]</span> To be sure, all rulemaking is nonjudicial in
            the sense that rules impose standards of general application divorced from the
            individual fact situation which ordinarily forms the predicate for judicial action.
            Also, this Court's rulemaking under the enabling Acts has been substantive and political
            in the sense that the rules of procedure have important effects on the substantive
            rights of litigants.<span class="sup">[19]</span> Nonetheless, the degree of <span
               class="star-pagination">*393</span> political judgment about crime and criminality
            exercised by the Commission and the scope of the substantive effects of its work does to
            some extent set its rulemaking powers apart from prior judicial rulemaking. Cf. Miller
            v. Florida, 482 U. S. 423 (1987) (state sentencing guidelines not procedural).</p>
         <p>We do not believe, however, that the significantly political nature of the Commission's
            work renders unconstitutional its placement within the Judicial Branch. Our
            separation-of-powers analysis does not turn on the labeling of an activity as
            "substantive" as opposed to "procedural," or "political" as opposed to "judicial." See
            Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S., at 749 ("[G]overnmental power cannot always be readily
            characterized with only one . . . labe[l]") (opinion concurring in judgment). Rather,
            our inquiry is focused on the "unique aspects of the congressional plan at issue and its
            practical consequences in light of the larger concerns that underlie Article III."
            Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U. S., at 857. In this case, the
            "practical consequences" of locating the Commission within the Judicial Branch pose no
            threat of undermining the integrity of the Judicial Branch or of expanding the powers of
            the Judiciary beyond constitutional bounds by uniting within the Branch the political or
            quasi-legislative power of the Commission with the judicial power of the courts.</p>
         <p>First, although the Commission is located in the Judicial Branch, its powers are not
            united with the powers of the Judiciary in a way that has meaning for
            separation-of-powers analysis. Whatever constitutional problems might arise if the
            powers of the Commission were vested in a court, the Commission is not a court, does not
            exercise judicial power, and is not controlled by or accountable to members of the
            Judicial Branch. The Commission, on which members of the Judiciary may be a minority, is
            an independent agency in every relevant sense. In contrast to a court's exercising
            judicial power, the Commission is fully accountable to Congress, which can revoke or
            amend any or all of the Guidelines <span class="star-pagination">*394</span> as it sees
            fit either within the 180-day waiting period, see § 235(a)(1)(B)(ii)(III) of the Act, 98
            Stat. 2032, or at any time. In contrast to a court, the Commission's members are subject
            to the President's limited powers of removal. In contrast to a court, its rulemaking is
            subject to the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, 28
            U. S. C. § 994(x). While we recognize the continuing vitality of Montesquieu's
            admonition: " `Were the power of judging joined with the legislative, the life and
            liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary controul,' " The <ref type="treatise" num="47">Federalist</ref> No. 47,
            p. 326 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (Madison), quoting Montesquieu, because Congress vested the
            power to promulgate sentencing guidelines in an independent agency, not a court, there
            can be no serious argument that Congress combined legislative and judicial power within
            the Judicial Branch.<span class="sup">[20]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*395</span> Second, although the Commission wields
            rulemaking power and not the adjudicatory power exercised by individual judges when
            passing sentence, the placement of the Sentencing Commission in the Judicial Branch has
            not increased the Branch's authority. Prior to the passage of the Act, the Judicial
            Branch, as an aggregate, decided precisely the questions assigned to the Commission:
            what sentence is appropriate to what criminal conduct under what circumstances. It was
            the everyday business of judges, taken collectively, to evaluate and weigh the various
            aims of sentencing and to apply those aims to the individual cases that came before
            them. The Sentencing Commission does no more than this, albeit basically through the
            methodology of sentencing guidelines, rather than entirely individualized sentencing
            determinations. Accordingly, in placing the Commission in the Judicial Branch, Congress
            cannot be said to have aggrandized the authority of that Branch or to have deprived the
            Executive Branch of a power it once possessed. Indeed, because the Guidelines have the
            effect of promoting sentencing within a narrower range than was previously applied, the
            power of the Judicial Branch is, if anything, somewhat diminished by the Act. And, since
            Congress did not unconstitutionally delegate its own authority, the Act does not
            unconstitutionally diminish Congress' authority. Thus, although Congress has authorized
            the Commission to exercise a greater degree of political judgment than has been
            exercised in the past by any one entity within the Judicial Branch, in the unique
            context of sentencing, this authorization does nothing to upset the balance of power
            among the Branches.</p>
         <p>What Mistretta's argument comes down to, then, is not that the substantive
            responsibilities of the Commission aggrandize the Judicial Branch, but that that Branch
            is inevitably weakened by its participation in policymaking. We do not believe, however,
            that the placement within the Judicial <span class="star-pagination">*396</span> Branch
            of an independent agency charged with the promulgation of sentencing guidelines can
            possibly be construed as preventing the Judicial Branch "from accomplishing its
            constitutionally assigned functions." Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U.
            S., at 443. Despite the substantive nature of its work, the Commission is not
            incongruous or inappropriate to the Branch. As already noted, sentencing is a field in
            which the Judicial Branch long has exercised substantive or political judgment. What we
            said in Morrison when upholding the power of the Special Division to appoint independent
            counsel applies with even greater force here: "This is not a case in which judges are
            given power . . . in an area in which they have no special knowledge or expertise." 487
            U. S., at 676, n. 13. On the contrary, Congress placed the Commission in the Judicial
            Branch precisely because of the Judiciary's special knowledge and expertise.</p>
         <p>Nor do the Guidelines, though substantive, involve a degree of political authority
            inappropriate for a nonpolitical Branch. Although the Guidelines are intended to have
            substantive effects on public behavior (as do the rules of procedure), they do not bind
            or regulate the primary conduct of the public or vest in the Judicial Branch the
            legislative responsibility for establishing minimum and maximum penalties for every
            crime. They do no more than fetter the discretion of sentencing judges to do what they
            have done for generations &#x97; impose sentences within the broad limits established by
            Congress. Given their limited reach, the special role of the Judicial Branch in the
            field of sentencing, and the fact that the Guidelines are promulgated by an independent
            agency and not a court, it follows that as a matter of "practical consequences" the
            location of the Sentencing Commission within the Judicial Branch simply leaves with the
            Judiciary what long has belonged to it.</p>
         <p>In sum, since substantive judgment in the field of sentencing has been and remains
            appropriate to the Judicial Branch, and the methodology of rulemaking has been and
            remains appropriate <span class="star-pagination">*397</span> to that Branch, Congress'
            considered decision to combine these functions in an independent Sentencing Commission
            and to locate that Commission within the Judicial Branch does not violate the principle
            of separation of powers.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B</h2>
         <p/>
         <h2>Composition of the Commission</h2>
         <p>We now turn to petitioner's claim that Congress' decision to require at least three
            federal judges to serve on the Commission and to require those judges to share their
            authority with nonjudges undermines the integrity of the Judicial Branch.</p>
         <p>The Act provides in part: "At least three of [the Commission's] members shall be Federal
            judges selected [by the President] after considering a list of six judges recommended to
            the President by the Judicial Conference of the United States." 28 U. S. C. § 991(a).
            Petitioner urges us to strike down the Act on the ground that its requirement of
            judicial participation on the Commission unconstitutionally conscripts individual
            federal judges for political service and thereby undermines the essential impartiality
            of the Judicial Branch. We find Congress' requirement of judicial service somewhat
            troublesome, but we do not believe that the Act impermissibly interferes with the
            functioning of the Judiciary.</p>
         <p>The text of the Constitution contains no prohibition against the service of active
            federal judges on independent commissions such as that established by the Act. The
            Constitution does include an Incompatibility Clause applicable to national
            legislators:</p> "No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was
         elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which
         shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such
         time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a <span
            class="star-pagination">*398</span> Member of either House during his Continuance in
         Office." U. S. Const., Art. I, § 6, cl. 2. <p>No comparable restriction applies to judges,
            and we find it at least inferentially meaningful that at the Constitutional Convention
            two prohibitions against plural officeholding by members of the Judiciary were proposed,
            but did not reach the floor of the Convention for a vote.<span class="sup">[21]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Our inferential reading that the Constitution does not prohibit Article III judges from
            undertaking extrajudicial duties finds support in the historical practice of the
            Founders after ratification. Our early history indicates that the Framers themselves did
            not read the Constitution as forbidding extrajudicial service by federal judges. The
            first Chief Justice, John Jay, served simultaneously as Chief Justice and as Ambassador
            to England, where he negotiated the treaty that bears his name. Oliver Ellsworth served
            simultaneously as <span class="star-pagination">*399</span> Chief Justice and as
            Minister to France. While he was Chief Justice, John Marshall served briefly as
            Secretary of State and was a member of the Sinking Fund Commission with responsibility
            for refunding the Revolutionary War debt.</p>
         <p>All these appointments were made by the President with the "Advice and Consent" of the
            Senate. Thus, at a minimum, both the Executive and Legislative Branches acquiesced in
            the assumption of extrajudicial duties by judges. In addition, although the records of
            Congress contain no reference to the confirmation debate, Charles Warren, in his history
            of this Court, reports that the Senate specifically rejected by a vote of 18 to 8 a
            resolution proposed during the debate over Jay's nomination to the effect that such
            extrajudicial service was "contrary to the spirit of the Constitution." 1 C. Warren, The
            Supreme Court in United States History 119 (rev. ed. 1937). This contemporaneous
            practice by the Founders themselves is significant evidence that the constitutional
            principle of separation of powers does not absolutely prohibit extrajudicial service.
            See Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S., at 723-724 (actions by Members of the First Congress
            provide contemporaneous and weighty evidence about the meaning of the
               Constitution).<span class="sup">[22]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*400</span> Subsequent history, moreover, reveals a
            frequent and continuing, albeit controversial, practice of extrajudicial service.<span
               class="sup">[23]</span> In 1877, five Justices served on the Election Commission that
            resolved the hotly contested Presidential election of 1876, where Samuel J. Tilden and
            Rutherford B. Hayes were the contenders. Justices Nelson, Fuller, Brewer, Hughes, Day,
            Roberts, and Van Devanter served on various arbitral commissions. Justice Roberts was a
            member of the commission organized to investigate the attack on Pearl Harbor. Justice
            Jackson was one of the prosecutors at the Nuremberg trials; and Chief Justice Warren
            presided over the commission investigating the assassination of President Kennedy.<span
               class="sup">[24]</span> Such service has been no less a practice among lower court
            federal judges.<span class="sup">[25]</span> While these extrajudicial activities
            spawned spirited <span class="star-pagination">*401</span> discussion and frequent
            criticism, and although some of the judges who undertook these duties sometimes did so
            with reservation and may have looked back on their service with regret, "traditional
            ways of conducting government . . . give meaning" to the Constitution. Youngstown Sheet
            &amp;amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S., at 610 (concurring opinion). Our 200-year
            tradition of extrajudicial service is additional evidence that the doctrine of separated
            powers does not prohibit judicial participation in certain extrajudicial activity.<span
               class="sup">[26]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*402</span> Furthermore, although we have not specifically
            addressed the constitutionality of extrajudicial service, two of our precedents reflect
            at least an early understanding by this Court that the Constitution does not preclude
            judges from assuming extrajudicial duties in their individual capacities. In Hayburn's
            Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792), the Court considered a request for a writ of mandamus ordering
            a Circuit Court to execute a statute empowering federal and state courts to set pensions
            for disabled Revolutionary War veterans. The statute authorized the courts to determine
            monthly disability payments, but it made those determinations reviewable by the
            Secretary of War. Because Congress by an amendment of the statute rendered the case
            moot, the Court did not pass on the constitutional issue. Mr. Dallas, in reporting the
            case, included in the margin three Circuit Court rulings on the statute. All three
            concluded that the powers conferred could not be performed by an Article III court. The
            "judicial Power" of the United States did not extend to duties more properly performed
            by the Executive. See Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S., at 677-678, n. 15 (characterizing
            Hayburn's Case). As this Court later observed in United States v. Ferreira, <span
               class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/rMc/united-states-v-ferreira/">

               </a>
            </span> (1852), however, the New York Circuit, in 1791, with a bench consisting of Chief
            Justice Jay, Justice Cushing, and District Judge Duane, believed that individual judges
            acting not in their judicial capacities but as individual commissioners could exercise
            the duties conferred upon them by the statute. Neither of the other two courts expressed
            a definitive view whether judges acting as commissioners could make disability
            determinations reviewable by the Secretary of War. In Ferreira, however, this Court
            concluded that although the Circuit Courts were not fully in agreement as to whether the
            statute could be construed as conferring the duties on the judges as commissioners, if
            the statute was subject to that construction "there seems to have been no doubt, <span
               class="star-pagination">*403</span> at that time, but that they might
            constitutionally exercise it, and the Secretary constitutionally revise their
            decisions." Id., at 50.</p>
         <p>Ferreira itself concerned a statute authorizing a Federal District Court in Florida to
            adjudicate claims for losses for which the United States was responsible under the 1819
            treaty by which Spain ceded Florida to the United States. As in Hayburn's Case, the
            court's determination was to be reported to an executive officer, the Secretary of the
            Treasury, who would exercise final judgment as to whether the claims should be paid. 13
            How., at 45-47. This Court recognized that the powers conferred on the District Court
            were "judicial in their nature," in the sense that they called for "judgment and
            discretion." Id., at 48. Nonetheless, we concluded that those powers were not "judicial
            . . . in the sense in which judicial power is granted by the Constitution to the courts
            of the United States." Ibid. Because the District Court's decision was not an exercise
            of judicial power, this Court found itself without jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Id.,
            at 51-52.</p>
         <p>We did not conclude in Ferreira, however, that Congress could not confer on a federal
            judge the function of resolving administrative claims. On the contrary, we expressed
            general agreement with the view of some of the judges in Hayburn's Case that while such
            administrative duties could not be assigned to a court, or to judges acting as part of a
            court, such duties could be assigned to judges acting individually as commissioners.
            Although we did not decide the question, we expressed reservation about whether the
            District Judge in Florida could act legitimately as a commissioner since he was not
            appointed as such by the President pursuant to his Article II power to appoint officers
            of the United States. 13 How., at 51. In sum, Ferreira, like Hayburn's Case, suggests
            that Congress may authorize a federal judge, in an individual capacity, to perform an
            executive function without violating the separation of powers. <span
               class="star-pagination">*404</span> Accord, United States v. Yale Todd (1794)
            (unreported decision discussed in the margin of the opinion in Ferreira, 13 How., at
            52-53).</p>
         <p>In light of the foregoing history and precedent, we conclude that the principle of
            separation of powers does not absolutely prohibit Article III judges from serving on
            commissions such as that created by the Act. The judges serve on the Sentencing
            Commission not pursuant to their status and authority as Article III judges, but solely
            because of their appointment by the President as the Act directs. Such power as these
            judges wield as Commissioners is not judicial power; it is administrative power derived
            from the enabling legislation. Just as the nonjudicial members of the Commission act as
            administrators, bringing their experience and wisdom to bear on the problems of
            sentencing disparity, so too the judges, uniquely qualified on the subject of
            sentencing, assume a wholly administrative role upon entering into the deliberations of
            the Commission. In other words, the Constitution, at least as a per se matter, does not
            forbid judges to wear two hats; it merely forbids them to wear both hats at the same
            time.</p>
         <p>This is not to suggest, of course, that every kind of extrajudicial service under every
            circumstance necessarily accords with the Constitution. That the Constitution does not
            absolutely prohibit a federal judge from assuming extrajudicial duties does not mean
            that every extrajudicial service would be compatible with, or appropriate to, continuing
            service on the bench; nor does it mean that Congress may require a federal judge to
            assume extrajudicial duties as long as the judge is assigned those duties in an
            individual, not judicial, capacity. The ultimate inquiry remains whether a particular
            extrajudicial assignment undermines the integrity of the Judicial Branch.<span
               class="sup">[27]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*405</span> With respect to the Sentencing Commission, we
            understand petitioner to argue that the service required of at least three judges
            presents two distinct threats to the integrity of the Judicial Branch. Regardless of
            constitutionality, this mandatory service, it is said, diminishes the independence of
            the Judiciary. See Brief for Petitioner 28. It is further claimed that the participation
            of judges on the Commission improperly lends judicial prestige and an aura of judicial
            impartiality to the Commission's political work. The involvement of Article III judges
            in the process of policymaking, petitioner asserts, " `[w]eakens confidence in the
            disinterestedness of the judicatory functions.' " Ibid., quoting F. Frankfurter,
            Advisory Opinions, in 1 Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences 475, 478 (1930).</p>
         <p>In our view, petitioner significantly overstates the mandatory nature of Congress'
            directive that at least three members of the Commission shall be federal judges, as well
            as the effect of this service on the practical operation of the Judicial Branch. Service
            on the Commission by any particular judge is voluntary. The Act does not conscript
            judges for the Commission. No Commission member to date has been appointed without his
            consent and we have no reason to believe that the Act confers upon the President any
            authority to <span class="star-pagination">*406</span> force a judge to serve on the
            Commission against his will.<span class="sup">[28]</span> Accordingly, we simply do not
            face the question whether Congress may require a particular judge to undertake the
            extrajudicial duty of serving on the Commission. In Chandler v. Judicial Council, 398 U.
            S. 74 (1970), we found "no constitutional obstacle preventing Congress from vesting in
            the Circuit Judicial Councils, as administrative bodies," authority to administer " `the
            business of the courts within [each] circuit.' " Id., at 86, n. 7, quoting 28 U. S. C. §
            332 (1970 ed.).<span class="sup">[29]</span> Indeed, Congress has created numerous
            nonadjudicatory bodies, such as the Judicial Conference, that are composed entirely, or
            in part, of federal judges. See 28 U. S. C. §§ 331, 332; see generally Meador, The
            Federal Judiciary and Its Future Administration, 65 Va. L. Rev. 1031 (1979).
            Accordingly, absent a more specific threat to judicial independence, the fact that
            Congress has included federal judges on the Commission does not itself threaten the
            integrity of the Judicial Branch.</p>
         <p>Moreover, we cannot see how the service of federal judges on the Commission will have a
            constitutionally significant practical effect on the operation of the Judicial Branch.
            We see no reason why service on the Commission should result in widespread judicial
            recusals. That federal judges participate <span class="star-pagination">*407</span> in
            the promulgation of guidelines does not affect their or other judges' ability
            impartially to adjudicate sentencing issues. Cf. Mississippi Publishing Corp. v.
            Murphree, 326 U. S. 438 (1946) (that this Court promulgated the Federal Rules of Civil
            Procedure did not foreclose its consideration of challenges to their validity). While in
            the abstract a proliferation of commissions with congressionally mandated judiciary
            participation might threaten judicial independence by exhausting the resources of the
            Judicial Branch, that danger is far too remote for consideration here.</p>
         <p>We are somewhat more troubled by petitioner's argument that the Judiciary's entanglement
            in the political work of the Commission undermines public confidence in the
            disinterestedness of the Judicial Branch. While the problem of individual bias is
            usually cured through recusal, no such mechanism can overcome the appearance of
            institutional partiality that may arise from judiciary involvement in the making of
            policy. The legitimacy of the Judicial Branch ultimately depends on its reputation for
            impartiality and nonpartisanship. That reputation may not be borrowed by the political
            Branches to cloak their work in the neutral colors of judicial action.</p>
         <p>Although it is a judgment that is not without difficulty, we conclude that the
            participation of federal judges on the Sentencing Commission does not threaten, either
            in fact or in appearance, the impartiality of the Judicial Branch. We are drawn to this
            conclusion by one paramount consideration: that the Sentencing Commission is devoted
            exclusively to the development of rules to rationalize a process that has been and will
            continue to be performed exclusively by the Judicial Branch. In our view, this is an
            essentially neutral endeavor and one in which judicial participation is peculiarly
            appropriate. Judicial contribution to the enterprise of creating rules to limit the
            discretion of sentencing judges does not enlist the resources or reputation of the
            Judicial Branch in either the legislative business of determining what conduct should be
            criminalized or the executive business of enforcing the law. <span
               class="star-pagination">*408</span> Rather, judicial participation on the Commission
            ensures that judicial experience and expertise will inform the promulgation of rules for
            the exercise of the Judicial Branch's own business &#x97; that of passing sentence on
            every criminal defendant. To this end, Congress has provided, not inappropriately, for a
            significant judicial voice on the Commission.</p>
         <p>Justice Jackson underscored in Youngstown that the Constitution anticipates
            "reciprocity" among the Branches. 343 U. S., at 635. As part of that reciprocity and as
            part of the integration of dispersed powers into a workable government, Congress may
            enlist the assistance of judges in the creation of rules to govern the Judicial Branch.
            Our principle of separation of powers anticipates that the coordinate Branches will
            converse with each other on matters of vital common interest. While we have some
            reservation that Congress required such a dialogue in this case, the Constitution does
            not prohibit Congress from enlisting federal judges to present a uniquely judicial view
            on the uniquely judicial subject of sentencing. In this case, at least, where the
            subject lies so close to the heart of the judicial function and where purposes of the
            Commission are not inherently partisan, such enlistment is not coercion or co-optation,
            but merely assurance of judicial participation.</p>
         <p>Finally, we reject petitioner's argument that the mixed nature of the Commission
            violates the Constitution by requiring Article III judges to share judicial power with
            nonjudges. As noted earlier, the Commission is not a court and exercises no judicial
            power. Thus, the Act does not vest Article III power in nonjudges or require Article III
            judges to share their power with nonjudges.</p>

         <h2>C</h2>
         <p/>
         <h2>Presidential Control</h2>
         <p>The Act empowers the President to appoint all seven members of the Commission with the
            advice and consent of the Senate. The Act further provides that the President shall make
            his choice of judicial appointees to the Commission after considering a list of six
            judges recommended by the Judicial <span class="star-pagination">*409</span> Conference
            of the United States. The Act also grants the President authority to remove members of
            the Commission, although "only for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office or for other
            good cause shown." 28 U. S. C. § 991(a).</p>
         <p>Mistretta argues that this power of Presidential appointment and removal prevents the
            Judicial Branch from performing its constitutionally assigned functions.<span
               class="sup">[30]</span> See Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S., at
            443. Although we agree with petitioner that the independence of the Judicial Branch must
            be "jealously guarded" against outside interference, see Northern Pipeline Co. v.
            Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S., at 60, and that, as Madison admonished at the
            founding, "neither of [the Branches] ought to possess directly or indirectly, an
            overruling influence over the others in the administration of their respective powers,"
            The <ref type="treatise" num="48">Federalist</ref> No. 48, p. 332 (J. Cooke ed. 1961), we do not believe that the
            President's appointment and removal powers over the Commission afford him influence over
            the functions of the Judicial Branch or undue sway over its members.</p>
         <p>The notion that the President's power to appoint federal judges to the Commission
            somehow gives him influence over the Judicial Branch or prevents, even potentially, the
            Judicial Branch from performing its constitutionally assigned functions is fanciful. We
            have never considered it incompatible with the functioning of the Judicial Branch that
            the President has the power to elevate federal judges from one level to another or to
            tempt judges away from the bench with Executive Branch positions. The mere fact that the
            President within his appointment portfolio has positions that may be attractive to
            federal judges does not, of itself, corrupt the integrity of the Judiciary. Were the
            impartiality of the Judicial <span class="star-pagination">*410</span> Branch so easily
            subverted, our constitutional system of tripartite Government would have failed long
            ago. We simply cannot imagine that federal judges will comport their actions to the
            wishes of the President for the purpose of receiving an appointment to the Sentencing
               Commission.<span class="sup">[31]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The President's removal power over Commission members poses a similarly negligible
            threat to judicial independence. The Act does not, and could not under the Constitution,
            authorize the President to remove, or in any way diminish the status of Article III
            judges, as judges. Even if removed from the Commission, a federal judge appointed to the
            Commission would continue, absent impeachment, to enjoy tenure "during good Behavior"
            and a full judicial salary. U. S. Const., Art. III, § 1.<span class="sup">[32]</span>
            Also, the President's removal power under the Act is limited. In order to safeguard the
            independence of the Commission from executive control, Congress specified in the Act
            that the President may remove the Commission members only for good cause.<span
               class="sup">[33]</span> Such congressional <span class="star-pagination">*411</span>
            limitation on the President's removal power, like the removal provisions upheld in
            Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988), and Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295
            U. S. 602 (1935), is specifically crafted to prevent the President from exercising
            "coercive influence" over independent agencies. See Morrison, 487 U. S., at 688;
            Humphrey's Executor, 295 U. S., at 630.</p>
         <p>In other words, since the President has no power to affect the tenure or compensation of
            Article III judges, even if the Act authorized him to remove judges from the Commission
            at will, he would have no power to coerce the judges in the exercise of their judicial
               duties.<span class="sup">[34]</span> In any case, Congress did not grant the
            President unfettered authority to remove Commission members. Instead, precisely to
            ensure that they would not be subject to coercion even in the exercise of their
            nonjudicial duties, Congress insulated the members from Presidential removal except for
            good cause. Under these circumstances, we see no risk that the President's limited
            removal power will compromise the impartiality of Article III judges serving on the
            Commission and, consequently, no risk that the Act's removal provision will prevent the
            Judicial Branch from performing its constitutionally assigned function of fairly
            adjudicating cases and controversies.<span class="sup">[35]</span>

            <span class="star-pagination">*412</span> V</h2>
         <p>We conclude that in creating the Sentencing Commission &#x97; an unusual hybrid in
            structure and authority &#x97; Congress neither delegated excessive legislative power
            nor upset the constitutionally mandated balance of powers among the coordinate Branches.
            The Constitution's structural protections do not prohibit Congress from delegating to an
            expert body located within the Judicial Branch the intricate task of formulating
            sentencing guidelines consistent with such significant statutory direction as is present
            here. Nor does our system of checked and balanced authority prohibit Congress from
            calling upon the accumulated wisdom and experience of the Judicial Branch in creating
            policy on a matter uniquely within the ken of judges. Accordingly, we hold that the Act
            is constitutional.</p>

            <span class="star-pagination">*413</span> JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting.</p>
         <p>While the products of the Sentencing Commission's labors have been given the modest name
            "Guidelines," see 28 U. S. C. § 994(a)(1) (1982 ed., Supp. IV); United States Sentencing
            Commission Guidelines Manual (June 15, 1988), they have the force and effect of laws,
            prescribing the sentences criminal defendants are to receive. A judge who disregards
            them will be reversed, 18 U. S. C. § 3742 (1982 ed., Supp. IV). I dissent from today's
            decision because I can find no place within our constitutional system for an agency
            created by Congress to exercise no governmental power other than the making of laws.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>There is no doubt that the Sentencing Commission has established significant, legally
            binding prescriptions governing application of governmental power against private
            individuals &#x97; indeed, application of the ultimate governmental power, short of
            capital punishment.<span class="sup">[1]</span> Statutorily permissible sentences for
            particular crimes cover as broad a range as zero years to life, see, e. g., 18 U. S. C.
            § 1201 (1982 ed. and Supp. IV) (kidnaping), and within those ranges the Commission was
            given broad discretion to prescribe the "correct" sentence, 28 U. S. C. § 994(b)(2)
            (1982 ed., Supp. IV). Average prior sentences were to be a starting point for the
            Commission's inquiry, § 994(m), but it could and regularly did deviate from those
            averages as it thought appropriate. It chose, for example, to prescribe substantial
            increases over average prior sentences for white-collar crimes such as public
            corruption, antitrust violations, and tax evasion. Guidelines, <span
               class="star-pagination">*414</span> at 2.31, 2.133, 2.140. For antitrust violations,
            before the Guidelines, only 39% of those convicted served any imprisonment, and the
            average imprisonment was only 45 days, id., at 2.133, whereas the Guidelines prescribe
            base sentences (for defendants with no prior criminal conviction) ranging from 2-to-8
            months to 10-to-16 months, depending upon the volume of commerce involved. See id., at
            2.131, 5.2.</p>
         <p>The Commission also determined when probation was permissible, imposing a strict system
            of controls because of its judgment that probation had been used for an "inappropriately
            high percentage of offenders guilty of certain economic crimes." Id., at 1.8. Moreover,
            the Commission had free rein in determining whether statutorily authorized fines should
            be imposed in addition to imprisonment, and if so, in what amounts. It ultimately
            decided that every nonindigent offender should pay a fine according to a schedule
            devised by the Commission. Id., at 5.18. Congress also gave the Commission discretion to
            determine whether 7 specified characteristics of offenses, and 11 specified
            characteristics of offenders, "have any relevance," and should be included among the
            factors varying the sentence. 28 U. S. C. §§ 994(c), (d) (1982 ed., Supp. IV). Of the
            latter, it included only three among the factors required to be considered, and declared
            the remainder not ordinarily relevant. Guidelines, at 5.29-5.31.</p>
         <p>It should be apparent from the above that the decisions made by the Commission are far
            from technical, but are heavily laden (or ought to be) with value judgments and policy
            assessments. This fact is sharply reflected in the Commission's product, as described by
            the dissenting Commissioner:</p> "Under the guidelines, the judge could give the same
         sentence for abusive sexual contact that puts the child in fear as for unlawfully entering
         or remaining in the United States. Similarly, the guidelines permit equivalent sentences
         for the following pairs of offenses: drug <span class="star-pagination">*415</span>
         trafficking and a violation of the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act; arson with a
         destructive device and failure to surrender a cancelled naturalization certificate;
         operation of a common carrier under the influence of drugs that causes injury and
         alteration of one motor vehicle identification number; illegal trafficking in explosives
         and trespass; interference with a flight attendant and unlawful conduct relating to
         contraband cigarettes; aggravated assault and smuggling $11,000 worth of fish." Dissenting
         View of Commissioner Paul H. Robinson on the Promulgation of the Sentencing Guidelines by
         the United States Sentencing Commission 6-7 (May 1, 1987) (citations omitted).
            <p>Petitioner's most fundamental and far-reaching challenge to the Commission is that
            Congress' commitment of such broad policy responsibility to any institution is an
            unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. It is difficult to imagine a principle
            more essential to democratic government than that upon which the doctrine of
            unconstitutional delegation is founded: Except in a few areas constitutionally committed
            to the Executive Branch, the basic policy decisions governing society are to be made by
            the Legislature. Our Members of Congress could not, even if they wished, vote all power
            to the President and adjourn sine die.</p>
         <p>But while the doctrine of unconstitutional delegation is unquestionably a fundamental
            element of our constitutional system, it is not an element readily enforceable by the
            courts. Once it is conceded, as it must be, that no statute can be entirely precise, and
            that some judgments, even some judgments involving policy considerations, must be left
            to the officers executing the law and to the judges applying it, the debate over
            unconstitutional delegation becomes a debate not over a point of principle but over a
            question of degree. As Chief Justice Taft expressed the point for the Court in the
            landmark case of J. W. Hampton, Jr., &amp;amp; Co. v. United <span
               class="star-pagination">*416</span> States, 276 U. S. 394, 406 (1928), the limits of
            delegation "must be fixed according to common sense and the inherent necessities of the
            governmental co-ordination." Since Congress is no less endowed with common sense than we
            are, and better equipped to inform itself of the "necessities" of government; and since
            the factors bearing upon those necessities are both multifarious and (in the nonpartisan
            sense) highly political &#x97; including, for example, whether the Nation is at war, see
            Yakus v. United States, 321 U. S. 414 (1944), or whether for other reasons "emergency is
            instinct in the situation," Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North
            America v. Connally, <span class="citation">

            </span>, 752 (DC 1971) (three-judge court) &#x97; it is small wonder that we have almost
            never felt qualified to second-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree of policy
            judgment that can be left to those executing or applying the law. As the Court points
            out, we have invoked the doctrine of unconstitutional delegation to invalidate a law
            only twice in our history, over half a century ago. See Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293
            U. S. 388 (1935); A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U. S. 495
            (1935). What legislated standard, one must wonder, can possibly be too vague to survive
            judicial scrutiny, when we have repeatedly upheld, in various contexts, a "public
            interest" standard? See, e. g., National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U. S.
            190, 216-217 (1943); New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States, 287 U. S. 12,
            24-25 (1932).</p>
         <p>In short, I fully agree with the Court's rejection of petitioner's contention that the
            doctrine of unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority has been violated
            because of the lack of intelligible, congressionally prescribed standards to guide the
            Commission.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>Precisely because the scope of delegation is largely uncontrollable by the courts, we
            must be particularly rigorous in <span class="star-pagination">*417</span> preserving
            the Constitution's structural restrictions that deter excessive delegation. The major
            one, it seems to me, is that the power to make law cannot be exercised by anyone other
            than Congress, except in conjunction with the lawful exercise of executive or judicial
            power.</p>
         <p>The whole theory of lawful congressional "delegation" is not that Congress is sometimes
            too busy or too divided and can therefore assign its responsibility of making law to
            someone else; but rather that a certain degree of discretion, and thus of lawmaking,
            inheres in most executive or judicial action, and it is up to Congress, by the relative
            specificity or generality of its statutory commands, to determine &#x97; up to a point
            &#x97; how small or how large that degree shall be. Thus, the courts could be given the
            power to say precisely what constitutes a "restraint of trade," see Standard Oil Co. of
            New Jersey v. United States, 221 U. S. 1 (1911), or to adopt rules of procedure, see
            Sibbach v. Wilson &amp;amp; Co., 312 U. S. 1, 22 (1941), or to prescribe by rule the
            manner in which their officers shall execute their judgments, Wayman v. Southard, <span

            powers. And the Executive could be given the power to adopt policies and rules
            specifying in detail what radio and television licenses will be in the "public interest,
            convenience or necessity," because that was ancillary to the exercise of its executive
            powers in granting and policing licenses and making a "fair and equitable allocation" of
            the electromagnetic spectrum. See Federal Radio Comm'n v. Nelson Brothers Bond &amp;amp;

            within the statutorily prescribed limits because that was ancillary to their exercise of
            the judicial power of pronouncing sentence upon individual defendants. And the
            President, through the Parole Commission subject to his appointment and removal, could
            be given the power to issue Guidelines specifying when parole would be available,
            because that was ancillary to the President's exercise of the executive power to hold
            and release federal prisoners. See 18 U. S. C. §§ 4203(a)(1) and (b); 28 CFR § 2.20

         `The true distinction . . . is between the delegation of power to make the law, which
         necessarily involves a discretion as to what it shall be, and conferring authority or
         discretion as to its execution, to be exercised under and in pursuance of the law. The
         first cannot be done; to the latter no valid objection can be made.' " Id., at 693-694

            upheld a statutory grant of authority to the Secretary of Agriculture to make rules and
            regulations governing use of the public forests he was charged with managing, the Court
            said:</p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*419</span> "From the beginning of the Government various
         acts have been passed conferring upon executive officers power to make rules and
         regulations &#x97; not for the government of their departments, but for administering the
         laws which did govern. None of these statutes could confer legislative power." (Emphasis
         added.) <p>Or, finally, as Chief Justice Taft described it in Hampton &amp;amp; Co., 276 U.
            S., at 406:</p> "The field of Congress involves all and many varieties of legislative
         action, and Congress has found it frequently necessary to use officers of the Executive
         Branch, within defined limits, to secure the exact effect intended by its acts of
         legislation, by vesting discretion in such officers to make public regulations interpreting
         a statute and directing the details of its execution, even to the extent of providing for
         penalizing a breach of such regulations." (Emphasis added.) <p>The focus of controversy, in
            the long line of our so-called excessive delegation cases, has been whether the degree
            of generality contained in the authorization for exercise of executive or judicial
            powers in a particular field is so unacceptably high as to amount to a delegation of
            legislative powers. I say "so-called excessive delegation" because although that
            convenient terminology is often used, what is really at issue is whether there has been
            any delegation of legislative power, which occurs (rarely) when Congress authorizes the
            exercise of executive or judicial power without adequate standards. Strictly speaking,
            there is no acceptable delegation of legislative power. As John Locke put it almost 300
            years ago, "[t]he power of the legislative being derived from the people by a positive
            voluntary grant and institution, can be no other, than what the positive grant conveyed,
            which being only to make laws, and not to make legislators, the legislative <span
               class="star-pagination">*420</span> can have no power to transfer their authority of
            making laws, and place it in other hands." J. Locke, Second Treatise of Government 87
            (R. Cox ed. 1982) (emphasis added). Or as we have less epigrammatically said: "That
            Congress cannot delegate legislative power to the President is a principle universally
            recognized as vital to the integrity and maintenance of the system of government
            ordained by the Constitution." Field v. Clark, supra, at 692. In the present case,
            however, a pure delegation of legislative power is precisely what we have before us. It
            is irrelevant whether the standards are adequate, because they are not standards related
            to the exercise of executive or judicial powers; they are, plainly and simply, standards
            for further legislation.</p>
         <p>The lawmaking function of the Sentencing Commission is completely divorced from any
            responsibility for execution of the law or adjudication of private rights under the law.
            It is divorced from responsibility for execution of the law not only because the
            Commission is not said to be "located in the Executive Branch" (as I shall discuss
            presently, I doubt whether Congress can "locate" an entity within one Branch or another
            for constitutional purposes by merely saying so); but, more importantly, because the
            Commission neither exercises any executive power on its own, nor is subject to the
            control of the President who does. The only functions it performs, apart from
            prescribing the law, 28 U. S. C. §§ 994(a) (1), (3) (1982 ed., Supp. IV), conducting the
            investigations useful and necessary for prescribing the law, e. g., §§ 995(a) (13),
            (15), (16), (21), and clarifying the intended application of the law that it prescribes,
            e. g., §§ 994(a)(2), 995(a)(10), are data collection and intragovernmental advice giving
            and education, e. g., §§ 995(a)(8), (9), (12), (17), (18), (20). These latter activities
            &#x97; similar to functions performed by congressional agencies and even congressional
            staff &#x97; neither determine nor affect private rights, and do not constitute an
            exercise of governmental power. See Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U. S. 602,
            628 (1935). And the Commission's <span class="star-pagination">*421</span> lawmaking is
            completely divorced from the exercise of judicial powers since, not being a court, it
            has no judicial powers itself, nor is it subject to the control of any other body with
            judicial powers. The power to make law at issue here, in other words, is not ancillary
            but quite naked. The situation is no different in principle from what would exist if
            Congress gave the same power of writing sentencing laws to a congressional agency such
            as the General Accounting Office, or to members of its staff.</p>
         <p>The delegation of lawmaking authority to the Commission is, in short, unsupported by any
            legitimating theory to explain why it is not a delegation of legislative power. To
            disregard structural legitimacy is wrong in itself &#x97; but since structure has
            purpose, the disregard also has adverse practical consequences. In this case, as
            suggested earlier, the consequence is to facilitate and encourage judicially
            uncontrollable delegation. Until our decision last Term in Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S.
            654 (1988), it could have been said that Congress could delegate lawmaking authority
            only at the expense of increasing the power of either the President or the courts. Most
            often, as a practical matter, it would be the President, since the judicial process is
            unable to conduct the investigations and make the political assessments essential for
            most policymaking. Thus, the need for delegation would have to be important enough to
            induce Congress to aggrandize its primary competitor for political power, and the
            recipient of the policymaking authority, while not Congress itself, would at least be
            politically accountable. But even after it has been accepted, pursuant to Morrison, that
            those exercising executive power need not be subject to the control of the President,
            Congress would still be more reluctant to augment the power of even an independent
            executive agency than to create an otherwise powerless repository for its delegation.
            Moreover, assembling the full-time senior personnel for an agency exercising executive
            powers is more difficult than borrowing other officials (or employing new officers on a
               <span class="star-pagination">*422</span> short-term basis) to head an organization
            such as the Sentencing Commission.</p>
         <p>By reason of today's decision, I anticipate that Congress will find delegation of its
            lawmaking powers much more attractive in the future. If rulemaking can be entirely
            unrelated to the exercise of judicial or executive powers, I foresee all manner of
            "expert" bodies, insulated from the political process, to which Congress will delegate
            various portions of its lawmaking responsibility. How tempting to create an expert
            Medical Commission (mostly M.D.'s, with perhaps a few Ph.D.'s in moral philosophy) to
            dispose of such thorny, "no-win" political issues as the withholding of life-support
            systems in federally funded hospitals, or the use of fetal tissue for research. This is
            an undemocratic precedent that we set &#x97; not because of the scope of the delegated
            power, but because its recipient is not one of the three Branches of Government. The
            only governmental power the Commission possesses is the power to make law; and it is not
            the Congress.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>The strange character of the body that the Court today approves, and its incompatibility
            with our constitutional institutions, is apparent from that portion of the Court's
            opinion entitled "Location of the Commission." This accepts at the outset that the
            Commission is a "body within the Judicial Branch," ante, at 385, and rests some of its
            analysis upon that asserted reality. Separation-of-powers problems are dismissed,
            however, on the ground that "[the Commission's] powers are not united with the powers of
            the Judiciary in a way that has meaning for separation-of-powers analysis," since the
            Commission "is not a court, does not exercise judicial power, and is not controlled by
            or accountable to members of the Judicial Branch," ante, at 393. In light of the latter
            concession, I am at a loss to understand why the Commission is "within the Judicial
            Branch" in any sense that has relevance to today's discussion. I am sure that Congress
            can <span class="star-pagination">*423</span> divide up the Government any way it
            wishes, and employ whatever terminology it desires, for nonconstitutional purposes
            &#x97; for example, perhaps the statutory designation that the Commission is "within the
            Judicial Branch" places it outside the coverage of certain laws which say they are
            inapplicable to that Branch, such as the Freedom of Information Act, see 5 U. S. C. §
            552(f) (1982 ed., Supp. IV). For such statutory purposes, Congress can define the term
            as it pleases. But since our subject here is the Constitution, to admit that that
            congressional designation "has [no] meaning for separation-of-powers analysis" is to
            admit that the Court must therefore decide for itself where the Commission is located
            for purposes of separation-of-powers analysis.</p>
         <p>It would seem logical to decide the question of which Branch an agency belongs to on the
            basis of who controls its actions: If Congress, the Legislative Branch; if the
            President, the Executive Branch; if the courts (or perhaps the judges), the Judicial
            Branch. See, e. g., Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 727-732 (1986). In Humphrey's
            Executor v. United States, 295 U. S. 602 (1986), we approved the concept of an agency
            that was controlled by (and thus within) none of the Branches. We seem to have assumed,
            however, that that agency (the old Federal Trade Commission, before it acquired many of
            its current functions) exercised no governmental power whatever, but merely assisted
            Congress and the courts in the performance of their functions. See id., at 628. Where no
            governmental power is at issue, there is no strict constitutional impediment to a
            "branchless" agency, since it is only "[a]ll legislative Powers," Art. I, § 1, "[t]he
            executive Power," Art. II, § 1, and "[t]he judicial Power," Art. III, § 1, which the
            Constitution divides into three departments. (As an example of a "branchless" agency
            exercising no governmental powers, one can conceive of an Advisory Commission charged
            with reporting to all three Branches, whose members are removable only for cause and are
            thus subject to the control of none of the Branches.) Over the years, however, <span
               class="star-pagination">*424</span> Humphrey's Executor has come in general
            contemplation to stand for something quite different &#x97; not an "independent agency"
            in the sense of an agency independent of all three Branches, but an "independent agency"
            in the sense of an agency within the Executive Branch (and thus authorized to exercise
            executive powers) independent of the control of the President.</p>
         <p>We approved that concept last Term in Morrison. See 487 U. S., at 688-691. I dissented
            in that case, essentially because I thought that concept illogical and destructive of
            the structure of the Constitution. I must admit, however, that today's next step &#x97;
            recognition of an independent agency in the Judicial Branch &#x97; makes Morrison seem,
            by comparison, rigorously logical. "The Commission," we are told, "is an independent
            agency in every relevant sense." Ante, at 393. There are several problems with this.
            First, once it is acknowledged that an "independent agency" may be within any of the
            three Branches, and not merely within the Executive, then there really is no basis for
            determining what Branch such an agency belongs to, and thus what governmental powers it
            may constitutionally be given, except (what the Court today uses) Congress' say-so. More
            importantly, however, the concept of an "independent agency" simply does not translate
            into the legislative or judicial spheres. Although the Constitution says that "[t]he
            executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America," Art.
            II, § 1, it was never thought that the President would have to exercise that power
            personally. He may generally authorize others to exercise executive powers, with full
            effect of law, in his place. See, e. g., Wolsey v. Chapman, 101 U. S. 755 (1880);
            Williams v. United States, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/rDf/williams-v-united-states/">
                  <span class="volume">1</span>
                  <span class="reporter">How.</span>
                  <span class="page">290</span>
               </a>
            </span> (1843). It is already a leap from the proposition that a person who is not the
            President may exercise executive powers to the proposition we accepted in Morrison that
            a person who is neither the President nor subject to the President's control may
            exercise executive powers. But with <span class="star-pagination">*425</span> respect to
            the exercise of judicial powers (the business of the Judicial Branch) the platform for
            such a leap does not even exist. For unlike executive power, judicial and legislative
            powers have never been thought delegable. A judge may not leave the decision to his law
            clerk, or to a master. See United States v. Raddatz, 447 U. S. 667, 683 (1980); cf.
            Runkle v. United States, 122 U. S. 543 (1887). Senators and Members of the House may not
            send delegates to consider and vote upon bills in their place. See Rules of the House of
            Representatives, Rule VIII(3); Standing Rules of the United States Senate, Rule XII.
            Thus, however well established may be the "independent agencies" of the Executive
            Branch, here we have an anomaly beyond equal: an independent agency exercising
            governmental power on behalf of a Branch where all governmental power is supposed to be
            exercised personally by the judges of courts.<span class="sup">[3]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Today's decision may aptly be described as the Humphrey's Executor of the Judicial
            Branch, and I think we will live to regret it. Henceforth there may be agencies "within
            the Judicial Branch" (whatever that means), exercising governmental powers, that are
            neither courts nor controlled by courts, nor even controlled by judges. If an
            "independent agency" such as this can be given the power to fix sentences previously
            exercised by district courts, I must assume that a similar agency can be given the
            powers to adopt rules of procedure <span class="star-pagination">*426</span> and rules
            of evidence previously exercised by this Court. The bases for distinction would be thin
            indeed.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>* * *</h2>
         <p>Today's decision follows the regrettable tendency of our recent separation-of-powers
            jurisprudence, see Morrison, supra; Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S.
            A., 481 U. S. 787 (1987), to treat the Constitution as though it were no more than a
            generalized prescription that the functions of the Branches should not be commingled too
            much &#x97; how much is too much to be determined, case-by-case, by this Court. The
            Constitution is not that. Rather, as its name suggests, it is a prescribed structure, a
            framework, for the conduct of government. In designing that structure, the Framers
            themselves considered how much commingling was, in the generality of things, acceptable,
            and set forth their conclusions in the document. That is the meaning of the statements
            concerning acceptable commingling made by Madison in defense of the proposed
            Constitution, and now routinely used as an excuse for disregarding it. When he said, as
            the Court correctly quotes, that separation of powers " `d[oes] not mean that these
            [three] departments ought to have no partial agency in, or no controul over the acts of
            each other,' " ante, at 380-381, quoting The <ref type="intent" num="47">Federalist</ref> No. 47, pp. 325-326 (J. Cooke
            ed. 1961), his point was that the commingling specifically provided for in the structure
            that he and his colleagues had designed &#x97; the Presidential veto over legislation,
            the Senate's confirmation of executive and judicial officers, the Senate's ratification
            of treaties, the Congress' power to impeach and remove executive and judicial officers
            &#x97; did not violate a proper understanding of separation of powers. He would be
            aghast, I think, to hear those words used as justification for ignoring that carefully
            designed structure so long as, in the changing view of the Supreme Court from time to
            time, "too much commingling" does not occur. Consideration of the degree of commingling
            that a particular disposition produces may be appropriate at <span
               class="star-pagination">*427</span> the margins, where the outline of the framework
            itself is not clear; but it seems to me far from a marginal question whether our
            constitutional structure allows for a body which is not the Congress, and yet exercises
            no governmental powers except the making of rules that have the effect of laws.</p>
         <p>I think the Court errs, in other words, not so much because it mistakes the degree of
            commingling, but because it fails to recognize that this case is not about commingling,
            but about the creation of a new Branch altogether, a sort of junior-varsity Congress. It
            may well be that in some circumstances such a Branch would be desirable; perhaps the
            agency before us here will prove to be so. But there are many desirable dispositions
            that do not accord with the constitutional structure we live under. And in the long run
            the improvisation of a constitutional structure on the basis of currently perceived
            utility will be disastrous.</p>
         <p>I respectfully dissent from the Court's decision, and would reverse the judgment of the
            District Court.</p>

         <p>[2] The District Court's memorandum, written by Judge Howard F. Sachs, states that his
            conclusion that "the Guidelines are not subject to valid challenge" by claims based on
            the Commission's lack of constitutional status or on a theory of unconstitutional
            delegation of legislative power, 682 F. Supp., at 1033-1034, is shared by District
            Judges Elmo B. Hunter, D. Brook Bartlett, and Dean Whipple of the Western District. Id.,
            at 1033, n. 1. Chief District Judge Scott O. Wright wrote in dissent. Id., at 1035.</p>
         <p>[3] The corresponding Report in the House of Representatives was filed a year later. See
            H. R. Rep. No. 98-1017 (1984). The House bill (H. R. 6012, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. (1984))
            eventually was set aside in favor of the Senate bill. The House Report, however, reveals
            that the Senate's rationale underlying sentencing reform was shared in the House.</p>
         <p>[4] Until the Parole Commission ceases to exist in 1992, as provided by §§ 218(a)(5) and
            235(a)(1) of the Act, 98 Stat. 2027 and 2031, the Chairman of that Commission serves as
            an ex officio nonvoting member of the Sentencing Commission. § 235(b)(5), 98 Stat.

         <p>[5] Petitioner's claims were identical to those raised by defendants in other cases in
            the Western District of Missouri. Argument on petitioner's motion was presented to a
            panel of sentencing judges. The result is described in n. 2, supra.</p>
         <p>[6] The disarray is revealed by the District Court decisions cited in the petition for
            certiorari in No. 87-1904, pp. 9-10, nn. 10 and 11. Since certiorari was granted, a
            panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, by a divided vote,
            has invalidated the Guidelines on separation-of-powers grounds, Gubiensio-Ortiz v.
            Kanahele, 857 F. 2d 1245 (1988), cert. pending sub nom. United States v. Chavez-Sanchez,
            No. 88-550, and a panel of the Third Circuit (one judge, in dissent, did not reach the
            constitutional issue) has upheld them, United States v. Frank, 864 F. 2d 992 (1988).</p>
         <p>[7] In Schechter and Panama Refining the Court concluded that Congress had failed to
            articulate any policy or standard that would serve to confine the discretion of the
            authorities to whom Congress had delegated power. No delegation of the kind at issue in
            those cases is present here. The Act does not make crimes of acts never before
            criminalized, see Fahey v. Mallonee, 332 U. S. 245, 249 (1947) (analyzing Panama
            Refining), or delegate regulatory power to private individuals, see Yakus v. United
            States, 321 U. S. 414, 424 (1944) (analyzing Schechter). In recent years, our
            application of the nondelegation doctrine principally has been limited to the
            interpretation of statutory texts, and, more particularly, to giving narrow
            constructions to statutory delegations that might otherwise be thought to be
            unconstitutional. See, e. g., Industrial Union Dept. v. American Petroleum Institute,
            448 U. S. 607, 646 (1980); National Cable Television Assn. v. United States, 415 U. S.
            336, 342 (1974).</p>
         <p>[8] Congress mandated that the guidelines include: </p>
         <p>"(A) a determination whether to impose a sentence to probation, a fine, or a term of
            imprisonment;</p>
         <p>"(B) a determination as to the appropriate amount of a fine or the appropriate length of
            a term of probation or a term of imprisonment;</p>
         <p>"(C) a determination whether a sentence to a term of imprisonment should include a
            requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after
            imprisonment, and, if so, the appropriate length of such a term; and</p>
         <p>"(D) a determination whether multiple sentences to terms of imprisonment should be
            ordered to run concurrently or consecutively." 28 U. S. C. § 994(a)(1).</p>
         <p>[9] The Senate Report on the legislation elaborated on the purpose to be served by each
            factor. The Report noted, for example, that the reference to the community view of the
            gravity of an offense was "not intended to mean that a sentence might be enhanced
            because of public outcry about a single offense," but "to suggest that changed community
            norms concerning certain particular criminal behavior might be justification for
            increasing or decreasing the recommended penalties for the offense." Report, at 170. The
            Report, moreover, gave specific examples of areas in which prevailing sentences might be
            too lenient, including the treatment of major white-collar criminals. Id., at 177.</p>
         <p>[10] Again, the legislative history provides additional guidance for the Commission's
            consideration of the statutory factors. For example, the history indicates Congress'
            intent that the "criminal history . . . factor includes not only the number of prior
            criminal acts &#x97; whether or not they resulted in convictions &#x97; the defendant
            has engaged in, but their seriousness, their recentness or remoteness, and their
            indication whether the defendant is a `career criminal' or a manager of a criminal
            enterprise." Id., at 174. This legislative history, together with Congress' directive
            that the Commission begin its consideration of the sentencing ranges by ascertaining the
            average sentence imposed in each category in the past, and Congress' explicit
            requirement that the Commission consult with authorities in the field of criminal
            sentencing provide a factual background and statutory context that give content to the
            mandate of the Commission. See American Power &amp;amp; Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U. S. 90,
            104-105 (1946).</p>
         <p>[11] Petitioner argues that the excessive breadth of Congress' delegation to the
            Commission is particularly apparent in the Commission's considering whether to
            "reinstate" the death penalty for some or all of those crimes for which capital
            punishment is still authorized in the Federal Criminal Code. See Brief for Petitioner
            51-52. Whether, in fact, the Act confers upon the Commission the power to develop
            guidelines and procedures to bring current death penalty provisions into line with
            decisions of this Court is a matter of intense debate between the Executive Branch and
            some members of Congress, including the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. See
            Gubiensio-Ortiz v. Kanahele, 857 F. 2d, at 1256. We assume, without deciding, that the
            Commission was assigned the power to effectuate the death penalty provisions of the
            Criminal Code. That the Commission may have this authority (but has not exercised it)
            does not affect our analysis. Congress did not authorize the Commission to enact a
            federal death penalty for any offense. As for every other offense within the
            Commission's jurisdiction, the Commission could include the death penalty within the
            guidelines only if that punishment was authorized in the first instance by Congress and
            only if such inclusion comported with the substantial guidance Congress gave the
            Commission in fulfilling its assignments. JUSTICE BRENNAN does not join this
            footnote.</p>
         <p>[12] Madison admonished: "In republican government the legislative authority,
            necessarily, predominates." The <ref type="intent" num="51">Federalist</ref> No. 51, p. 350 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).</p>
         <p>[13] If the potential for disruption is present, we then determine "whether that impact
            is justified by an overriding need to promote objectives within the constitutional
            authority of Congress." Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S., at
            443.</p>
         <p>[14] Our recent cases cast no doubt on the continuing vitality of the view that
            rulemaking is not a function exclusively committed to the Executive Branch. Although in
            INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919 (1983), we characterized rulemaking as "Executive action"
            not governed by the Presentment Clauses, we did so as part of our effort to distinguish
            the rulemaking of administrative agencies from "lawmaking" by Congress which is subject
            to the presentment requirements of Article I. Id., at 953, n. 16. Plainly, this
            reference to rulemaking as an executive function was not intended to undermine our
            recognition in previous cases and in over 150 years of practice that rulemaking pursuant
            to a legislative delegation is not the exclusive prerogative of the Executive. See, e.
            g., Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 138 (1976) (distinguishing between Federal Election
            Commission's exclusively executive enforcement power and its other powers, including
            rulemaking); see also Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U. S. 602, 617 (1935).
            On the contrary, rulemaking power originates in the Legislative Branch and becomes an
            executive function only when delegated by the Legislature to the Executive Branch. </p>
         <p>More generally, it hardly can be argued in this case that Congress has impaired the
            functioning of the Executive Branch. In the field of sentencing, the Executive Branch
            never has exercised the kind of authority that Congress has vested in the Commission.
            Moreover, since Congress has empowered the President to appoint and remove Commission
            members, the President's relationship to the Commission is functionally no different
            from what it would have been had Congress not located the Commission in the Judicial
            Branch. Indeed, since the Act grants ex officio membership on the Commission to the
            Attorney General or his designee, 28 U. S. C. § 991(a), the Executive Branch's
            involvement in the Commission is greater than in other independent agencies, such as the
            Securities and Exchange Commission, not located in the Judicial Branch.</p>
         <p>[15] The Judicial Conference of the United States is charged with "promot[ing]
            uniformity of management procedures and the expeditious conduct of court business," in
            part by "a continuous study of the operation and effect of the general rules of practice
            and procedure," and recommending changes "to promote simplicity in procedure, fairness
            in administration, the just determination of litigation, and the elimination of
            unjustifiable expense and delay." 28 U. S. C. § 331 (1982 ed. and Supp. IV). Similarly,
            the Administrative Office of the United States Courts handles the administrative and
            personnel matters of the courts, matters essential to the effective and efficient
            operation of the judicial system. § 604 (1982 ed. and Supp. IV). Congress also has
            established the Federal Judicial Center which studies improvements in judicial
            administration. §§ 620-628 (1982 ed. and Supp. IV).</p>
         <p>[16] We also have upheld Congress' power under the Appointments Clause to vest
            appointment power in the Judicial Branch, concluding that the power of appointment,
            though not judicial, was not "inconsistent as a functional matter with the courts'
            exercise of their Article III powers." Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654, 679, n. 16
            (1988). See also Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371 (1880) (appointment power not
            incongruous to Judiciary). In Morrison, we noted that Article III courts perform a
            variety of functions not necessarily or directly connected to adversarial proceedings in
            a trial or appellate court. Federal courts supervise grand juries and compel the
            testimony of witnesses before those juries, see Brown v. United States, 359 U. S. 41, 49
            (1959), participate in the issuance of search warrants, see Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 41,
            and review wiretap applications, see 18 U. S. C. §§ 2516, 2518 (1982 ed. and Supp. IV).
            In the interest of effectuating their judgments, federal courts also possess inherent
            authority to initiate a contempt proceeding and to appoint a private attorney to
            prosecute the contempt. Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A., 481 U. S.
            787 (1987). See also In re Certain Complaints Under Investigation, 783 F. 2d 1488, 1505
            (CA11) (upholding statute authorizing judicial council to investigate improper conduct
            by federal judge), cert. denied sub nom. Hastings v. Godbold, 477 U. S. 904 (1986).</p>
         <p>[17] Indeed, had Congress decided to confer responsibility for promulgating sentencing
            guidelines on the Executive Branch, we might face the constitutional questions whether
            Congress unconstitutionally had assigned judicial responsibilities to the Executive or
            unconstitutionally had united the power to prosecute and the power to sentence within
            one Branch. Ronald L. Gainer, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Department of
            Justice, testified before the Senate to this very effect: "If guidelines were to be
            promulgated by an agency outside the judicial branch, it might be viewed as an
            encroachment on a judicial function . . . ." Reform of the Federal Criminal Laws,
            Hearing on S. 1437 et al. before the Subcommittee on Criminal Laws and Procedures of the
            Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 13, p. 9005 (1977).</p>
         <p>[18] Under its mandate, the Commission must make judgments about the relative importance
            of such considerations as the "circumstances under which the offense was committed," the
            "community view of the gravity of the offense," and the "deterrent effect a particular
            sentence may have on the commission of the offense by others." 28 U. S. C. §§ 994(c)(2),
            (4), (6).</p>
         <p>[19] Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for example, has inspired a
            controversy over the philosophical, social, and economic merits and demerits of class
            actions. See Miller, Of Frankenstein Monsters and Shining Knights: Myth, Reality, and
            the "Class Action Problem," 92 Harv. L. Rev. 664 (1979).</p>
         <p>[20] We express no opinion about whether, under the principles of separation of powers,
            Congress may confer on a court rulemaking authority such as that exercised by the
            Sentencing Commission. Our precedents and customs draw no clear distinction between
            nonadjudicatory activity that may be undertaken by auxiliary bodies within the Judicial
            Branch, but not by courts. We note, however, that the constitutional calculus is
            different for considering nonadjudicatory activities performed by bodies that exercise
            judicial power and enjoy the constitutionally mandated autonomy of courts from what it
            is for considering the nonadjudicatory activities of independent nonadjudicatory
            agencies that Congress merely has located within the Judicial Branch pursuant to its
            powers under the Necessary and Proper Clause. We make no attempt here to define the
            nonadjudicatory duties that are appropriate for auxiliary bodies within the Judicial
            Branch, but not for courts. Nonetheless, it is clear to us that an independent agency
            located within the Judicial Branch may undertake without constitutional consequences
            policy judgments pursuant to a legitimate congressional delegation of authority that, if
            undertaken by a court, might be incongruous to or destructive of the central
            adjudicatory mission of the Branch. See United States v. Ferreira, <span
               class="citation">

               </a>
            </span> (1852). In this sense, the issue we face here is different from the issue we
            faced in Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988), where we considered the
            constitutionality of the nonadjudicatory functions assigned to the "Special Division"
            court created by the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 28 U. S. C. §§ 49, 591 et seq.
            (1982 ed. and Supp. IV), or the issue we faced in Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792),
            and in Ferreira, in which Article III courts were asked to render judgments that were
            reviewable by an executive officer.</p>
         <p>[21] One such prohibition appeared in the New Jersey Plan's judiciary provision, see 1
            M. Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 244 (1911); the other,
            proposed by Charles Pinckney, a delegate from South Carolina, was not reported out of
            the Committee on Detail to which he submitted it, see 2 id., at 341-342. See also
            Wheeler, Extrajudicial Activities of the Early Supreme Court, 1973 S. Ct. Rev. 123.
            Concededly, it is also true that the delegates at the Convention rejected two proposals
            that would have institutionalized extrajudicial service. Despite support from Madison,
            the Framers rejected a proposed "Council of Revision," comprised of, among others, a
            "convenient number of the National Judiciary," 1 Farrand, supra, at 21, that would have
            exercised veto power over proposed legislation. Similarly, the Framers rejected a
            proposed "Council of State," of which the Chief Justice was to be a member, that would
            have acted as adviser to the President in a fashion similar to the modern cabinet. See
            Lerner, The Supreme Court as Republican Schoolmaster, 1967 S. Ct. Rev. 127, 174-177. At
            least one commentator has observed that a number of the opponents of the Council of
            Revision and the Council of State believed that judges individually could assume
            extrajudicial service. Wheeler, supra, at 127-130. We do not pretend to discern a clear
            intent on the part of the Framers with respect to this issue, but glean from the
            Constitution and the events at the Convention simply an inference that the Framers did
            not intend to forbid judges to hold extrajudicial positions. See United States v. Nixon,
            418 U. S. 683, 705-706, n. 16 (1974).</p>
         <p>[22] It would be naive history, however, to suggest that the Framers, including the
            Justices who accepted extrajudicial service, were of one mind on the issue or believed
            that such service was in all cases appropriate and constitutional. Chief Justice Jay, in
            draft correspondence to President Washington, explained that he was "far from thinking
            it illegal or unconstitutional," for the Executive to use individual judges for
            extrajudicial service so long as the extrajudicial service was "consistent and
            compatible" with "the judicial function." Draft of a letter by Jay, intended for
            President Washington, enclosed with a letter dated September 15, 1790, from Jay to
            Justice Iredell, reproduced in 2 G. McRee, Life and Correspondence of James Iredell 293,
            294 (1949). Chief Justice Marshall stepped down from his post as Secretary of State when
            appointed to the bench, agreeing to stay on only until a replacement could be found.
            Chief Justice Ellsworth accepted his posting to France with reluctance and his
            appointment was unsuccessfully opposed on constitutional grounds by Jefferson, Madison,
            and Pinckney. But that some judges have turned down extrajudicial service or have
            expressed reservations about the practice, see Mason, Extra-Judicial Work for Judges:
            The Views of Chief Justice Stone, 67 Harv. L. Rev. 193 (1953), does not detract from the
            fact that judges have continued to assume extrajudicial duties, and efforts to curb the
            practice as contrary to the letter or spirit of the Constitution have not succeeded. But
            see Note, The Constitutional Infirmities of the United States Sentencing Commission, 96

         <p>[23] Compendia of extrajudicial activities may be found in several sources. See Mason,
            supra; McKay, The Judiciary and Nonjudicial Activities, 35 Law &amp;amp; Contemp. Prob.
            9 (1970); Slonim, Extrajudicial Activities and the Principle of the Separation of
            Powers, 49 Conn. B. J. 391 (1975). See also In re President's Comm'n on Organized Crime,
            783 F. 2d 370 (CA3 1986).</p>
         <p>[24] Article III judges, and the Chief Justice in particular, also have served and
            continue to serve on numerous cultural commissions. The Chief Justice by statute is a
            member of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, Rev. Stat. § 5580, as
            amended, 20 U. S. C. § 42, and a trustee of the National Gallery of Art, 50 Stat. 52, 20
            U. S. C. § 72(a). Four Justices, pursuant to 44 U. S. C. § 2501, have served
            successively as the judiciary member of the National Historical Publications and Records
            Commission. And Chief Justice Burger began his service as Chairman of the Commission on
            the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution before he assumed retirement status.
            See Pub. L. 98-101, 97 Stat. 719.</p>
         <p>[25] For example, Judges A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., James B. Parsons, Luther W.
            Youngdahl, George C. Edwards, Jr., James M. Carter, and Thomas J. MacBride, and others,
            have served on various Presidential and national commissions. See Brief for United
            States 48, n. 40.</p>
         <p>[26] Extrajudicial activity has been the subject of extensive testimony in Congress from
            federal judges, academics, legislators, and members of the legal community. See
            Nonjudicial Activities of Supreme Court Justices and other Federal Judges, Hearings
            before the Subcommittee on Separation of Powers of the Senate Committee on the
            Judiciary, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (1969). Although many participants were critical of
            extrajudicial service, the testimony shed little light on what types of service were not
            merely unwise, but unconstitutional. </p>
         <p>Perhaps the most interesting lament on the subject comes from Chief Justice Warren
            reflecting on his initial refusal to participate in the commission looking into
            President Kennedy's death:</p>
         <p>"First, it is not in the spirit of constitutional separation of powers to have a member
            of the Supreme Court serve on a presidential commission; second, it would distract a
            Justice from the work of the Court, which had a heavy docket; and, third, it was
            impossible to foresee what litigation such a commission might spawn, with resulting
            disqualification of the Justice from sitting in such cases. I then told them that,
            historically, the acceptance of diplomatic posts by Chief Justices Jay and Ellsworth had
            not contributed to the welfare of the Court, that the service of five Justices on the
            Hayes-Tilden Commission had demeaned it, that the appointment of Justice Roberts as
            chairman to investigate the Pearl Harbor disaster had served no good purpose, and that
            the action of Justice Robert Jackson in leaving Court for a year to become chief
            prosecutor at Nurnberg after World War II had resulted in divisiveness and internal
            bitterness on the Court." E. Warren, The Memoirs of Earl Warren 356 (1977).</p>
         <p>Despite his initial reservations, the Chief Justice served as Chairman of the commission
            and endured criticism for so doing.</p>
         <p>[27] The effect of extrajudicial service on the functioning of the Judicial Branch is
            not solely a constitutional concern. The Code of Conduct for United States Judges,
            approved by the Judicial Conference of the United States, is intended to ensure that a
            judge does not accept extrajudicial service incompatible with the performance of
            judicial duties or that might compromise the integrity of the Branch as a whole. Canon
            5(G) provides: </p>
         <p>"A judge should not accept appointment to a governmental committee, commission, or other
            position that is concerned with issues of fact or policy on matters other than the
            improvement of the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice, unless
            appointment of a judge is required by Act of Congress. A judge should not, in any event,
            accept such an appointment if the judge's governmental duties would interfere with the
            performance of judicial duties or tend to undermine the public confidence in the
            integrity, impartiality, or independence of the judiciary . . . ." Administrative Office
            of U. S. Courts, Code of Judicial Conduct for United States Judges (1987).</p>
         <p>[28] Certainly nothing in the Act creates any coercive power over members of the
            Judicial Branch and we construe the statute as affording none. "[I]t is the duty of
            federal courts to construe a statute in order to save it from constitutional
            infirmities, see, e. g., Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833, 841
            (1986)." Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S., at 682.</p>
         <p>[29] Notably, the statutory provision creating the Judicial Councils of the Circuits
            that we found constitutionally unobjectionable in Chandler requires the Chief Judge of
            each Court of Appeals to preside over his Circuit's Judicial Council. 28 U. S. C. § 332.
            The statutory provision creating the Judicial Conference of the United States also
            requires the service of the Chief Judge of each Court of Appeals. 28 U. S. C. § 331
            (1982 ed. and Supp. IV). Thus, we have given at least tacit approval to this degree of
            congressionally mandated judicial service on nonadjudicatory bodies.</p>
         <p>[30] Petitioner does not raise the issue central to our most recent opinions discussing
            removal power, namely, whether Congress unconstitutionally has limited the President's
            authority to remove officials engaged in executive functions or has reserved for itself
            excessive removal power over such officials. See Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654
            (1988); Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714 (1986).</p>
         <p>[31] Moreover, as has been noted, the Act limits the President's power to use his
            appointments to the Commission for political purposes by explicitly requiring that he
            consider a list of six judges submitted by the Judicial Conference before making his
            selections. Senator Hart explained that this provision provided "greater assurance that
            a broad range of interests will be represented." 124 Cong. Rec. 378 (1978).</p>
         <p>[32] The textual requirements of Article III that judges shall enjoy tenure and be paid
            an irreducible compensation "were incorporated into the Constitution to ensure the
            independence of the Judiciary from control of the Executive and Legislative Branches of
            government." Northern Pipeline Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 59 (1982).
            These inviolable guarantees are untrammeled by the Act. Concededly, since Commission
            members receive a salary equal to that of a court of appeals judge, 28 U. S. C. §
            992(c), district court judges appointed to the Commission receive an increase in salary.
            We do not address the hypothetical constitutional question whether, under the
            Compensation Clause of Article III, a district judge removed from the Commission must
            continue to be paid the higher salary.</p>
         <p>[33] This removal provision is precisely the kind that was at issue in Humphrey's
            Executor v. United States where we wrote: "The authority of Congress, in creating
            quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial agencies, to require them to act in discharge of
            their duties independently of executive control cannot well be doubted; and that
            authority includes, as an appropriate incident, power to fix the period during which
            [commissioners] shall continue in office, and to forbid their removal except for cause
            in the meantime." 295 U. S., at 629.</p>
         <p>[34] Although removal from the Sentencing Commission conceivably could involve some
            embarrassment or even damage to reputation, each judge made potentially subject to these
            injuries will have undertaken the risk voluntarily by accepting the President's
            appointment to serve.</p>
         <p>[35] Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714 (1986), is not to the contrary. In Bowsher, we held
            that "Congress cannot reserve for itself the power of removal of an officer charged with
            the execution of the laws except by impeachment." Id., at 726. To permit Congress to
            remove an officer performing executive functions whenever Congress might find the
            performance of his duties unsatisfactory would, in essence, give Congress veto power
            over executive action. In light of the special danger recognized by the Founders of
            congressional usurpation of Executive Branch functions, "[t]his kind of congressional
            control over the execution of the laws . . . is constitutionally impermissible." Id., at
            726-727. </p>
         <p>Nothing in Bowsher, however, suggests that one Branch may never exercise removal power,
            however limited, over members of another Branch. Indeed, we already have recognized that
            the President may remove a judge who serves on an Article I court. McAllister v. United
            States, 141 U. S. 174, 185 (1891). In any event, we hold here no more than that Congress
            may vest in the President the power to remove for good cause an Article III judge from a
            nonadjudicatory independent agency placed within the Judicial Branch. Because an Article
            III judge serving on a nonadjudicatory commission is not exercising judicial power, and
            because such limited removal power gives the President no control over judicatory
            functions, interbranch removal authority under these limited circumstances poses no
            threat to the balance of power among the Branches. Our paramount concern in Bowsher that
            Congress was accreting to itself the power to control the functions of another Branch is
            not implicated by a removal provision, like the one at issue here, which provides no
            control in one Branch over the constitutionally assigned mission of another Branch.</p>
         <p>[1] It is even arguable that the Commission has authority to establish guidelines and
            procedures for imposing the death penalty, thus reinstituting that sanction under
            federal statutes for which (by reason of our recent decisions) it has been thought
            unusable because of constitutionally inadequate procedures. The Justice Department
            believes such authority exists, and has encouraged the Commission to exercise it. See
            Gubiensio-Ortiz v. Kanahele, 857 F. 2d 1245, 1256 (CA9 1988).</p>
         <p>[2] An executive agency can, of course, be created with no power other than the making
            of rules, as long as that agency is subject to the control of the President and the
            President has executive authority related to the rulemaking. In such circumstances, the
            rulemaking is ultimately ancillary to the President's executive powers.</p>
         <p>[3] There are of course agencies within the Judicial Branch (because they operate under
            the control of courts or judges) which are not themselves courts, see, e. g., 28 U. S.
            C. § 601 et seq. (Administrative Office of the United States Courts), just as there are
            agencies within the Legislative Branch (because they operate under the control of
            Congress) which are not themselves Senators or Representatives, see, e. g., 31 U. S. C.
            § 701 et seq. (General Accounting Office). But these agencies, unlike the Sentencing
            Commission, exercise no governmental powers, that is, they establish and determine
            neither private rights nor the prerogatives of the other Branches. They merely assist
            the courts and the Congress in their exercise of judicial and legislative powers.</p>
