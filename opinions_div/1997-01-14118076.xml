         </p>
         <p>Justice Breyer, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
         <p>The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) sued several officers and directors of City
            Federal Savings Bank, claiming that they had violated the legal standard of care they
            owed that federally chartered, federally insured institution. The case here focuses upon
            the legal standard for determining whether or not their behavior was improper. It asks
            where courts should look to find the standard of care to measure the legal propriety of
            the defendants' conduct&#x97;to state law, <span class="star-pagination">*216</span> to
            federal common law, or to a special federal statute (103 Stat. 243, 12 U. S. C. §
            1821(k)) that speaks of "gross negligence"?</p>
         <p>We conclude that state law sets the standard of conduct as long as the state standard
            (such as simple negligence) is stricter than that of the federal statute. The federal
            statute nonetheless sets a "gross negligence" floor, which applies as a substitute for
            state standards that are more relaxed.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>In 1989, City Federal Savings Bank (City Federal), a federal savings association, went
            into receivership. The RTC, as receiver, brought this action in the bank's name against
            officers and directors. (Throughout this opinion, we use the more colloquial term "bank"
            to refer to a variety of institutions such as "federal savings associations.") The
            complaint said that the defendants had acted (or failed to act) in ways that led City
            Federal to make various bad development, construction, and business acquisition loans.
            It claimed that these actions (or omissions) were unlawful because they amounted to
            gross negligence, simple negligence, and breaches of fiduciary duty.</p>
         <p>The defendants moved to dismiss. They pointed to a federal statute, 12 U. S. C. §
            1821(k), that says in part that a "director or officer" of a federally insured bank "may
            be held personally liable for monetary damages" in an RTC-initiated "civil action . . .
            for gross negligence " or "similar conduct . . . that demonstrates a greater disregard
            of a duty of care (than gross negligence) .. . ." (Emphasis added.) They argued that, by
            authorizing actions for gross negligence or more seriously culpable conduct, the statute
            intended to forbid actions based upon less seriously culpable conduct, such as conduct
            that rose only to the level of simple negligence. The District Court agreed and
            dismissed all but the gross negligence claims.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*217</span> The Third Circuit, providing an interlocutory
            appeal, 28 U. S. C. § 1292(b), reversed. It interpreted the federal statute as simply
            offering a safeguard against state legislation that had watered down applicable state
            standards of care&#x97; below a gross negligence benchmark. As so interpreted, the
            statute did not prohibit actions resting upon stricter standard of care
            rules&#x97;whether those stricter standard of care rules originated in state law (which
            the Circuit found applicable in the case of state-chartered banks) or in federal common
            law (which the Circuit found applicable in the case of federally chartered banks).
            Resolution Trust Corp. v. Cityfed Financial Corp., 57 F. 3d 1231, 1243-1244, 1245-1249
            (1995). Noting that City Federal is a federally chartered savings institution, the
            Circuit concluded that the RTC was free "to pursue any claims for negligence or breach
            of fiduciary duty available as a matter of federal common law." Id., at 1249.</p>
         <p>The defendants, pointing to variations in the Circuits' interpretations of the "gross
            negligence" statute, sought certiorari. Compare Resolution Trust Corp. v. Frates, 52 F.
            3d 295 (CA10 1995) (§ 1821(k) prohibits federal common-law actions for simple
            negligence), with Cityfed, supra, at 1246&#x97; 1249 (§ 1821(k) does not prohibit
            federal common-law actions for simple negligence). And we granted review.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>We begin by temporarily setting the federal "gross negligence" statute to the side, and
            by asking whether, were there no such statute, federal common law would provide the
            applicable legal standard. We recognize, as did the Third Circuit, that this Court did
            once articulate federal commonlaw corporate governance standards, applicable to
            federally chartered banks. Briggs v. Spaulding, 141 U. S. 132 (1891). See also Martin v.
            Webb, 110 U. S. 7, 15 (1884) (directors must "use ordinary diligence . . . and . . .
            exercise reasonable <span class="star-pagination">*218</span> control"); Bowerman v.
            Hamner, 250 U. S. 504 (1919). But the Court found its rules of decision in federal
            common law long before it held, in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938), that
            "[t]here is no federal general common law." Id., at 78. The Third Circuit, while
            considering itself bound by Briggs, asked whether relevant federal common-law standards
            could have survived Erie. We conclude that they did not and that (except as modified in
            Part III, infra ) state law, not federal common law, provides the applicable rules for
            decision.</p>
         <p>This Court has recently discussed what one might call "federal common law" in the
            strictest sense, i. e., a rule of decision that amounts, not simply to an interpretation
            of a federal statute or a properly promulgated administrative rule, but, rather, to the
            judicial "creation" of a special federal rule of decision. See Texas Industries, Inc. v.
            Radcliff Materials, Inc. , 451 U. S. 630, 640-643 (1981). The Court has said that "cases
            in which judicial creation of a special federal rule would be justified . . . are . . .
            `few and restricted.' " O'Melveny &amp;amp; Myers v. FDIC, 512 U. S. 79, 87 (1994)
            (quoting Wheeldin v. Wheeler, 373 U. S. 647, 651 (1963)). "Whether latent federal power
            should be exercised to displace state law is primarily a decision for Congress," not the
            federal courts. Wallis v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., 384 U. S. 63, 68 (1966). Nor
            does the existence of related federal statutes automatically show that Congress intended
            courts to create federal common-law rules, for "`Congress acts . . . against the
            background of the total corpus juris of the states. . . .' " Id., at 68 (quoting H. Hart
            &amp;amp; H. Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System 435 (1953)). Thus,
            normally, when courts decide to fashion rules of federal common law, "the guiding
            principle is that a significant conflict between some federal policy or interest and the
            use of state law . . . must first be specifically shown." 384 U. S., at 68. Indeed, such
            a "conflict" is normally a "precondition." O'Melveny, supra, at 87. See also United
            States v. Kimbell <span class="star-pagination">*219</span> Foods, Inc., 440 U. S. 715,
            728 (1979); Kamen v. Kemper Financial Services, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 98 (1991).</p>
         <p>No one doubts the power of Congress to legislate rules for deciding cases like the one
            before us. Indeed, Congress has enacted related legislation. Certain federal statutes
            specify, for example, how to form "national banks" (i. e., a federally chartered bank),
            how to amend the articles of association, how shareholders are to vote, directors'
            qualifications, the form of a bank's "organization certificate," minimum capital
            requirements, and a list of corporate powers. See 12 U. S. C. § 21 et seq. Other federal
            statutes regulate the activities of federally chartered savings associations in various
            ways. E. g., 12 U. S. C. § 1464(b) (various regulations on savings associations, such as
            interest rate on loans). No one argues, however, that either these statutes, or federal
            regulations validly promulgated pursuant to statute, set forth general corporate
            governance standards of the sort at issue applicable to a federally chartered savings
            association such as City Federal. Cf. 61 Fed. Reg. 4866 (1996) (to be codified in 12 CFR
            § 7.2000) (discussed infra, at 224) (describing governance procedures applicable to
            federally chartered national banks, but not federal savings associations). Consequently,
            we must decide whether the application of state-law standards of care to such banks
            would conflict with, and thereby significantly threaten, a federal policy or
            interest.</p>
         <p>We have examined each of the basic arguments that the respondent implicitly or
            explicitly raises. In our view, they do not point to a conflict or threat that is
            significant, and we shall explain why. (The respondent, by the way, is now the Federal
            Deposit Insurance Corporation&#x97;the FDIC&#x97;which has replaced the RTC pursuant to
            a new federal statute. 12 U. S. C. § 1441a(b)(4)(A).)</p>
         <p>First, the FDIC invokes the need for "uniformity." Federal common law, it says, will
            provide uniformity, but "[s]uperimposing state standards of fiduciary responsibility
            over standards developed by a federal chartering authority would <span
               class="star-pagination">*220</span>. . . `upset the balance' that the federal
            chartering authority `may strike . . . .' " Brief for Respondent 23 (quoting Kamen,
            supra, at 103). To invoke the concept of "uniformity," however, is not to prove its
            need. Cf. Kimbell Foods, supra, at 730 (rejecting "generalized pleas for uniformity");
            O'Melveny, supra, at 88 (same).</p>
         <p>For one thing, the number of federally insured banks is about equally divided between
            federally chartered and state-chartered banks, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 1
            Statistics on Banking: A Statistical History of the United States Banking Industry, p.
            B-9 (Aug. 1995) (Table SI-9) (showing that, in 1989, there were 1,595 federally
            chartered institutions and 1,492 state-chartered ones); and a federal standard that
            increases uniformity among the former would increase disparity with the latter.</p>
         <p>For another, our Nation's banking system has thrived despite disparities in matters of
            corporate governance. Consider, for example, the divergent state-law governance
            standards applicable to banks chartered in different States, e. g., Ind. Code §
            23-1&#x97;35-1(e)(2) (1994) (directors not liable unless conduct constitutes at least
            "willful misconduct or recklessness"); Iowa Code § 524.605 (1995) (providing ordinary
            negligence standard), as well as the different ways in which lower courts since 1891
            have interpreted Briggs ` "federal common law" standard. Compare Federal Deposit
            Insurance Corporation v. Mason, 115 F. 2d 548, 551-552 (CA3 1940) (applying standard
            similar to simple negligence), with Washington Bancorporation v. Said, <span
               class="citation">
               <a href="/dcd/a2Be/washington-bancorporation-v-said/">

               </a>
            </span>, 1266 (DC 1993) (Briggs did not apply "simple negligence" standard of care). See
            R. Stevens &amp;amp; B. Nielson, The Standard of Care for Directors and Officers of
            Federally Chartered Depository Institutions: It's Gross Negligence Regardless of Whether
            Section 1821(k) Preempts Federal Common Law, 13 Ann. Review Banking L. 169, 172 (1994)
            (in part because of "widely varying results, the federal common law standard of care is
            neither fully developed, nor well settled"). See <span class="star-pagination"
               >*221</span> also infra, at 223 (citing cases in which state governance law has been
            applied to national banks). Indeed, the Comptroller of the Currency, acting through
            regulation, permits considerable disparity in the standard of care applicable to
            federally chartered banks other than savings banks (which are under the jurisdiction of
            the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), 12 U. S. C. §§ 1462a, 1463(a)). See 61 Fed. Reg.
            4866 (1996) (to be codified in 12 CFR § 7.2000) (permitting banks, within broad limits,
            "to follow the corporate governance procedures of the law of the state in which the main
            office of the bank is located . . . [or] the Delaware General Corporation Law . . . or
            the [Model Business Corporation Act]").</p>
         <p>Second, the FDIC at times suggests that courts must apply a federal common-law standard
            of care simply because the banks in question are federally chartered. This argument,
            with little more, might have seemed a strong one during most of the first century of our
            Nation's history, for then state-chartered banks were the norm and federally chartered
            banks an exception&#x97;and federal banks often encountered hostility and deleterious
            state laws. See B. Klebaner, American Commercial Banking: A History 4-11 (1990) (tracing
            the origin of the dual banking system to the 1780 Philadelphia Bank and discussing
            proposals of a then-young Alexander Hamilton); B. Hammond, Banks and Politics in
            America: From the Revolution to the Civil War 41-66 (1957) (describing the
            controversial, but successful, <ref type="" num="">Federalist</ref> proposals for the first and second federally
            chartered Bank of the United States).</p>
         <p>After President Madison helped to create the second Bank of the United States, for
            example, many States enacted laws that taxed the federal bank in an effort to weaken it.
            This Court held those taxes unconstitutional. McCulloch v. Maryland, <span

            </span>, 361 (1870). In National Bank the Court distinguished McCulloch by recalling
            that Maryland's taxes were "used . . . to destroy," and it added that federal banks</p>
         "are subject to the laws of the State, and are governed in their daily course of business
         far more by the laws of the State than of the nation. All their contracts are <span
            class="star-pagination">*223</span> governed and construed by State laws. Their
         acquisition and transfer of property, their right to collect their debts, and their
         liability to be sued for debts, are all based on State law. It is only when the State law
         incapacitates the banks from discharging their duties to the government that it becomes
         unconstitutional." 9 Wall., at 362. The Court subsequently found numerous state laws
         applicable to federally chartered banks. See, e. g., Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank, 161 U.
         S. 275, 290 (1896) ("Nothing, of course, in this opinion is intended to deny the operation
         of general and undiscriminating state laws on the contracts of national banks, so long as
         such laws do not conflict with the letter or the general objects and purposes of
         Congressional legislation"); First Nat. Bank in St. Louis v. Missouri, 263 U. S. 640, 656
         (1924) (national banks "are subject to the laws of a State in respect of their affairs
         unless such laws interfere with the purposes of their creation, tend to impair or destroy
         their efficiency as federal agencies or conflict with the paramount law of the United
         States"); Wichita Royalty Co. v. City Nat. Bank of Wichita Falls, 306 U. S. 103 (1939)
         (applying state law to tort claim by depositor against directors of a national bank);
         Anderson Nat. Bank v. Luckett, 321 U. S. 233, 248 (1944) ("[N]ational banks are subject to
         state laws, unless those laws infringe the national banking laws or impose an undue burden
         on the performance of the banks' functions"); California Fed. Sav. &amp;amp; Loan Assn. v.
         Guerra, 479 U. S. 272 (1987) (applying state employment discrimination law to federally
         chartered savings and loan association). <p>For present purposes, the consequence is the
            following: To point to a federal charter by itself shows no conflict, threat, or need
            for "federal common law." It does not answer the critical question.</p>
         <p>Third, the FDIC refers to a conflict of laws principle called the "internal affairs
            doctrine"&#x97;a doctrine that this Court has described as</p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*224</span> "a conflict of laws principle which recognizes
         that only one State should have the authority to regulate a corporation's internal
         affairs&#x97;matters peculiar to the relationships among or between the corporation and its
         current officers, directors, and shareholders&#x97;because otherwise a corporation could be
         faced with conflicting demands." Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U. S. 624, 645 (1982). States
         normally look to the State of a business' incorporation for the law that provides the
         relevant corporate governance general standard of care. Restatement (Second) Conflict of
         Laws § 309 (1971). And by analogy, it has been argued, courts should look to federal law to
         find the standard of care governing officers and directors of federally chartered banks.
         See Resolution Trust Corporation v. Chapman, 29 F. 3d 1120, 1123-1124 (CA7 1994). <p>To
            find a justification for federal common law in this argument, however, is to substitute
            analogy or formal symmetry for the controlling legal requirement, namely, the existence
            of a need to create federal common law arising out of a significant conflict or threat
            to a federal interest. O'Melveny, 512 U. S., at 85, 87. The internal affairs doctrine
            shows no such need, for it seeks only to avoid conflict by requiring that there be a
            single point of legal reference. Nothing in that doctrine suggests that the single
            source of law must be federal. See Chapman, supra, at 1126-1127 (Posner, C. J.,
            dissenting). In the absence of a governing federal common law, courts applying the
            internal affairs doctrine could find (we do not say that they will find) that the State
            closest analogically to the State of incorporation of an ordinary business is the State
            in which the federally chartered bank has its main office or maintains its principal
            place of business. Cf. 61 Fed. Reg. 4866 (1996) (to be codified in 12 CFR § 7.2000)
            (federally chartered commercial banks may "follow the corporate governance procedures of
            the law of the state in which the main office of the bank is located"). So to apply
            state law, <span class="star-pagination">*225</span> as we have said, would tend to
            avoid disparity between federally chartered and state-chartered banks (that might be
            next door to each other). And, of course, if this approach proved problematic, Congress
            and federal agencies acting pursuant to congressionally delegated authority remain free
            to provide to the contrary.</p>
         <p>Fourth, the FDIC points to statutes that provide the OTS, a federal regulatory agency,
            with authority to fine, or to remove from office, savings bank officers and directors
            for certain breaches of fiduciary duty. The FDIC adds that in "the course of such
            proceedings, the OTS, applying the ordinarycare standard [of Briggs, ] . . . has spoken
            authoritatively respecting the duty of care owed by directors and officers to federal
            savings associations." Brief for Respondent 23-25 (citations omitted). The FDIC does not
            claim, however, that these OTS statements, interpreting a pre-existing judgemade federal
            common-law standard (i. e., that of Briggs ) themselves amounted to an agency effort to
            promulgate a binding regulation pursuant to delegated congressional authority. Nor have
            we found, in our examination of the relevant OTS opinions, any convincing evidence of a
            relevant, significant conflict or threat to a federal interest.</p>
         <p>Finally, we note that here, as in O'Melveny, the FDIC is acting only as a receiver of a
            failed institution; it is not pursuing the interest of the Federal Government as a bank
            insurer&#x97;an interest likely present whether the insured institution is state, or
            federally, chartered.</p>
         <p>In sum, we can find no significant conflict with, or threat to, a federal interest. The
            federal need is far weaker than was present in what the Court has called the "`few and
            restricted' instances," Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, 313 (1981), in which this
            Court has created a federal common law. Consider, for example, Hinderlider v. La Plata
            River &amp;amp; Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U. S. 92 (1938) (controversy between two
            States regarding apportionment of streamwater); Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., 487
            U. S. 500 (1988) <span class="star-pagination">*226</span> (Federal Government
            contractors and civil liability of federal officials); United States v. Standard Oil Co.
            of Cal., 332 U. S. 301, 305 (1947) (relationship between Federal Government and members
            of its Armed Forces); Howard v. Lyons, 360 U. S. 593, 597 (1959) ( liability of federal
            officers in the course of official duty); Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U. S.
            398, 425 (1964) (relationships with other countries). See also Texas Industries, Inc. v.
            Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U. S. 630, 641 (1981) ("[A]bsent some congressional
            authorization to formulate substantive rules of decision, federal common law exists only
            in such narrow areas as those concerned with the rights and obligations of the United
            States, interstate and international disputes implicating the conflicting rights of
            States or our relations with foreign nations, and admiralty cases"). Indeed, the
            interests in many of the cases where this Court has declined to recognize federal common
            law appear at least as strong as, if not stronger than, those present here. E. g.,
            Wallis v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., 384 U. S. 63 (1966) (applying state law to
            claims for land owned and leased by the Federal Government); Kimbell Foods, 440 U. S.,
            at 726, 732-738 (applying state law to priority of liens under federal lending
            programs).</p>
         <p>We conclude that the federal common-law standards enunciated in cases such as Briggs did
            not survive this Court's later decision in Erie v. Tompkins. There is no federal common
            law that would create a general standard of care applicable to this case.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>We now turn to a further question: Does federal statutory law (namely, the federal
            "gross negligence" statute) supplant any state-law standard of care? The relevant parts
            of that statute read as follows:</p> "A director or officer of an insured depository
         institution may be held personally liable for monetary damages in any civil action by, on
         behalf of, or at the request or <span class="star-pagination">*227</span> direction of the
         Corporation . . . acting as conservator or receiver . . . for gross negligence, including
         any similar conduct or conduct that demonstrates a greater disre- gard of a duty of care
         (than gross negligence) including intentional tortious conduct, as such terms are defined
         and determined under applicable State law. Nothing in this paragraph shall impair or affect
         any right of the Corporation under other applicable law. " 12 U. S. C. § 1821(k) (emphasis
         added). <p>Lower courts have taken different positions about whether this statute, in
            stating that directors and officers "may be held personally liable" for conduct that
            amounts to "gross negligence" or worse, immunizes them from liability for conduct that
            is less culpable than gross negligence such as simple negligence. Federal Deposit

               <span class="reporter">F. Supp.</span>
               <span class="page">1244</span>
            </span> (Minn. 1991). See also Pet. for Cert. i ("The questions presented for review
            are: 1. Whether Section 1821(k) supplants `federal common law' and constitutes the
            exclusive standard of liability in a civil damage action brought by the Resolution Trust
            Corporation. . ."); Brief for American Bankers Association et al. as Amici Curiae
            7-8.</p>
         <p>In our view, the statute's "gross negligence" standard provides only a floor&#x97;a
            guarantee that officers and directors must meet at least a gross negligence standard. It
            does not stand in the way of a stricter standard that the laws of some States
            provide.</p>
         <p>For one thing, the language of the statute contains a saving clause that, read
            literally, preserves the applicability of stricter state standards. It says "[n]othing
            in this paragraph shall impair or affect any right of the Corporation under other
            applicable law." 12 U. S. C. § 1821(k) (emphasis <span class="star-pagination"
               >*228</span> added). The petitioner, in contending that the statute displaces federal
            common law, says that "any right" means only a right created elsewhere in the same Act
            of Congress, for example, by various regulatory enforcement provisions. E. g., § 1818(b)
            (cease-and-desist provision). But that is not what the Act says nor does its language
            compel so restrictive a reading. That language, read naturally, suggests an
            interpretation broad enough to save rights provided by other state, or federal, law.</p>
         <p>For another thing, Congress enacted the statute against a background of failing savings
            associations, see 135 Cong. Rec. 121 (1989) (statement of Rep. Roth); 135 Cong. Rec.
            1760 (1989) (statement of Sen. Graham), large federal payments to insured bank
            depositors, and recent changes in state law designed to limit pre-existing officer and
            director negligence liability. See, e. g., Fla. Stat. § 607.0831 (1993) ("recklessness
            or an act or omission . . . committed in bad faith or with malicious purpose"); Ohio
            Rev. Code Ann. § 1701.59(D) (1994) ("deliberate intent to cause injury to the
            corporation or undertaken with reckless disregard for the best interests of the
            corporation"). The state-law changes would have made it more difficult for the Federal
            Government to recover, from negligent officers and directors, federal funds spent to
            rescue failing savings banks and their depositors. And the background as a whole
            supports a reading of the statute as an effort to preserve the Federal Government's
            ability to recover funds by creating a standard of care floor.</p>
         <p>The legislative history, insofar as it is relevant, supports this conclusion. Members of
            Congress repeatedly referred to the harm that liability-relaxing changes in state law
            had caused the Federal Government, hence the taxpayer, as federal banking agencies tried
            to recover, from negligent officers and directors, some of the money that federal
            insurers had to pay to depositors in their failed banks. E. g., 135 Cong. Rec. 7150-7151
            (1989) (statement of Sen. Riegle) ("[T]he establishment of a Federal standard of care is
            based <span class="star-pagination">*229</span> on the overriding Federal interest in
            protecting the soundness of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation fund and is very
            limited in scope. It is not a wholesale preemption of longstanding principles of
            corporate governance . . ."). To have pre-empted state law with a uniform federal "gross
            negligence" standard would have cured the problem in some instances (where state law was
            weaker) but would have aggravated it in others (where state law was stronger).</p>
         <p>In fact, the legislative history says more. The relevant Senate Report addresses the
            point specifically. It says:</p> "This subsection does not prevent the FDIC from
         pursuing claims under State law or under other applicable Federal law, if such law permits
         the officers or directors of a financial institution to be sued (1) for violating a lower
         standard of care, such as simple negligence." S. Rep. No. 101-19, p. 318 (1989). <p>This
            Report was not published until two weeks after Congress enacted the law. But, as
            petitioner elsewhere concedes, the Report was circulated within Congress several weeks
            before Congress voted. In fact Senator Riegle, the Banking Committee Chairman, read the
            statement, on his own behalf and that of Senator Garn, six weeks before Congress voted
            on the law. 135 Cong. Rec. 12374 (1989). Contrast Clarke v. Securities Industry Assn.,
            479 U. S. 388, 407 (1987) (refusing to "attach substantial weight" to a Representative's
            statement made 10 days after the enactment of the law).</p>
         <p>The history is not all on one side. The Congressional Record contains one statement that
            suggests a competing congressional purpose, namely, to protect bank officers and
            directors from too strict a liability standard. 135 Cong. Rec. 7150 (1989) (statement of
            Sen. Sanford) (supporting "provisions relating to State laws affecting the liability of
            officers and directors of financial institutions" because "these changes are essential
            if we are to attract qualified officers <span class="star-pagination">*230</span> and
            directors to serve in our financial institutions"). But we have not found other such
            statements. And that statement is inconsistent with the language of the Senate Report.
            It suggests an interpretation of the statute largely rejected in the lower courts,
            namely, that it pre-empts stricter state law as applied to state-chartered, as well as
            to federally chartered, institutions. See, e. g., McSweeney, 976 F. 2d, at 540&#x97; 541
            (rejecting the interpretation as applied to statechartered banks); Canfield, 967 F. 2d,
            at 448-449 (same).</p>
         <p>The petitioner, in the courts below and as an alternative ground in this Court, made a
            final complicated argument to explain why 12 U. S. C. § 1821(k) displaces federal common
            law. He points to the universally conceded fact that the "gross negligence" statute
            applies to federal, as well as to state, banks. He then assumes, for sake of the
            argument, that in the absence of the statute, federal common law would determine
            liability for federal banks. He then asks why Congress would have applied the "gross
            negligence" statute to federal banks unless it wanted that statute to set an absolute
            standard, not a floor. After all, on the assumption that, without the statute, federal
            common law would hold federal directors and officers to a standard as strict, or
            stricter, there would have been no need for the statute unless (as applied to federal
            banks) it intended to set a universal standard, freeing officers and directors from the
            potentially less strict standard of the common law, and not what, given the assumptions,
            would be a totally unnecessary floor. This argument, taken to its logical conclusion,
            would also suggest that state standards of simple negligence would be displaced by the
            federal gross negligence statute.</p>
         <p>One obvious short answer to this ingenious argument lies in the fact that our conclusion
            in Part II runs contrary to the argument's critical assumption, namely, that federal
            common law sets the standard of liability applicable to federal banks. State law
            applies. Without that assumption, the need for a "gross negligence" floor in the case of
            federally chartered banks is identical to the need in the case of state-chartered <span
               class="star-pagination">*231</span> banks. In both instances, the floor is needed to
            limit state efforts to weaken liability standards; in both instances a floor serves that
            purpose; and the reasons for believing the statute only sets such a floor are equally
            strong.</p>
         <p>A more thorough answer lies in the fact that Congress nowhere separated its
            consideration of federally chartered, from that of state-chartered, banks. Congress did
            not ask whether one looked to federal common law or to state law to find the liability
            standard applicable to federally chartered banks. Nor did it try to determine the
            content of federal common law. One can reconcile congressional silence on the matter
            with a "gross negligence" statute, the language of which brings all banks (federal- and
            state-chartered) within its scope, simply by assuming that Congress, when enacting the
            statute, wanted to leave other law, including the law applicable to federally chartered
            banks, exactly where Congress found it. That, after all, is what the statute says. And
            the saving clause language taken at face value permits Congress to achieve its basic
            objective (providing a "gross negligence" floor) without having to unravel the arcane
            intricacies of federal common law. In our view, this understanding of congressional
            intent better explains the statute's language and history than the petitioner's
            interpretation, imputing to Congress an intent to apply a uniform "gross negligence"
            standard to federally chartered, but not state chartered, institutions.</p>
         <p>For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is
            remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
         <p>It is so ordered. </p></div>
      <div type="concurrence" judge="o'connor">
         <p> Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas join, concurring in part
            and concurring in the judgment. </p>
         <p>I join all of the Court's opinion, except to the extent that it relies on the notably
            unhelpful legislative history to 12 U. S. C. § 1821(k). Ante, at 228-230. As the Court
            correctly <span class="star-pagination">*232</span> points out, the most natural reading
            of the saving clause in § 1821(k) covers both state and federal rights. Ante, at 228.
            With such plain statutory language in hand, there is no reason to rely on legislative
            history that is, as the majority recognizes, "not all on one side." Ante, at 229.</p>
