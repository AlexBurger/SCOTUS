         </span> (1984) MASSACHUSETTS v. UPTON No. 83-1338. <p>Supreme Court of United States.</p>
         Decided May 14, 1984 ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT OF
         MASSACHUSETTS <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*728</span> PER CURIAM.</p>
         <p>Last Term, in Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213 (1983), we held that the Fourth
            Amendment's requirement of probable cause for the issuance of a warrant is to be
            applied, not according to a fixed and rigid formula, but rather in the light of the
            "totality of the circumstances" made known to the magistrate. We also emphasized that
            the task of a reviewing court is not to conduct a de novo determination of probable
            cause, but only to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record
            supporting the magistrate's decision to issue the warrant. In this case, the Supreme
            Judicial Court of Massachusetts, interpreting the probable-cause requirement of the
            Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, continued to rely on the approach
            set forth in cases such as Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U. S. 108 (1964), and Spinelli v.
            United States, 393 U. S. 410 (1969). <span class="citation">

            </span>, 458 N. E. 2d 717 (1983). Since this approach was rejected in Gates, we grant
            the petition for certiorari in this case and reverse the judgment of the Supreme
            Judicial Court.</p>
         <p>At noon on September 11, 1980, Lieutenant Beland of the Yarmouth Police Department
            assisted in the execution of a search warrant for a motel room reserved by one Richard
            Kelleher at the Snug Harbor Motel in West Yarmouth. The search produced several items of
            identification, including <span class="star-pagination">*729</span> credit cards,
            belonging to two persons whose homes had recently been burglarized. Other items taken in
            the burglaries, such as jewelry, silver, and gold, were not found at the motel.</p>
         <p>At 3:20 p. m. on the same day, Lieutenant Beland received a call from an unidentified
            female who told him that there was "a motor home full of stolen stuff" parked behind #5
            Jefferson Ave., the home of respondent George Upton and his mother. She stated that the
            stolen items included jewelry, silver, and gold. As set out in Lieutenant Beland's
            affidavit in support of a search warrant:</p> "She further stated that George Upton was
         going to move the motor home any time now because of the fact that Ricky Kelleher's motel
         room was raided and that George [Upton] had purchased these stolen items from Ricky
         Kelleher. This unidentified female stated that she had seen the stolen items but refused to
         identify herself because `he'll kill me,' referring to George Upton. I then told this
         unidentified female that I knew who she was, giving her the name of Lynn Alberico, who I
         had met on May 16, 1980, at George Upton's repair shop off Summer St., in Yarmouthport. She
         was identified to me by George Upton as being his girlfriend, Lynn Alberico. The
         unidentified female admitted that she was the girl that I had named, stating that she was
         surprised that I knew who she was. She then told me that she'd broken up with George Upton
         and wanted to burn him. She also told me that she wouldn't give me her address or phone
         number but that she would contact me in the future, if need be." See 390 Mass., at 564 n.
         2, 458 N. E. 2d, at 718, n. 2. <p>Following the phone call, Lieutenant Beland went to
            Upton's house to verify that a motor home was parked on the property. Then, while other
            officers watched the premises, Lieutenant Beland prepared the application for a search
            warrant, <span class="star-pagination">*730</span> setting out all the information noted
            above in an accompanying affidavit. He also attached the police reports on the two prior
            burglaries, along with lists of the stolen property. A Magistrate issued the warrant,
            and a subsequent search of the motor home produced the items described by the caller and
            other incriminating evidence. The discovered evidence led to Upton's conviction on
            multiple counts of burglary, receiving stolen property, and related crimes.</p>
         <p>On appeal to the Supreme Judicial Court, respondent argued that the search warrant was
            not supported by a sufficient showing of "probable cause" under the Fourth Amendment.
            With respect to our Gates opinion, that court said:</p> "It is not clear that the Gates
         opinion has announced a significant change in the appropriate Fourth Amendment treatment of
         applications for search warrants. Looking at what the Court did on the facts before it, and
         rejecting an expansive view of certain general statements not essential to the decision, we
         conclude that the Gates opinion deals principally with what corroboration of an informant's
         tip, not adequate by itself, will be sufficient to meet probable cause standards." 390
         Mass., at 568, 458 N. E. 2d, at 720. <p>Prior to Gates, the Fourth Amendment was understood
            by many courts to require strict satisfaction of a "two-pronged test" whenever an
            affidavit supporting the issuance of a search warrant relies on an informant's tip. It
            was thought that the affidavit, first, must establish the "basis of knowledge" of the
            informant &#x97; the particular means by which he came by the information given in his
            report; and, second, that it must provide facts establishing either the general
            "veracity" of the informant or the specific "reliability" of his report in the
            particular case. The Massachusetts court apparently viewed Gates as merely adding a new
            wrinkle to this two-pronged test: where an informant's veracity and/or basis of
            knowledge are not sufficiently clear, substantial corroboration of the tip may save an
            otherwise invalid warrant.</p>
         <span class="star-pagination">*731</span> "We do not view the Gates opinion as decreeing a
         standardless `totality of the circumstances' test. The informant's veracity and the basis
         of his knowledge are still important but, where the tip is adequately corroborated, they
         are not elements indispensible [sic] to a finding of probable cause. It seems that, in a
         given case, the corroboration may be so strong as to satisfy probable cause in the absence
         of any other showing of the informant's `veracity' and any direct statement of the `basis
         of [his] knowledge.' " 390 Mass., at 568, 458 N. E. 2d, at 721. <p>Turning to the facts of
            this case, the Massachusetts court reasoned, first, that the basis of the informant's
            knowledge was not "forcefully apparent" in the affidavit. Id., at 569, 458 N. E. 2d, at
            721. Although the caller stated that she had seen the stolen items and that they were in
            the motor home, she did not specifically state that she saw them in the motor home.
            Second, the court concluded that "[n]one of the common bases for determining the
            credibility of an informant or the reliability of her information is present here."
            Ibid. The caller was not a "tried and true" informant, her statement was not against
            penal interest, and she was not an "ordinary citizen" providing information as a witness
            to a crime. "She was an anonymous informant, and her unverified assent to the suggestion
            that she was Lynn Alberico does not take her out of that category." Id., at 570, 458 N.
            E. 2d, at 722.</p>
         <p>Finally, the court felt that there was insufficient corroboration of the informant's tip
            to make up for its failure to satisfy the two-pronged test. The facts that tended to
            corroborate the informant's story were that the motor home was where it was supposed to
            be, that the caller knew of the motel raid which took place only three hours earlier,
            and that the caller knew the name of Upton and his girlfriend. But, much as the Supreme
            Court of Illinois did in the opinion we reviewed in Gates, the Massachusetts court
            reasoned that each item of corroborative evidence either related to innocent,
            nonsuspicious conduct or related to an event that took place in <span
               class="star-pagination">*732</span> public. To sustain the warrant, the court
            concluded, more substantial corroboration was needed. The court therefore held that the
            warrant violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and reversed
            respondent's convictions.</p>
         <p>We think that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts misunderstood our decision in
            Gates. We did not merely refine or qualify the "two-pronged test." We rejected it as
            hypertechnical and divorced from "the factual and practical considerations of everday
            life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act." Brinegar v.
            United States, 338 U. S. 160, 175 (1949). Our statement on that score was explicit.
            "[W]e conclude that it is wiser to abandon the `two-pronged test' established by our
            decisions in Aguilar and Spinelli. In its place we reaffirm the
            totality-of-the-circumstances analysis that traditionally has informed probable-cause
            determinations." Gates, 462 U. S., at 238. This "totality-of-the-circumstances" analysis
            is more in keeping with the "practical, common-sense decision" demanded of the
            magistrate. Ibid.</p>
         <p>We noted in Gates that "the `two-pronged test' has encouraged an excessively technical
            dissection of informants' tips, with undue attention being focused on isolated issues
            that cannot sensibly be divorced from the other facts presented to the magistrate." Id.,
            at 234-235 (footnote omitted). This, we think, is the error of the Massachusetts court
            in this case. The court did not consider Lieutenant Beland's affidavit in its entirety,
            giving significance to each relevant piece of information and balancing the relative
            weights of all the various indicia of reliability (and unreliability) attending the tip.
            Instead, the court insisted on judging bits and pieces of information in isolation
            against the artificial standards provided by the two-pronged test.</p>
         <p>The Supreme Judicial Court also erred in failing to grant any deference to the decision
            of the Magistrate to issue a warrant. Instead of merely deciding whether the evidence
               <span class="star-pagination">*733</span> viewed as a whole provided a "substantial
            basis" for the Magistrate's finding of probable cause, the court conducted a de novo
            probable-cause determination. We rejected just such after-the-fact, de novo scrutiny in
            Gates. Id., at 236. "A grudging or negative attitude by reviewing courts toward
            warrants," United States v. Ventresca, 380 U. S. 102, 108 (1965), is inconsistent both
            with the desire to encourage use of the warrant process by police officers and with the
            recognition that once a warrant has been obtained, intrusion upon interests protected by
            the Fourth Amendment is less severe than otherwise may be the case. Gates, supra, at
            237, n. 10.<span class="sup">[*]</span> A deferential standard of review is appropriate
            to further the Fourth Amendment's strong preference for searches conducted pursuant to a
            warrant.</p>
         <p>Examined in light of Gates, Lieutenant Beland's affidavit provides a substantial basis
            for the issuance of the warrant. No single piece of evidence in it is conclusive. But
            the pieces fit neatly together and, so viewed, support the Magistrate's determination
            that there was "a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime" would be
            found in Upton's motor home. 462 U. S., at 238. The informant claimed to have seen the
            stolen goods and gave a description of them which tallied with the items taken in recent
            burglaries. She knew of the raid on the motel room &#x97; which produced evidence
            connected to those burglaries &#x97; and that the room had been reserved by Kelleher.
            She explained the connection between <span class="star-pagination">*734</span>
            Kelleher's motel room and the stolen goods in Upton's motor home. And she provided a
            motive both for her attempt at anonymity &#x97; fear of Upton's retaliation &#x97; and
            for furnishing the information &#x97; her recent breakup with Upton and her desire "to
            burn him."</p>
         <p>The Massachusetts court dismissed Lieutenant Beland's identification of the caller as a
            mere "unconfirmed guess." 390 Mass., at 569, n. 6, 458 N. E. 2d, at 721, n. 6. But
            "probable cause does not demand the certainty we associate with formal trials." Gates,
            supra, at 246. Lieutenant Beland noted that the caller "admitted that she was the girl I
            had named, stating that she was surprised that I knew who she was." It is of course
            possible that the caller merely adopted Lieutenant Beland's suggestion as "a convenient
            cover for her true identity." 390 Mass., at 570, 458 N. E. 2d, at 722. But given the
            caller's admission, her obvious knowledge of who Alberico was and how she was connected
            with Upton, and her explanation of her motive in calling, Lieutenant Beland's inference
            appears stronger than a mere uninformed and unconfirmed guess. It is enough that the
            inference was a reasonable one and conformed with the other pieces of evidence making up
            the total showing of probable cause.</p>
         <p>In concluding that there was probable cause for the issuance of this warrant, the
            Magistrate can hardly be accused of approving a mere "hunch" or a bare recital of legal
            conclusions. The informant's story and the surrounding facts possessed an internal
            coherence that gave weight to the whole. Accordingly, we conclude that the information
            contained in Lieutenant Beland's affidavit provided a sufficient basis for the
            "practical, common-sense decision" of the Magistrate. "Although in a particular case it
            may not be easy to determine when an affidavit demonstrates the existence of probable
            cause, the resolution of doubtful or marginal cases in this area should be largely
            determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants." United States v. Ventresca,
            supra, at 109.</p>

         <p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in the judgment.</p>
         <p>In my opinion the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts reflects an
            error of a more fundamental character than the one this Court corrects today. It rested
            its decision on the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution without telling
            us whether the warrant was valid as a matter of Massachusetts law.<span class="sup"
               >[1]</span> It has thereby increased its own burdens as well as ours. For when the
            case returns to that court, it must then review the probable-cause issue once again and
            decide whether or not a violation of the state constitutional protection against
            unreasonable searches and seizures has occurred. If such a violation did take place,
            much of that court's first opinion and all of this Court's opinion are for naught.<span
               class="sup">[2]</span> If no such violation occurred, the second <span
               class="star-pagination">*736</span> proceeding in that court could have been avoided
            by a ruling to that effect when the case was there a year ago.</p>
         <p>If the Magistrate had violated a state statute when he issued the warrant, surely the
            State Supreme Judicial Court would have so held and thereby avoided the necessity of
            deciding a federal constitutional question. I see no reason why it should not have
            followed the same sequence of analysis when an arguable violation of the State
            Constitution is disclosed by the record. As the Oregon Supreme Court has stated:</p>
         "The proper sequence is to analyze the state's law, including its constitutional law,
         before reaching a federal constitutional claim. This is required, not for the sake either
         of parochialism or of style, but because the state does not deny any right claimed under
         the federal Constitution when the claim before the court in fact is fully met by state
         law." Sterling v. Cupp, 290 Ore. 611, 614, 625 P. 2d 123, 126 (1981).<span class="sup"
            >[3]</span>
         <p>The maintenance of the proper balance between the respective jurisdictions of state and
            federal courts is always a difficult task. In recent years I have been concerned by what
            I have regarded as an encroachment by this Court into territory that should be reserved
            for state judges. See, e. g., Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1065 (1983) (STEVENS,
            J., dissenting); South Dakota v. Neville, 459 U. S. 553, 566 (1983) (STEVENS, J.,
            dissenting); Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449 U. S. 456, 477-489 (1981)
            (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Idaho Department of Employment v. Smith, 434 U. S. 100,
            103-105 (1977) (STEVENS, J., dissenting in part). The maintenance of this balance is,
            however, a two-way <span class="star-pagination">*737</span> street. It is also
            important that state judges do not unnecessarily invite this Court to undertake review
            of state-court judgments. I believe the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts unwisely
            and unnecessarily invited just such review in this case. Its judgment in this regard
            reflects a misconception of our constitutional heritage and the respective jurisdictions
            of state and federal courts.</p>
         <p>The absence of a Bill of Rights in the Constitution proposed by the Federal
            Constitutional Convention of 1787 was a major objection to the Convention's proposal.
            See, e. g., 12 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 438 (Boyd ed. 1955). In defense of the
            Convention's plan Alexander Hamilton argued that the enumeration of certain rights was
            not only unnecessary, given that such rights had not been surrendered by the people in
            their grant of limited powers to the Federal Government, but "would even be dangerous"
            on the ground that enumerating certain rights could provide a "plausible pretense" for
            the Government to claim powers not granted in derogation of the people's rights. The
            <ref type="" num="84">Federalist</ref> No. 84, pp. 573, 574 (Ford ed. 1898) (A. Hamilton). The latter argument
            troubled the First Congress during deliberations on the Bill of Rights, and its solution
            became the Ninth Amendment. See 1 Annals of Congress 439 (1789) (remarks of Rep.
            Madison).</p>
         <p>The Ninth Amendment provides: "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights,
            shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." To the
            extent that the Bill of Rights is applicable to the States under the Fourteenth
            Amendment, the principle embodied in the Ninth Amendment is applicable as well. The
            Ninth Amendment, it has been said, states but a truism. But that truism goes to the very
            core of the constitutional relationship between the individual and governmental
            authority, and, indeed, between sovereigns exercising authority over the individual.</p>
         <p>In my view, the court below lost sight of this truism, and permitted the enumeration of
            certain rights in the Fourth Amendment to disparage the rights retained by the people of
               <span class="star-pagination">*738</span> Massachusetts under Art. 14 of the
            Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. It is of course not my role to state what rights
            Art. 14 confers upon the people of Massachusetts; under our system of federalism, only
            Massachusetts can do that. The state court refused to perform that function, however,
            and instead strained to rest its judgment on federal constitutional grounds.</p>
         <p>Whatever protections Art. 14 does confer are surely disparaged when the Supreme Judicial
            Court of Massachusetts refuses to adjudicate their very existence because of the
            enumeration of certain rights in the Constitution of the United States. The rights
            conferred by Art. 14 may not only exceed the rights conferred by the Fourth Amendment as
            construed by this Court in Gates, but indeed may exceed the rights conferred by the
            Fourth Amendment as construed by the state court. The dissent followed the approach of
            the majority to its logical conclusion, stating that there "appears to be no logical
            basis, and no support in the case law, for interpreting the term `cause' in art. 14
            differently from the `probable cause' requirement of the Fourth Amendment." <span

            whether a state's guarantee is the same as or broader than its federal counterpart as
            interpreted by the Supreme Court. The right question is what the state's guarantee means
            and how it applies to the case at hand. The answer may turn out the same as it would
            under federal law. The state's law may prove to be more protective than federal law. The
            state law also may be less protective. In that case the court must go on to decide the
            claim under federal law, assuming it has been raised." Linde, E Pluribus &#x97;
            Constitutional Theory and State Courts, 18 Ga. L. Rev. 165, 179 (1984).</p>
         <p>It must be remembered that for the first century of this Nation's history, the Bill of
            Rights of the Constitution of the United States was solely a protection for the
            individual in relation to federal authorities. State Constitutions protected <span
               class="star-pagination">*739</span> the liberties of the people of the several States
            from abuse by state authorities. The Bill of Rights is now largely applicable to state
            authorities and is the ultimate guardian of individual rights. The States in our federal
            system, however, remain the primary guardian of the liberty of the people. The
            Massachusetts court, I believe, ignored this fundamental premise of our constitutional
            system of government. In doing so, it made an ill-advised entry into the federal
            domain.</p>
         <p>Accordingly, I concur in the Court's judgment.</p>

      <div type="notes">
         <p>[*] "If the affidavits submitted by police officers are subjected to the type of
            scrutiny some courts have deemed appropriate, police might well resort to warrantless
            searches, with the hope of relying on consent or some other exception to the Warrant
            Clause that might develop at the time of the search. In addition, the possession of a
            warrant by officers conducting an arrest or search greatly reduces the perception of
            unlawful or intrusive police conduct, by assuring `the individual whose property is
            searched or seized of the lawful authority of the executing officer, his need to search,
            and the limits of his power to search.' United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1, 9
            (1977)." Gates, 462 U. S., at 236.</p>
         <p>[1] Indeed, that court rather pointedly refused to consider whether the search violated
            the provisions of Art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. It stated, in
            part: </p>
         <p>"If we have correctly construed the significance of Illinois v. Gates, the Fourth
            Amendment standards for determining probable cause to issue a search warrant have not
            been made so much less clear and so relaxed as to compel us to try our hand at a
            definition of standards under art. 14. If we have misassessed the consequences of the
            Gates opinion and in fact the Gates standard proves to be unacceptably shapeless and
            permissive, this court may have to define the protections guaranteed to the people
            against unreasonable searches and seizures by art. 14, and the consequences of the
            violation of those protections." <span class="citation">
