         <p>Solicitor General Thacher, with whom Messrs. Wm. W. Scott, Robert P. Reeder, Erwin N.
            Griswold, and H. Brian Holland were on the brief, for the United States, in this case
            and the case next following.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*525</span> MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion
            of the Court.</p>
         <p>These cases are here on certificates from the Court of Claims. They involve the same
            questions, were argued together at the bar, and may well be disposed of by the same
            opinion.</p>
         <p>Daniel W. O'Donoghue is an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the District of
            Columbia, having been duly appointed to that position by the President, by and with the
            advice and consent of the Senate. He duly qualified as such justice on February 29,
            1932, and has ever since been engaged in the performance of the duties of the office. At
            the time of his appointment and entry upon his duties, his salary was fixed by act of
            Congress (c. 6, 44 Stat. 919) at the rate of $10,000 per year, which was paid to him
            until June 30, 1932.</p>
         <p>William Hitz is an associate justice of the Court of Appeals of the District of
            Columbia, having been appointed on December 5, 1930, by the President, and later
            confirmed by the Senate. On February 13, 1931, he duly qualified as such associate
            justice and has ever since been engaged in performing the duties of his office. By the
            act of Congress already referred to, his salary was fixed at the rate of $12,500 per
            year. This amount he received until June 30, 1932.</p>
         <p>By the Legislative Appropriation Act of June 30, 1932, (c. 314, 47 Stat. 382, 401)
            Congress provided as follows:</p>
         <p>"Sec. 105. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1933 &#x97;</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>.....</h2>
         <p>"(d) In the case of the following persons the rate of compensation is reduced as
            follows: If more than $1,000 per annum but less than $10,000 per annum, 8 1/3 per
            centum; if $10,000 per annum or more, but less than $12,000 per annum, 10 per centum; if
            $12,000 per annum or more, but less than $15,000 per annum, 12 per centum; if <span
               class="star-pagination">*526</span> $15,000 per annum or more, but less than $20,000
            per annum, 15 per centum; if $20,000 per annum or more, 20 per centum."</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>.....</h2>
         <p>"Sec. 106. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1933, the retired pay of all judges
            (except judges whose compensation may not, under the Constitution, be diminished during
            their continuance in office) and the retired pay of all commissioned and other personnel
            (except enlisted) of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Coast and Geodetic
            Survey, Lighthouse Service, and the Public Health Service shall be reduced as follows:
            If more than $1,000 per annum but less than $10,000 per annum, 8 1/3 per centum; if
            $10,000 per annum or more, but less than $12,000, 10 per centum; if $12,000 per annum or
            more, but less than $15,000 per annum, 12 per centum; if $15,000 per annum or more, but
            less than $20,000, 15 per centum; if $20,000 per annum or more, 20 per centum. This
            section shall not operate so as to reduce any rate of retired pay to less than $1,000
            per annum."</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>"SPECIAL SALARY REDUCTIONS"</h2>
         <p>Sec. 107. (a) During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1933 &#x97;</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>.....</h2>
         <p>"(5) the salaries and retired pay of all judges (except judges whose compensation may
            not, under the Constitution, be diminished during their continuance in office), if such
            salaries or retired pay are at a rate exceeding $10,000 per annum, shall be at the rate
            of $10,000 per annum."</p>
         <p>In July, 1932, the Comptroller General of the United States held that the Court of
            Appeals and the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia are "legislative" courts and
            not "constitutional" courts whose judges are entitled to the protection of Art. III, §
            1, of the Constitution, which provides:</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*527</span> "The judicial power of the United States shall
            be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from
            time to time ordain and establish. The Judges both of the Supreme and inferior Courts,
            shall hold their offices during good behavior, and shall, at stated times, receive for
            their services, a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance
            in office."</p>
         <p>Thereupon, the disbursing officer of the Department of Justice, pursuant to the ruling
            of the Comptroller General, reduced the annual compensation by 10 per cent. in the case
            of Justice O'Donoghue, and by 20 per cent. in the case of Justice Hitz, and over their
            protest paid to them for the months of July to December, 1932, inclusive, their
            compensation at this reduced rate.</p>
         <p>On January 19, 1933, suits were brought in the Court of Claims to recover the amount of
            the deductions which had been made and enforced up to that time.</p>
         <p>These suits are based upon the contention that the ruling of the Comptroller General,
            and the deductions made in pursuance thereof, are in violation of the provisions of the
            appropriation act just quoted, because § 107 specifically excepts from their operation
            "judges whose compensation may not, under the Constitution, be diminished during their
            continuance in office," and these plaintiffs are such judges. It is averred in the
            petitions that the ruling of the Comptroller General and the resulting deductions
            contravene Art. III, § 1, of the Constitution, since plaintiffs were appointed to serve
            during good behavior and to receive a compensation which constitutionally cannot be
            diminished during their continuance in office. It is further averred that the Supreme
            Court and Court of Appeals of the District are vested by acts of Congress with all the
            jurisdiction and all the power conferred on the United States by the Constitution under
            Art. III; that such jurisdiction and power have been exercised by the Court of Appeals
            from its organization <span class="star-pagination">*528</span> in 1893, and by the
            Supreme Court of the District and its predecessor courts from the establishment of the
            government; that, therefore, in the organization of these courts Congress acted in
            virtue of Art. III, and thereby constituted said courts inferior courts of the United
            States; that only to the extent that Congress has enlarged and extended the powers of
            said courts did that body act under any other than Art. III; and that they are none the
            less such inferior courts because, by reason of their location at the seat of
            government, Congress, under Art. I. § 8,<span class="sup">[*]</span> has conferred upon
            them powers and jurisdiction which it may not confer upon other federal courts. Each
            plaintiff avers a reluctance to institute a suit which may result in personal benefit to
            himself, but that he feels it a duty to the court, to the bar, to the citizens of the
            District of Columbia, and to the people of the United States to have the status of these
            important courts defined and settled as soon as possible.</p>
         <p>The Government demurred to the petitions, upon the ground, among others, that the
            justices of the District Supreme Court and Court of Appeals are not "judges of inferior
            courts" within the meaning of § 1 of Art. III of the Constitution, and are, therefore,
            not "judges whose compensation may not, under the Constitution, be diminished during
            their continuance in office." within the meaning of § 107 of the appropriation act
            hereinbefore quoted.</p>
         <p>Upon this state of the record the Court of Claims certified the following questions upon
            which it desires instructions, <span class="star-pagination">*529</span> under § 3 (a)
            of the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 939:</p>
         <p>"I. Does Section 1, Article III, of the Constitution of the United States apply to the
            Supreme Court [and to the Court of Appeals] of the District of Columbia and forbid a
            reduction of the compensation of the Justices thereof during their continuance in
            office?"</p>
         <p>"II. Can the compensation of a Justice of the Supreme Court [or of the Court of Appeals]
            of the District of Columbia be lawfully diminished during his continuance in
            office?"</p>
         <p>Before entering upon a consideration of the subject, it is well to observe that Congress
            has not undertaken by the legislation under review to assume or indicate any view of the
            meaning of the constitutional provision involved, but has left open the question whether
            these judges or others are judges "whose compensation may not, under the Constitution,
            be diminished during their continuance in office." This relieves us from the duty,
            always a delicate one, of passing upon the constitutionality of the congressional act,
            and only requires us to ascertain and determine the meaning and application of the
            constitutional provision, to which determination, by the plain intent of Congress, the
            act will immediately accommodate itself. That is to say, neither the terms nor intent of
            the statute, but only the application made of it by the Comptroller General, will be
            affected by the construction which we shall put upon the constitutional limitation.</p>
         <p>The questions propounded by the court below, find no answer in any conclusive
            adjudication of this court; and it will materially assist us in arriving at a correct
            determination if we shall first consider the great underlying purpose which the framers
            of the Constitution had in mind and which the them to incorporate in that instrument the
            provision in respect of the permanent tenure of office <span class="star-pagination"
               >*530</span> and the undiminishable character of the compensation of the judges.</p>
         <p>The Constitution, in distributing the powers of government, creates three distinct and
            separate departments &#x97; the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. This
            separation is not merely a matter of convenience or of governmental mechanism. Its
            object is basic and vital, Springer v. Philippine Islands, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/w7w/springer-v-philippine-islands/">
                  <span class="volume">277</span>
                  <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
                  <span class="page">189</span>
               </a>
            </span>, 201, namely, to preclude a commingling of these essentially different powers of
            government in the same hands. And this object is none the less apparent and controlling
            because there is to be found in the Constitution an occasional specific provision
            conferring upon a given department certain functions, which, by their nature would
            otherwise fall within the general scope of the powers of another. Such exceptions serve
            rather to emphasize the generally inviolate character of the plan.</p>
         <p>If it be important thus to separate the several departments of government and restrict
            them to the exercise of their appointed powers, it follows, as a logical corollary,
            equally important that each department should be kept completely independent of the
            others &#x97; independent not in the sense that they shall not cooperate to the common
            end of carrying into effect the purposes of the Constitution, but in the sense that the
            acts of each shall never be controlled by, or subjected, directly or indirectly, to, the
            coercive influence of either of the other departments. James Wilson, one of the framers
            of the Constitution and a justice of this court, in one of his law lectures said that
            the independence of each department required that its proceedings "should be free from
            the remotest influence, direct or indirect, of either of the other two powers." Andrews,
            The Works of James Wilson (1896), Vol. 1, p. 367. And the importance of such
            independence was similarly recognized by Mr. Justice Story when he said that in
            reference to each other, neither of the departments <span class="star-pagination"
               >*531</span> "ought to possess, directly or indirectly, an overruling influence in
            the administration of their respective powers." 1 Story on the Constitution, 4th ed., §
            530. To the same effect, The <ref type="intent" num="48">Federalist</ref> (Madison) No. 48. And see Massachusetts v.
            Mellon, <span class="citation">

               </a>
            </span>, 488.</p>
         <p>The anxiety of the framers of the Constitution to preserve the independence especially
            of the judicial department is manifested by the provision now under review, forbidding
            the diminution of the compensation of the judges of courts exercising the judicial power
            of the United States. This requirement was foreshadowed, and its vital character
            attested, by the Declaration of Independence, which, among the injuries and usurpations
            recited against the King of Great Britain, declared that he had "made judges dependent
            on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their
            salaries."</p>
         <p>In framing the Constitution, therefore, the power to diminish the compensation of the
            federal judges was explicitly denied, in order, inter alia, that their judgment or
            action might never be swayed in the slightest degree by the temptation to cultivate the
            favor or avoid the displeasure of that department which, as master of the purse, would
            otherwise hold the power to reduce their means of support. The high importance of the
            provision, as the contemporary history shows, was definitely pointed out by the leading
            statesmen of the time. Thus, in The <ref type="intent" num="78">Federalist</ref>, No. 78, Hamilton said &#x97; "The
            complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited
            Constitution." And, in No. 79 &#x97; "Next to permanency in office, nothing can
            contribute more to the independence of the judges than a fixed provision for their
            support. . . . In the general course of human nature, a power over a man's subsistence
            amounts to a power over his will." (The italics are in the original.)</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*532</span> Chief Justice Marshall, in the course of the
            debates of the Virginia State Convention of 1829-1830 (pp. 616, 619), used the following
            strong and frequently quoted language:</p>
         <p>"The Judicial Department comes home in its effects to every man's fireside; it passes on
            his property, his reputation, his life, his all. Is it not, to the last degree
            important, that he [the judge] should be rendered perfectly and completely independent,
            with nothing to influence or control him but God and his conscience? . . . I have always
            thought, from my earliest youth till now, that the greatest scourage an angry Heaven
            ever inflicted upon an ungrateful and a sinning people, was an ignorant, a corrupt, or a
            dependent Judiciary."</p>
         <p>In a very early period of our history, it was said, in words as true today as they were
            then, that "if they [the people] value and wish to preserve their Constitution, they
            ought never to surrender the independence of their judges." Rawle on the Constitution,
            2d ed., 281.</p>
         <p>We need not pursue this phase of the subject further. It is fully discussed in Evans v.
            Gore, <span class="citation">

               </a>
            </span>, where this court (pp. 248-249) said:</p>
         <p>"With what purpose does the Constitution provide that the compensation of the judges
            `shall not be diminished during their continuance in office'? Is it primarily to benefit
            the judges, or rather to promote the public weal by giving them that independence which
            makes for an impartial and courageous discharge of the judicial function? Does the
            provision merely forbid direct diminution, such as expressly reducing the compensation
            from a greater to a less sum per year, and thereby leave the way open for indirect, yet
            effective, diminution, such as withholding or calling back a part as a tax on the whole?
            Or, does it mean that the judge shall have a sure and continuing right to the
            compensation, whereon he confidently may rely for his support during his continuance in
            office, <span class="star-pagination">*533</span> so that he need have no apprehension
            lest his situation in this regard may be changed to his disadvantage?"</p>
         <p>And, after referring to statements from which we have quoted and others, the court added
            (p. 253):</p>
         <p>"These considerations make it very plain, as we think, that the primary purpose of the
            prohibition against diminution was not to benefit the judges, but, like the clause in
            respect of tenure, to attract good and competent men to the bench and to promote that
            independence of action and judgment which is essential to the maintenance of the
            guaranties, limitations and pervading principles of the Constitution and to the
            administration of justice without respect to persons and with equal concern for the poor
            and the rich. Such being its purpose, it is to be construed, not as a private grant, but
            as a limitation imposed in the public interest; in other words, not restrictively, but
            in accord with its spirit and the principle on which it proceeds.</p>
         <p>"Obviously, diminution may be effected in more ways than one. Some may be direct and
            others indirect, or even evasive as Mr. Hamilton suggested. But all which by their
            necessary operation and effect withhold or take from the judge a part of that which has
            been promised by law for his services must be regarded as within the prohibition.
            Nothing short of this will give full effect to its spirit and principle."</p>
         <p>In the light of the foregoing views, &#x97; time honored and never discredited &#x97; it
            is not extravagant to say that there rests upon every federal judge affected nothing
            less than a duty to withstand any attempt, directly or indirectly in contravention of
            the Constitution, to diminish this compensation, not for his private advantage &#x97;
            which, if that were all, he might willingly forego &#x97; but in the interest of
            preserving unimpaired an essential safeguard adopted as a continuing guaranty of an
            independent judicial administration for the benefit of the whole people. It was this
               <span class="star-pagination">*534</span> motive that impelled Chief Justice Taney to
            protest against the attempt of the Treasury Department to exact a tax upon the
            compensation of the judges under an act of Congress passed in 1862, c. 119, § 86, 12
            Stat. 472. 157 U.S., App. 701; Evans v. Gore, supra, pp. 257-259. The judges of the
            Court of Appeals of Virginia, as far back as 1788, in discharge of the same duty,
            directed to the members of the state assembly a "respectful remonstrance" against an act
            which had the effect of reducing their compensation. 4 Call (Va.) 135, 141. In the
            course of that remonstrance these judges said (pp. 143, 145):</p>
         <p>"The propriety and necessity of the independence of the judges is evident in reason and
            the nature of their office; since they are to decide between government and the people,
            as well as between contending citizens; and, if they be dependent on either, corrupt
            influence may be apprehended, sacrificing the innocent to popular prejudice; and
            subjecting the poor to oppression and persecution by the rich. And this applies more
            forcibly, to exclude a dependence on the legislature; a branch, of whom, in cases of
            impeachment, is itself a party. . . . For vain would be the precautions of the founders
            of our government to secure liberty, if the legislature, though restrained from changing
            the tenure of judicial offices, are at liberty to compel a resignation by reducing
            salaries to a copper, . . ."</p>
         <p>Actuated by like considerations of public duty, as it is averred, these plaintiffs
            brought the present suits.</p>
         <p>The judges of the Supreme Court and of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia
            are of equal rank and power with those of other inferior courts of the federal system,
            and plainly within the spirit and reason of the compensation provision; and also within
            its intent, unless there be something in the Constitution, or in the character or
            organization of the District or its relations to the <span class="star-pagination"
               >*535</span> general government, or in the character of the courts themselves which
            precludes that conclusion. Indeed, the reasons which have been set forth, and which
            impelled the adoption of the constitutional limitation, apply with even greater force to
            the courts of the District than to the inferior courts of the United States located
            elsewhere, because the judges of the former courts are in closer contact with, and more
            immediately open to the influences of, the legislative department, and exercise a more
            extensive jurisdiction in cases affecting the operations of the general government and
            its various departments.</p>
         <p>This court has repeatedly held that the territorial courts are "legislative" courts,
            created in virtue of the national sovereignty or under Art. IV, § 3, cl. 2, of the
            Constitution, vesting in Congress the power "to dispose of and make all needful rules
            and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United
            States"; and that they are not invested with any part of the judicial power defined in
            the third article of the Constitution. And this rule, as it affects the territories, is
            no longer open to question. Do the courts of the District of Columbia occupy a like
            situation in virtue of the plenary power of Congress, under Art. I, § 8, cl. 17, "To
            exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such district (not
            exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular States and the acceptance
            of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States . . ."? This inquiry
            requires a consideration, first, of the reasons upon which rest the decisions in respect
            of the territorial courts.</p>
         <p>The authority upon which all the later cases rest is American Insurance Co. v. Canter,

            </span>, 546, where the opinion was delivered by Chief Justice Marshall. The pertinent
            question there was whether the judicial power of the United States described in Art. III
            of the Constitution vested in the superior courts of the Territory of <span
               class="star-pagination">*536</span> Florida; and it was answered in the negative.
            "The Judges of the Superior Courts of Florida," the court said, "hold their offices for
            four years. These Courts, then, are not constitutional Courts, in which the judicial
            power conferred by the Constitution on the general government, can be deposited. They
            are incapable of receiving it. They are legislative Courts, created in virtue of the
            general right of sovereignty which exists in the government, or in virtue of that clause
            which enables Congress to make all needful rules and regulations, respecting the
            territory belonging to the United States. The jurisdiction with which they are invested,
            is not a part of that judicial power which is defined in the 3d article of the
            Constitution, but is conferred by Congress, in the execution of those general powers
            which that body possesses over the territories of the United States."</p>

         <p>A sufficient foundation for these decisions in respect of the territorial courts is to
            be found in the transitory character of the territorial governments. In the McAllister
            case, supra, this court, after stating that the Constitution had secured the
            independence of the judges of courts in which might be vested the judicial power of the
            United States by an express provision that they should hold office during good behavior
            and their compensation should not be diminished during their continuance therein,
            concluded (pp. 187-188) &#x97; "The absence from the Constitution of such guaranties for
            territorial judges was no doubt due to the fact that the organization of governments
               <span class="star-pagination">*537</span> for the Territories was but temporary, and
            would be superseded when the Territories became States of the Union." And in the
            concurring opinion of Mr. Justice White in Downes v. Bidwell, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/uoC/downes-v-bidwell/">
                  <span class="volume">182</span>

               </a>
            </span>, 293, these decisions are said to grow out of the "presumably ephemeral nature
            of a territorial government."</p>
         <p>In this connection, the peculiar language of the territorial clause, Art. IV, § 3, cl.
            2, of the Constitution, should be noted. By that clause Congress is given power "to
            dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other
            property belonging to the United States." Literally, the word "territory," as there
            used, signifies property, since the language is not "territory or property," but
            "territory or other property." There thus arises an evident difference between the words
            "the territory" and "a territory" of the United States. The former merely designates a
            particular part or parts of the earth's surface &#x97; the imperially extensive real
            estate holdings of the nation; the latter is a governmental subdivision which happened
            to be called a "territory," but which quite as well could have been called a "colony" or
            a "province." "The Territories," it was said in National Bank v. County of Yankton,
               <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/sMt/national-bank-v-county-of-yankton/">

               </a>
            </span>, 133, "are but political subdivisions of the outlying dominion of the United
            States." Since the Constitution provides for the admission by Congress of new states
            (Art. IV, § 3, cl. 1), it properly may be said that the outlying continental public
            domain, of which the United States was the proprietor, was, from the beginning, destined
            for admission as a state or states into the Union; and that as a preliminary step toward
            that foreordained end &#x97; to tide over the period of ineligibility &#x97; Congress,
            from time to time, created territorial governments, the existence of which was
            necessarily limited to the period of pupilage. In that view it is not unreasonable to
            conclude that the makers of the Constitution could never have intended to give <span
               class="star-pagination">*538</span> permanent tenure of office or irreducible
            compensation to a judge who was to serve during this limited and sometimes very brief
            period under a purely provisional government which, in all cases probably and in some
            cases certainly, would cease to exist during his incumbency of the office.</p>
         <p>The impermanent character of these governments has often been noted. Thus, it has been
            said, "The territorial state is one of pupilage at best," Nelson v. United States, 30
            Fed. 112, 115; "A territory, under the constitution and laws of the United States, is an
            inchoate state," Ex parte Morgan, 20 Fed. 298, 305; "During the term of their pupilage
            as Territories, they are mere dependencies of the United States." Snow v. United States,
               <span class="citation">

            </span>, 224, the court characterizes them as "the temporary territorial
            governments."</p>
         <p>How different are the status and characteristics of the District of Columbia! The
            pertinent clause of the Constitution (Art. I, § 8, cl. 17) confers the power on Congress
            to "exercise exclusive legislation . . . over such district . . . as may . . . become
            the seat of the government of the United States." These are words of permanent
            governmental power. The District, as the seat of the national government, is as lasting
            as the States from which it was carved or the union whose permanent capital it became.
            It could not have been intended otherwise; and it was thus recognized by the act of
            acceptance in 1790 (§ 1, c. 28, 1 Stat. 130): ". . . the [District] is hereby accepted
            for the permanent scat of the government of the United States."</p>
         <p>In the District clause, unlike the Territorial clause, there is no mere linking of the
            legislative processes to the disposal and regulation of the public domain &#x97; the
            landed estates of the sovereign &#x97; within which transitory governments to tide over
            the periods of pupilage may be constituted, <span class="star-pagination">*539</span>
            but an unqualified grant of permanent legislative power over a selected area set apart
            for the enduring purposes of the general government, to which the administration of
            purely local affairs is obviously subordinate and incidental. The District is not an
            "ephemeral" subdivision of the "outlying dominion of the United States," but the capital
            &#x97; the very heart &#x97; of the Union itself, to be maintained as the "permanent"
            abiding place of all its supreme departments, and within which the immense powers of the
            general government were destined to be exercised for the great and expanding population
            of forty-eight states, and for a future immeasurable beyond the prophetic vision of
            those who designed and created it.</p>
         <p>Over this District Congress possesses "the combined powers of a general and of a State
            government in all cases where legislation is possible." Stoutenburgh v. Hennick, <span
               class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/tt1/stoutenburgh-v-hennick/">

               </a>

            exclude, in respect of the District, the exercise by Congress of other appropriate
            powers conferred upon that body by the Constitution, or authorize a denial to the
            inhabitants of any constitutional guaranty not plainly inapplicable. Circuit Judge Taft,
            afterwards Chief Justice of this court, speaking for himself, Judge Lurton, afterwards
            an associate justice of this court, and Judge Hammond, in Grether v. Wright, 75 Fed.

            under it, said:</p>
         <p>"It was meet that so powerful a sovereignty should have a local habitation the character
            of which it might absolutely control, and the government of which it should not share
            with the states in whose territory it exercised but a limited sovereignty, supreme, it
            is true, in cases where it could be exercised at all, but much restricted in the field
            of its operation. The object of the grant of exclusive legislation over the district
            was, therefore, national in the highest sense, and the city organized under the <span
               class="star-pagination">*540</span> grant became the city, not of a state, not of a
            district, but of a nation. In the same article which granted the powers of exclusive
            legislation over its seat of government are conferred all the other great powers which
            make the nation, including the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States.
            He would be a strict constructionist, indeed, who should deny to congress the exercise
            of this latter power in furtherance of that of organizing and maintaining a proper local
            government at the seat of government. Each is for a national purpose and the one may be
            used in aid of the other."</p>

         <p>"There is nothing in the history of the Constitution or of the original amendments to
            justify the assertion that the people of this District may be lawfully deprived of the
            benefit of any of the constitutional guarantees of life, liberty, and property &#x97;
            especially of the privilege of trial by jury in criminal cases."</p>
         <p>It is important to bear constantly in mind that the District was made up of portions of
            two of the original states of the Union, and was not taken out of the Union by the
            cession. Prior thereto its inhabitants were entitled to all the rights, guaranties, and
            immunities of the Constitution, among which was the right to have their cases arising
            under the Constitution heard and determined by federal courts created under, and vested
            with the judicial power conferred by, Art. III. We think it is not reasonable to assume
            that the cession stripped them of these rights, and that it was intended that at the
            very seat of the national government the people should be less fortified by the guaranty
            of an independent judiciary than in other parts of the Union.</p>
         <p>In Downes v. Bidwell, supra, [162 U.S. 244,] in the opinion delivered by Mr. Justice
            Brown, at pp. 260-261, it is said:</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*541</span> "This District had been a part of the States
            of Maryland and Virginia. It had been subject to the Constitution, and was a part of the
            United States. The Constitution had attached to it irrevocably. There are steps which
            can never be taken backward. The tie that bound the States of Maryland and Virginia to
            the Constitution could not be dissolved, without at least the consent of the Federal and
            state government to a formal separation. The mere cession of the District of Columbia to
            the Federal government relinquished the authority of the States, but it did not take it
            out of the United States or from under the aegis of the Constitution. Neither party had
            ever consented to that construction of the cession. If, before the District was set off,
            Congress had passed an unconstitutional act, affecting its inhabitants, it would have
            been void. If done after the District was created, it would have been equally void; in
            other words, Congress could not do indirectly by carving out the District what it could
            not do directly. The District still remained a part of the United States, protected by
            the Constitution. Indeed, it would have been a fanciful construction to hold that
            territory which had been once a part of the United States ceased to be such by being
            ceded directly to the Federal government."</p>
         <p>That the Constitution is in effect in the territories as well as in the District has
            been so often determined in the affirmative that it is no longer an open question.
            Whether that instrument became operative in virtue of its own force, or because of its
            formal extension by acts of Congress, is a consideration which does not affect the
            present inquiry. It is enough that the Constitution is in force, and the question here,
            as well as in the case of the territories, is simply whether the provisions of Art. III
            relied upon are applicable. Because, for the peculiar reasons already stated, they are
            inapplicable to the territories, <span class="star-pagination">*542</span> it does not
            follow that they are likewise inapplicable to the District where these peculiar reasons
            do not obtain. In the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice White in the Downes case,
            certain principles applicable to the situation with which we are dealing are enumerated.
            Among them (pp. 289, 292) are these: "Every function of the government being thus
            derived from the Constitution, it follows that that instrument is everywhere and at all
            times potential in so far as its provisions are applicable. . . . In the case of the
            territories, as in every other instance, when a provision of the Constitution is
            invoked, the question which arises, is not whether the Constitution is operative, for
            that is self-evident, but whether the provision relied on is applicable." And then
            follows, almost immediately, at page 293, the observation already quoted, that the
            decisions in respect of the inapplicability of the third Article of the Constitution to
            the territorial courts grow out of the "presumably ephemeral nature of a territorial
            government."</p>
         <p>In the opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Brown, following the quotation which we have
            already made, it is said (p. 266):</p>
         <p>"As the only judicial power vested in Congress is to create courts whose judges shall
            hold their offices during good behavior, it necessarily follows that, if Congress
            authorizes the creation of courts and the appointment of judges for a limited time, it
            must act independently of the Constitution, and upon territory which is not part of the
            United States within the meaning of the Constitution. . . . It is sufficient to say that
            this case [American Insurance Co. v. Canter, supra] has ever since been accepted as
            authority for the proposition that the judicial clause of the Constitution has no
            application to courts created in the territories, and that with respect to them Congress
            has a power wholly unrestricted by it."</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*543</span> After an exhaustive review of the prior
            decisions of this court relating to the matter, the following propositions, among
            others, were stated as being established:</p>
         <p>"1. That the District of Columbia and the territories are not States, within the
            judicial clause of the Constitution giving jurisdiction in cases between citizens of
            different States;</p>
         <p>"2. That territories are not States, within the meaning of Revised Statutes, sec. 709,
            permitting writs of error from this court in cases where the validity of a state statute
            is drawn in question;</p>
         <p>"3. That the District of Columbia and the territories are States, as that word is used
            in treaties with foreign powers, with respect to the ownership, disposition and
            inheritance of property;</p>
         <p>"4. That the territories are not within the clause of the Constitution providing for the
            creation of a Supreme Court and such inferior courts as Congress may see fit to
            establish."</p>
         <p>The significant point to be observed in this enumeration is that the opinion is careful
            to distinguish between those propositions which relate both to the territories and the
            District of Columbia, and those which relate to the territories alone; so that when the
            court in paragraph 4 excepts from the operation of Art. III of the Constitution only the
            territories, it is equivalent to a determination either that the District was not
            subject to the same rule, or that the question in respect of the District had not then
            been decided.</p>
         <p>No less significant in this respect is the decision in Cross v. United States, <span
               class="citation">

            </span>, 576. In that case it was held that a writ of error would not lie to review a
            judgment of the Supreme Court of the District, sitting in appellate review of the
            conviction of a person of a capital crime. The government contended that the writ would
               <span class="star-pagination">*544</span> not lie because the Supreme Court of the
            District was not a court of the United States within the intent and meaning of the act
            of Congress of February 6, 1889, c. 113, 25 Stat 655, which provided that in capital
            cases tried before "any court of the United States" the final judgment could be reviewed
            by this court upon a writ of error. McAllister v. United States, supra, was cited in
            support of that contention, but this court said, ". . . it is to be remembered that that
            case referred to territorial courts only." And the contention of the government in this
            respect was rejected, the writ being dismissed on a different ground.</p>
         <p>In American Insurance Co. v. Canter, supra, the Chief Justice gave as a conclusive
            reason why the territorial courts were not constitutional courts vested with the
            judicial power designated in Art. III of the Constitution that &#x97; "They are
            incapable of receiving it." It is not hard to justify this observation in respect of
            courts created for a purely provisional government to serve merely between events; but
            the District Supreme Court and Court of Appeals are permanent establishments &#x97;
            federal courts of the United States and part of the federal judicial system. Federal

         <p>In the light of all that has now been said, we are unable to perceive upon what basis of
            reason it can be said that these courts of the District are incapable of receiving the
               <span class="star-pagination">*545</span> judicial power under Art. III. In respect
            of them we take the true rule to be that they are courts of the United States, vested
            generally with the same jurisdiction as that possessed by the inferior federal courts
            located elsewhere in respect of the cases enumerated in § 2 of Art. III. The provision
            of this section of the article is that the "judicial power shall extend" to the cases
            enumerated, and it logically follows that where jurisdiction over these cases is
            conferred upon the courts of the District, the judicial power, since they are capable of
            receiving it, is, ipso facto, vested in such courts as inferior courts of the United
            States.</p>
         <p>The fact that Congress, under another and plenary grant of power, has conferred upon
            these courts jurisdiction over non-federal causes of action, or over quasijudicial or
            administrative matters, does not affect the question. In dealing with the District,
            Congress possesses the powers which belong to it in respect of territory within a state,
            and also the powers of a state. Keller v. Potomac Elec. Co., <span class="citation">

            authority over the District and may clothe the courts of the District not only with the
            jurisdiction and powers of federal courts in the several States but with such authority
            as a State may confer on her courts. Kendall v. United States, <span class="citation">

            personal liberty in the amendments and in the original Constitution, Congress has as
            much power to vest courts of the District with a variety of jurisdiction and powers as a
            state legislature has in conferring jurisdiction on its courts. In Prentis v. Atlantic
            Coast Line Co., supra, we <span class="star-pagination">*546</span> held that when `a
            state constitution sees fit to unite legislative and judicial powers in a single hand,
            there is nothing to hinder so far as the Constitution of the United States is
            concerned.' (211 U.S. 225.) Dreyer v. Illinois, <span class="citation">

         <p>If, in creating and defining the jurisdiction of the courts of the District, Congress
            were limited to Art. III, as it is in dealing with the other federal courts, the
            administrative and other jurisdiction spoken of could not be conferred upon the former.
            But the clause giving plenary power of legislation over the District enables Congress to
            confer such jurisdiction in addition to the federal jurisdiction which the District
            courts exercise under Art. III, notwithstanding that they are recipients of the judicial
            power of the United States under, and are constituted in virtue of, that article.</p>
         <p>Since Congress, then, has the same power under Art. III of the Constitution to ordain
            and establish inferior federal courts in the District of Columbia as in the states,
            whether it has done so in any particular instance depends upon the same inquiry &#x97;
            Does the judicial power conferred extend to the cases enumerated in that article? If it
            does, the judicial power thus conferred is not and cannot be affected by the additional
            congressional legislation, enacted under Article I, § 8, cl. 17, imposing upon such
            courts other duties, which, because that special power is limited to the District,
            Congress cannot impose upon inferior federal courts elsewhere. The two powers are not
            incompatible; and we perceive no reason for holding that the plenary power given by the
            District clause of the Constitution may be used to destroy the operative effect of the
            judicial clause within the District, where, unlike the territories occupying a different
            status, that clause is entirely appropriate and applicable.</p>
         <p>The matter has been well stated by Mr. Justice Groner speaking for the District Court of
            Appeals. in Pitts v. <span class="star-pagination">*547</span> Peak, 60 App.D.C. 195,
            197, 50 F. (2d) 485, 487, a case which we had occasion very recently to cite
            (Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry v. United States, supra, at p. 391):</p>
         <p>"But it by no means follows that because Congress has seen fit, by virtue of its
            authority over the District of Columbia, to confer upon the courts of the District
            administrative functions, which outside the District it may not confer upon courts
            created solely under article 3, these courts are any the less created under that article
            of the Constitution, nor do we know of anything in the history of these courts or in the
            legislation with relation to them which would indicate the contrary. We think a
            reasonable and correct view of the subject would indicate that, in the creation and
            organization of the superior courts of the District of Columbia, Congress has availed of
            its dual constitutional right in the first place to establish courts of law and invest
            them, as it has, with power and jurisdiction over all cases and controversies [with]
            which, under the authority of article 3, it has invested the district courts of the
            United States, and, in the second place, in the exercise of the power of a sovereign
            state, under the provisions of section 8 of article 1, has further imposed upon them
            jurisdiction and power which it cannot impose upon other like courts functioning outside
            the District. There is no inhibition in the Constitution against the exercise by
            Congress of this dual power, arising as it does out of an express grant in the one case
            (article 3) and an implied grant in the other (article 1, § 8), nor does its exercise in
            the one case exhaust its power and prevent its exercise in the other, and therefore we
            assume, when Congress created the two courts &#x97; the District Courts of the United
            States and the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia &#x97; and gave to each, within
            its own sphere, identical jurisdiction, that it drew its power from the same source,
            even though it was necessary it should have recourse to another provision of the
            Constitution in order <span class="star-pagination">*548</span> to clothe the courts at
            the seat of government with other and additional authority not permissible under article
            3."</p>
         <p>And see also James v. United States, 38 Ct. Cls. 615, 627-631, which this court on
            appeal disposed of on another ground, saying it was unnecessary to decide the
            constitutional question. 202 U.S. 401.</p>
         <p>The conclusion to which we have come is in accord with the continuous and unbroken
            practice of Congress from the beginning of the government. In 1801 (c. 15, § 3, 2 Stat.
            103, 105) Congress established the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia, the judges
            thereof to hold office during good behavior, giving the court and the judges the same
            powers as were vested in the circuit courts of the United States and the judges thereof.
            In 1863, that court was superseded by, and its jurisdiction conferred upon, the present
            District Supreme Court (c. 91, 12 Stat. 762), the judges to hold their offices during
            good behavior. Many acts of Congress refer to these courts as "courts of the United
            States." In the District Code, passed March 3, 1901 (c. 854, 31 Stat. 1189), it is
            provided, § 61, that the Supreme Court of the District "shall be deemed a court of the
            United States." And § 84 provides that it "shall have and exercise the same powers and
            jurisdiction as the other district courts of the United States." In Swift &amp;amp; Co.

            case arising under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, because it was not a district court of
            the United States within the meaning of that act; but this court held that the
            contention had been adversely disposed of by Federal Trade Comm'n v. Klesner, supra; and
            in a footnote at page 325 attention was called to the fact that suits to enjoin patent
            infringements under R.S. § 4921 are entertained by the Supreme Court of the District
            solely by virtue of its general powers as "a District Court of the United States."</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*549</span> The District Court of Appeals was established
            in 1893 (c. 74, 27 Stat. 434), the judges to hold office during good behavior. Congress
            invariably has fixed the same salaries for the judges of the Supreme Court of the
            District as for the judges of the district courts of the United States sitting
            elsewhere, and the salaries of the judges of the District Court of Appeals the same as
            for the judges of the United States circuit courts of appeals. When one has been
            increased, the other has been increased in like amount. Indeed, the congressional
            practice from the beginning recognizes a complete parallelism between the courts of the
            District and the district and circuit courts of appeals of the United States. See
            Federal Trade Comm'n v. Klesner, supra, generally, and especially the language already
            quoted.</p>
         <p>The protest of Chief Justice Taney apparently did not bear fruit until 1869, at which
            time Attorney General Hoar delivered an opinion in response to a request of the
            Secretary of the Treasury, holding that if the act of 1862 imposed a tax upon the
            salaries of the President and the justices of the Supreme and inferior courts of the
            United States, it was unconstitutional. 13 Op. Atty. Gen. 161. Upon this authority the
            taxes which had been paid were refunded, and in 1872 a like refund of taxes was made to
            the judges of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, as shown by the records and
            files of the Treasury Department.</p>
         <p>It is true, of course, that Congress, in conferring the life tenure upon the judges of
            the courts of the District, and in doing the other things mentioned above, might have
            done so merely as a matter of legislative discretion, without deeming it to be a matter
            of constitutional compulsion. Nevertheless, a practice so uniform and continuous
            indicates, with some degree of persuasive force, that Congress entertained the view that
            the courts of the District and the inferior courts of the United States sitting <span
               class="star-pagination">*550</span> elsewhere, stood upon the same constitutional
            footing. In any event, it is not without significance that in the acts of Congress from
            the beginning of the government to the present day, nothing has been brought to our
            attention that is inconsistent with that view.</p>
         <p>The government relies almost entirely upon the decision of this court in Ex parte
            Bakelite Corp., <span class="citation">

            </span>. In that case we held that the Court of Customs Appeals was a legislative court,
            not a constitutional court under Art. III of the Constitution. In the course of the
            opinion attention was called to the decisions in respect of the territorial courts, and
            it was said that a like view had been taken in respect of the status and jurisdiction of
            the courts provided by Congress for the District of Columbia. This observation, made
            incidentally, by way of illustration merely and without discussion or elaboration, was
            not necessary to the decision, and is not in harmony with the views expressed in the
            present opinion. "It is a maxim, not to be disregarded," said Chief Justice Marshall in
            Cohens v. Virginia, <span class="citation">

            with the case in which those expressions are used. If they go beyond the case, they may
            be respected, but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit when the very
            point is presented for decision. The reason of this maxim is obvious. The question
            actually before the Court is investigated with care, and considered in its full extent.
            Other principles which may serve to illustrate it, are considered in their relation to
            the case decided, but their possible bearing on all other cases is seldom completely
            investigated."</p>
         <p>Two cases are cited in support of the dictum in the Bakelite opinion &#x97; Keller v.
            Potomac Elec. Co., supra, and Postum Cereal Co. v. Calif. Fig Nut Co., <span
               class="citation">

            </span>, 700. The Keller case we have already discussed. It simply holds that in virtue
            of its dual power over the <span class="star-pagination">*551</span> District, Congress
            may vest non-judicial functions in the courts of the District. We find nothing in that
            decision which cannot be reconciled with what we have here said. In the case of Postum
            Cereal Co., the court follows the Keller case in holding that administrative or
            legislative functions may be vested in the courts of the District, but adds that this
            may not be done with any federal court established under Art. III of the Constitution.
            Taken literally, this seems to negative the view that the superior courts of the
            District are established under Art. III. But the observation, read in the light of what
            was said in the Keller case in respect of the dual power of Congress in dealing with the
            courts of the District, should be confined to federal courts in the states as to which
            no such dual power exists; and thus confined, it is not in conflict with the view that
            Congress derives from the District clause distinct powers in respect of the
            constitutional courts of the District which Congress does not possess in respect of such
            courts outside the District.</p>
         <p>We hold that the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia are
            constitutional courts of the United States, ordained and established under Art. III of
            the Constitution; that the judges of these courts hold their offices during good
            behavior, and that their compensation cannot, under the Constitution, be diminished
            during their continuance in office.</p>
         <p>In accordance with that view the questions propounded are answered.</p>
         <p>Question No. 1, Yes.</p>
         <p>Question No. 2, No.</p></div>
      <div type="dissent" judge="van devanter">
         <p>The CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER, and MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO, dissenting.</p>
         <p>We are of the opinion that the courts of the District of Columbia, as this court has
            repeatedly declared, are <span class="star-pagination">*552</span> not courts
            established under § 1 of Article III of the Constitution, but are established under the
            broad authority conferred upon the Congress for the government of the District of
            Columbia by paragraph 17 of § 8 of Article I. Hence, the limitations imposed by § 1 of
            Article III, with respect to tenure and compensation, are not applicable to judges of
            these courts. The special authority conferred for the government of the District of
            Columbia necessarily includes the power to establish courts deemed to be appropriate for
            the District (Kendall v. United States, <span class="citation">

               </a>
            </span>, 619), including the power to fix and alter tenure and compensation. It is a
            power complete in itself and derives nothing from § 1 of Article III. It is a power not
            less complete, but essentially the same as that which is conferred upon the Congress for
            the government of territories. American Insurance Co. v. Canter, <span

            </span>. It is not a dual power in the sense that it is derived from two sources, that
            is, both from Article III and also from the constitutional provision for the government
            of the District, but is dual only in the sense that the latter provision confers an
            authority so broad that it enables the Congress to invest the courts of the District not
            only with jurisdiction and powers analogous to those of federal courts within the States
            but also with jurisdiction and powers analogous to those which States may vest in their
            own courts. As the courts of the District do not rest for their creation on § 1 of
            Article III, their creation is not subject to any of the limitations of that provision.
            Nor would those limitations, if considered to be applicable, be susceptible of division
            so that some might be deemed obligatory and others might be ignored. If the limitations
            relating to courts established under § 1 of Article III applied to the courts of the
            District of Columbia, they would necessarily prevent the attaching to the latter courts
            of jurisdiction and powers of an administrative <span class="star-pagination"
               >*553</span> sort. It is only because the Congress, in establishing the courts of the
            District of Columbia, is free from the limitations imposed by § 1 of Article III that
            administrative powers can be, and are, conferred upon them. Keller v. Potomac Electric
