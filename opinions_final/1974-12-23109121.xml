         </span> (1974) SCHICK v. REED, CHAIRMAN, UNITED STATES BOARD OF PAROLE, ET AL. No. 73-5677.
            <p>Supreme Court of United States.</p> Argued October 23, 1974. Decided December 23,
         1974. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
         CIRCUIT. <p>Homer E. Moyer, Jr., argued the cause for petitioner pro hac vice. With him on
            the briefs was Robert N. Sayler.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*257</span> Louis F. Claiborne argued the cause for
            respondents. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Bork, Assistant Attorney
            General Petersen, and Harry R. Sachse.</p>
         <p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
         <p>In 1960, the President, acting under the authority of Art. II. § 2, cl. 1, of the
            Constitution, commuted petitioner Maurice L. Schick's sentence from death to life
            imprisonment, subject to the condition that he would not thereafter be eligible for
            parole. The petitioner challenges the validity of the condition, and we granted
            certiorari to determine the enforceability of that commutation as so conditioned.</p>
         <p>The pertinent facts are undisputed. In 1954 petitioner, then a master sergeant in the
            United States Army stationed in Japan, was tried before a court-martial for the brutal
            murder of an eight-year-old girl. He admitted the killing, but contended that he was
            insane at the time that he committed it. Medical opinion differed on this point. Defense
            experts testified that petitioner could neither distinguish between right and wrong nor
            adhere to the right when he killed the girl; a board of psychiatrists testifying on
            behalf of the prosecution concluded that petitioner was suffering from a nonpsychotic
            behavior disorder and was mentally aware of and able to control his actions. The
            court-martial rejected petitioner's defense and he was sentenced to death on March 27,
            1954, pursuant to Art. 118 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U. S. C. § 918.
            The conviction and sentence were affirmed by an Army Board of Review and, following a
            remand for consideration of additional psychiatric reports, by the Court of Military
            Appeals. 7 U. S. C. M. A. 419, 22 C. M. R. 209 (1956).</p>
         <p>The case was then forwarded to President Eisenhower for final review as required by Art.
            71 (a) of the UCMJ, <span class="star-pagination">*258</span> 10 U. S. C. § 871 (a). The
            President acted on March 25, 1960:</p> "[P]ursuant to the authority vested in me as
         President of the United States by Article II, Section 2, Clause 1, of the Constitution, the
         sentence to be put to death is hereby commuted to dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all
         pay and allowances becoming due on and after the date of this action, and confinement at
         hard labor for the term of his [petitioner's] natural life. This commutation of sentence is
         expressly made on the condition that the said Maurice L. Schick shall never have any
         rights, privileges, claims, or benefits arising under the parole and suspension or
         remission of sentence laws of the United States and the regulations promulgated thereunder
         governing Federal prisoners confined in any civilian or military penal institution (18 U.
         S. C. 4201 et seq., 10 USC 3662 et seq., 10 USC 871, 874), or any acts amendatory or
         supplementary thereof." App. 35. <p>The action of the President substituted a life sentence
            for the death sentence imposed in 1954, subject to the conditions described in the
            commutation. Petitioner was accordingly discharged from the Army and transferred to the
            Federal Penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pa. He has now served 20 years of his sentence. Had
            he originally received a sentence of life imprisonment he would have been eligible for
            parole consideration in March 1969; the condition in the President's order of
            commutation barred parole at any time.</p>
         <p>In 1971, while appeals challenging the validity of the death penalty were pending in
            this Court, petitioner field suit in the United States District Court for the District
            of Columbia to require the members of the United States Board of Parole to consider him
            for parole. The District <span class="star-pagination">*259</span> Court granted the
            Board of Parole's motion for summary judgment and the Court of Appeals affirmed,
            unanimously upholding the President's power to commute a sentence upon condition that
            the prisoner not be paroled. In addition, it rejected by a 2-1 vote petitioner's
            argument that Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, decided on June 29, 1972, requires that
            he be resentenced to a simple life term, the alternative punishment for murder under
            Art. 118. 157 U. S. App. D. C. 263, 483 F. 2d 1266. We affirm the judgment of the Court
            of Appeals.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>When the death sentence was imposed in 1954 it was, as petitioner concedes, valid under
            the Constitution of the United States and subject only to final action by the President.
            Absent the commutation of March 25, 1960, the sentence could, and in all probability
            would, have been carried out prior to 1972. Only the President's action in commuting the
            sentence under his Art. II powers, on the conditions stipulated, prevented execution of
            the sentence imposed by the court-martial.</p>
         <p>The essence of petitioner's case is that, in light of this Court's holding in Furman v.
            Georgia, supra, which he could not anticipate, he made a "bad bargain" by accepting a
            no-parole condition in place of a death sentence. He does not cast his claim in those
            terms, of course. Rather, he argues that the conditions attached to the commutation put
            him in a worse position than he would have been in had he contested his death
            sentence&#x97;and remained alive&#x97;until the Furman case was decided 18 years after
            that sentence was originally imposed.</p>
         <p>It is correct that pending death sentences not carried out prior to Furman were thereby
            set aside without conditions such as were attached to petitioner's commutation. However,
            petitioner's death sentence was not pending in 1972 because it had long since been
            commuted. <span class="star-pagination">*260</span> The question here is whether Furman
            must now be read as nullifying the condition attached to that commutation when it was
            granted in 1960. Alternatively, petitioner argues that even in 1960 President Eisenhower
            exceeded his powers under Art. II by imposing a condition not expressly authorized by
            the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</p>
         <p>In sum, petitioner's claim gives rise to three questions: First, was the conditional
            commutation of his death sentence lawful in 1960; second, if so, did Furman
            retroactively void such conditions; and third, does that case apply to death sentences
            imposed by military courts where the asserted vagaries of juries are not present as in
            other criminal cases? Our disposition of the case will make it unnecessary to reach the
            third question.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>The express power of Art. II, § 2, cl. 1, from which the Presidential power to commute
            criminal sentences derives, is to "grant Reprieves and Pardons . . . except in Cases of
            Impeachment." Although the authors of this clause surely did not act thoughtlessly,
            neither did they devote extended debate to its meaning. This can be explained in large
            part by the fact that the draftsmen were well acquainted with the English Crown
            authority to alter and reduce punishments as it existed in 1787. The history of that
            power, which was centuries old, reveals a gradual contraction to avoid its abuse and
               misuse.<span class="sup">[1]</span> Changes were made as potential or actual abuses
            were perceived; for example, Parliament restricted the power to grant a pardon to one
            who transported a prisoner overseas to evade the Habeas Corpus Act, because to allow
            such pardons would drain the Great Writ of its vitality. There <span
               class="star-pagination">*261</span> were other limits, but they were few in number
            and similarly specifically defined.<span class="sup">[2]</span>
         </p>
         <p>At the time of the drafting and adoption of our Constitution it was considered
            elementary that the prerogative of the English Crown could be exercised upon
            conditions:</p> "It seems agreed, That the king may extend his mercy on what terms he
         pleases, and consequently may annex to his pardon any condition that he thinks fit, whether
         precedent or subsequent, on the performance whereof the validity of the pardon will
         depend." 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown 557 (6th ed. 1787). <p>Various types of
            conditions, both penal and nonpenal in nature, were employed.<span class="sup"
               >[3]</span> For example, it was common for a pardon or commutation to be granted on
            condition that the felon be transported to another place, and indeed our own Colonies
            were the recipients of numerous subjects of "banishment." This practice was never
            questioned despite the fact that British subjects generally could not be forced to leave
            the realm without an Act of Parliament and banishment was rarely authorized as a
            punishment for crime. The idea later developed that the subject's consent to
            transportation was necessary, but in most cases he was simply "agreeing" that his life
            should be spared. Thus, the requirement of consent was a legal fiction at best; in
            reality, by granting pardons or commutations conditional upon banishment, the Crown was
            exercising a power that was the equivalent and completely <span class="star-pagination"
               >*262</span> independent of legislative authorization.<span class="sup">[4]</span> 11
            W. Holdsworth, History of English Law 569-575 (1938). In short, by 1787 the English
            prerogative to pardon was unfettered except for a few specifically enumerated
            limitations.</p>
         <p>The history of our executive pardoning power reveals a consistent pattern of adherence
            to the English commonlaw practice. The records of the Constitutional Convention, as
            noted earlier, reveal little discussion or debate on § 2, cl. 1, of Art. II. The first
            report of the Committee on Detail proposed that the pertinent clause read: "He [the
            President] shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons; but his pardon shall not be
            pleadable in bar of an impeachment."<span class="sup">[5]</span> This limitation as to
            impeachments tracked a similar restriction upon the English royal prerogative which
            existed in 1787. 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *399-400. An effort was made in the
            Convention to amend what finally emerged as § 2, cl. 1, and is reflected in James
            Madison's Journal for August 25, 1787, where the following note appears:</p> "Mr.
         Sherman moved to amend the `power to grant reprieves and pardons' so as to read `to grant
         reprieves until the next session of the Senate, and pardons with consent of the Senate.' "
         2 M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 419 (1911). <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*263</span> The proposed amendment was rejected by a vote
            of 8-1. Ibid. This action confirms that, as in England in 1787, the pardoning power was
            intended to be generally free from legislative control.</p>
         <p>Later Edmund Randolph proposed to add the words " `except cases of treason.' " Madison's
            description of Randolph's argument reflects familiarity with the English form and
            practice: "The prerogative of pardon in these [treason] cases was too great a trust."
            Id., at 626 (emphasis added). Randolph's proposal was rejected by a vote of 8-2, and the
            clause was adopted in its present form. Thereafter, Hamilton's Federalist No. 69
            summarized the proposed § 2 powers, including the power to pardon, as "resembl[ing]
            equally that of the King of Great-Britain and the Governor of New-York." The <ref type="intent" num="69">Federalist</ref>
            No. 69, p. 464 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).<span class="sup">[6]</span>
         </p>
         <p>We see, therefore, that the draftsmen of Art. II, § 2, spoke in terms of a "prerogative"
            of the President, which ought not be "fettered or embarrassed." In light of the English
            common law from which such language was <span class="star-pagination">*264</span> drawn,
            the conclusion is inescapable that the pardoning power was intended to include the power
            to commute sentences on conditions which do not in themselves offend the Constitution,
            but which are not specifically provided for by statute.</p>
         <p>The few cases decided in this area are consistent with the view of the power described
            above. In United States v. Wilson, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/rvF/united-states-v-wilson/">
                  <span class="volume">7</span>
                  <span class="reporter">Pet.</span>
                  <span class="page">150</span>
               </a>
            </span> (1833), this Court was confronted with the question of whether a pardon must be
            pleaded in order to be effective. Mr. Chief Justice Marshall held for the Court that it
            must, because that was the English common-law practice:</p> "As this power had been
         exercised from time immemorial by the executive of that nation whose language is our
         language, and to whose judicial institutions ours bear a close resemblance; we adopt their
         principles respecting the operation and effect of a pardon, and look into their books for
         the rules prescribing the manner in which it is to be used by the person who would avail
         himself of it." Id., at 160. <p>Similarly, in Ex parte Wells, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/rSg/ex-parte-wells/">
                  <span class="volume">18</span>
                  <span class="reporter">How.</span>
                  <span class="page">307</span>
               </a>
            </span> (1856), the petitioner had been convicted of murder and sentenced to be hanged.
            President Fillmore granted a pardon " `upon condition that he be imprisoned during his
            natural life; that is, the sentence of death is hereby commuted to imprisonment for life
            in the penitentiary of Washington.' " Id., at 308. Later, Wells sought release by habeas
            corpus, contending that the condition annexed to the pardon and accepted by him was
            illegal. His argument was remarkably similar to that made by petitioner here:</p> "[A]
         President granting such a pardon assumes a power not conferred by the
         constitution&#x97;that he legislates a new punishment into existence, and sentences <span
            class="star-pagination">*265</span> the convict to suffer it; in this way violating the
         legislative and judicial powers of the government, it being the province of the first, to
         enact laws for the punishment of offences . . . , and that of the judiciary, to sentence .
         . . according to them." Id., at 309. <p>However, the Court was not persuaded. After an
            extensive review of the English common law and that of the States, which need not be
            repeated here, it concluded:</p> "The real language of [Art. II, § 2, cl. 1] is general,
         that is, common to the class of pardons, or extending the power to pardon to all kinds of
         pardons known in the law as such, whatever may be their denomination. We have shown that a
         conditional pardon is one of them. . . . "In this view of the constitution, by giving to
         its words their proper meaning, the power to pardon conditionally is not one of inference
         at all, but one conferred in terms. ..... ". . . [T]he power to offer a condition, without
         ability to enforce its acceptance, when accepted by the convict, is the substitution, by
         himself, of a lesser punishment than the law has imposed upon him, and he cannot complain
         if the law executes the choice he has made. " `. . . And a man condemned to be hung cannot
         be permitted to escape the punishment altogether, by pleading that he had accepted his life
         by duress per minas.' " Id., at 314-315. <p>In other words, this Court has long read the
            Constitution as authorizing the President to deal with individual cases by granting
            conditional pardons. The very essence of the pardoning power is to treat each case
            individually.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*266</span> The teachings of Wilson and Wells have been
            followed consistently by this Court. See, e. g., Ex parte Grossman, 267 U. S. 87 (1925)
            (upholding a Presidential pardon of a contempt of court against an argument that it
            violated the principle of separation of powers); Ex parte Garland, <span
               class="citation">

               </a>
            </span> (1867). Additionally, we note that Presidents throughout our history as a Nation
            have exercised the power to pardon or commute sentences upon conditions that are not
            specifically authorized by statute. Such conditions have generally gone unchallenged
            and, as in the Wells case, attacks have been firmly rejected by the courts. See 41 Op.
            Atty. Gen. 251 (1955). These facts are not insignificant for our interpretation of Art.
            II, § 2, cl. 1, because, as observed by Mr. Justice Holmes: "If a thing has been
            practised for two hundred years by common consent, it will need a strong case" to
            overturn it. Jackman v. Rosenbaum Co., 260 U. S. 22, 31 (1922).</p>

            2, cl. 1, derives, of the language of that clause itself, and of the unbroken practice
            since 1790 compels the conclusion that the power flows from the Constitution alone, not
            from any legislative enactments, and that it cannot be modified, abridged, or diminished
            by the Congress. Additionally, considerations of public policy and humanitarian impulses
            support an interpretation of that power so as to permit the attachment of any condition
            which does not otherwise offend the Constitution. The plain purpose of the board power
            conferred by § 2, cl. 1, was to allow plenary authority in the President to "forgive"
            the convicted person in part or entirely, to reduce a penalty in terms of a specified
            number of years, or to alter it with conditions which are in themselves constitutionally
            unobjectionable. If we were <span class="star-pagination">*267</span> to accept
            petitioner's contentions, a commutation of his death sentence to 25 or 30 years would be
            subject to the same challenge as is now made, i. e., that parole must be available to
            petitioner because it is to others. That such an interpretation of § 2, cl. 1, would in
            all probability tend to inhibit the exercise of the pardoning power and reduce the
            frequency of commutations is hardly open to doubt. We therefore hold that the pardoning
            power is an enumerated power of the Constitution and that its limitations, if any, must
            be found in the Constitution itself. It would be a curious logic to allow a convicted
            person who petitions for mercy to retain the full benefit of a lesser punishment with
            conditions, yet escape burdens readily assumed in accepting the commutation which he
            sought.</p>
         <p>Petitioner's claim must therefore fail. The no-parole condition attached to the
            commutation of his death sentence is similar to sanctions imposed by legislatures such
            as mandatory minimum sentences or statutes otherwise precluding parole;<span class="sup"
               >[7]</span> it does not offend the Constitution. Similarly, the President's action
            derived solely from his Art. II powers; it did not depend upon Art. 118 of the UCMJ or
            any other statute fixing a death penalty for murder. It is not correct to say that the
            condition upon petitioner's commutation was "made possible only through the
            court-martial's imposition of the death sentence." Post, at 269-270. Of course, the
            President may not aggravate punishment; the sentence imposed by statute is therefore
            relevant to a limited extent. But, as shown, the President has constitutional power to
            attach conditions to his commutation of any sentence. Thus, even if Furman v. Georgia
            applies to the military, a matter which we need not and do not decide, it could <span
               class="star-pagination">*268</span> not affect a conditional commutation which was
            granted 12 years earlier.</p>
         <p>We are not moved by petitioner's argument that it is somehow "unfair" that he be treated
            differently from persons whose death sentences were pending at the time that Furman was
            decided. Individual acts of clemency inherently call for discriminating choices because
            no two cases are the same. Indeed, as noted earlier, petitioner's life was undoubtedly
            spared by President Eisenhower's commutation order of March 25, 1960. Nor is petitioner
            without further remedies since he may, of course, apply to the present President or
            future Presidents for a complete pardon, commutation to time served, or relief from the
            no-parole condition. We hold only that the conditional commutation of his death sentence
            was lawful when made and that intervening events have not altered its validity.</p>
         <p>Affirmed.</p></div>
      <div type="dissent" judge="marshall2"><p>MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS
            and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join, dissenting.</p>
         <p>The Court today denies petitioner relief from the no-parole condition of his commuted
            death sentence, paying only lip service to our intervening decision in Furman v.
            Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972). Because I believe the retrospective application of Furman
            requires us to vacate petitioner's sentence and substitute the only lawful alternative
            &#x97;life with the opportunity for parole, I respectfully dissent.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>The Court misconstrues petitioner's retroactivity argument. Schick does not dispute the
            constitutional validity of the death penalty in 1954 under then-existing case law. Nor
            does he contend that he was under sentence of death<span class="sup">[1]</span>
            <span class="star-pagination">*269</span> in 1972 when the decision issued in Furman,
            invalidating "the imposition and carrying out" of discretionary death sentences. Id., at
            239. Rather, he argues that the retroactive application of Furman to his no-parole
            commutation is required because the imposition of the death sentence was the
            indispensable vehicle through which he became subject to his present sentence. In other
            words, the no-parole condition could not now exist had the court-martial before which
            Schick was tried not imposed the death penalty.</p>
         <p>The relationship between the death sentence and the condition is clear. Article 118 of
            the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)<span class="sup">[2]</span> authorizes only
            two sentences for the crime of premeditated murder: death or life imprisonment which
            entails at least the possibility of parole. Confinement without possibility of parole is
            unknown to military law;<span class="sup">[3]</span> it is not and has never been
            authorized for any UCMJ offense, 10 U. S. C. §§ 877-934; Manual for Courts-Martial, 34
            Fed. Reg. 10502 (1969). In short, the penal restriction of the commutation was a
            creature of Presidential clemency made possible only <span class="star-pagination"
               >*270</span> through the court-martial's imposition of the death sentence.</p>
         <p>The retroactivity of Furman is equally unclouded. The Court "[has] not hesitated" to
            give full retroactive effect to the Furman decision. Robinson v. Neil, 409 U. S. 505,
            508 (1973). See Stewart v. Massachusetts, 408 U. S. 845 (1972); Marks v. Louisiana, 408
            U. S. 933 (1972); Walker v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 936 (1972). The per curiam decision
            struck down both "the imposition and the carrying out" of discretionary death sentences
            as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. 408 U. S., at 239.
            The opinion specifically held that the "judgment . . . is . . . reversed insofar as it
            leaves undisturbed the death sentence imposed . . . ." Id., at 240. The retroactive
            application of Furman results in more than the simple enjoining of execution; it
            nullifies the very act of sentencing. In effect a post-Furman court must ensure a
            prisoner the same treatment that he would have been afforded had the death penalty not
            been imposed initially.<span class="sup">[4]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The full retroactivity of a constitutional ruling is aimed at the eradication of all
            adverse consequences of prior violations of that rule. We have recognized the importance
            of erasing "root and branch" the adverse legal consequences, both direct and indirect,
            of prior constitutional violations. See, e. g., McConnell v. Rhay, 393 U. S. 2, 3
            (1968); Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618, 639 (1965). The effective operation of this
            procedure was demonstrated <span class="star-pagination">*271</span> in the decisions on
            the right to counsel in state felony trials. See Pickelsimer v. Wainwright, 375 U. S. 2
            (1963); Kitchens v. Smith, 401 U. S. 847 (1971); Burgett v. Texas, 389 U. S. 109 (1967);
            United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443 (1972).</p>
         <p>Since Furman is fully retroactive petitioner's case should be simple to resolve. The
            terms of Art. 118 of the UCMJ provide that a person convicted of premeditated murder
            "shall suffer death or imprisonment for life as a court-martial may direct." A death
            sentence was imposed by the court-martial and affirmed by the Board of Review and the
            United States Court of Military Appeals, 7 U. S. C. M. A. 419, 22 C. M. R. 209 (1956).
            The death sentence so imposed was declared unconstitutional by Furman and is therefore
            null and void as a matter of law. The only legal alternative&#x97;simple life
            imprisonment&#x97; must be substituted. Concomitantly, the adverse consequence of the
            death sentence&#x97;the no-parole condition of petitioner's 1960 commutation&#x97;must
            also be voided, as it exceeds the lawful alternative punishment that should have been
            imposed. Petitioner should now be subject to treatment as a person sentenced to life
            imprisonment on the date of his original sentence and eligible for parole.<span
               class="sup">[5]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*272</span> The Court today suggests that petitioner
            cannot claim any benefit from Furman because no death penalty was pending against him at
            the time of the decision. The 1960 commutation is touted as the panacea for the
            constitutional defects of petitioner's original sentence. Unfortunately, such is not the
            case.</p>
         <p>The imposition of the death sentence was the indispensable vehicle through which
            petitioner became subject to his present sentence. The commutation of the sentence did
            not cure the constitutional disabilities of the punishment. A noted expert on the
            subject of Presidential clemency states:</p> "Unlike a pardon, a commutation does not
         absolve the beneficiary from most of the legal consequences of an offense."<span
            class="sup">[6]</span>
         <p>Although petitioner is not under direct threat of the death sentence, "he has suffered
            and continues to suffer enhanced punishment&#x97;the loss of his statutory right to
               <span class="star-pagination">*273</span> be considered for parole&#x97;as a result
            of an illegally imposed death sentence"<span class="sup">[7]</span> The full
            retrospective application of Furman requires the eradication of this vestige of the
            prior constitutional violation. If petitioner had been granted stays of execution until
            Furman was decided, there is no doubt that his sentence would have to be vacated and a
            life sentence imposed instead. The situation should be no different simply because the
            Chief Executive commuted his sentence&#x97;in effect granting a permanent stay of
            execution. Nullification of the no-parole provision would relieve petitioner of this
            unconstitutional burden and clear the way for lawful resentencing with eligibility for
            parole.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>Since the majority devotes its opinion to a discussion of the scope of Presidential
            power, I am compelled to comment. I have no quarrel with the proposition that the source
            of the President's commutation power is found in Art. II, § 2, cl. 1, of the
            Constitution, which authorizes the President to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses
            against the United States except for cases of impeachment. Biddle v. Perovich, 274 U. S.
            480 (1927). Commutation is defined as the substitution of a lesser type of punishment
            for the punishment actually imposed at trial.<span class="sup">[8]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*274</span> The issue here is whether the President's
            expansion of an unencumbered life term by addition of a condition proscribing Schick's
            eligibility for parole went beyond the authority conferred by Art. II. Article 118 of
            the UCMJ and the implementing court-martial regulations prescribe mandatory adjudication
            of either death or life imprisonment for the crime of premeditated murder. 10 U. S. C. §
            918; 34 Fed. Reg. 10704. I take issue with the Court's conclusion that annexation of the
            "no-parole condition . . . does not offend the Constitution." Ante, at 267. In my view
            the President's action exceeded the limits of the Art. II pardon power. In commuting a
            sentence under Art. II the Chief Executive is not imbued with the constitutional power
            to create unauthorized punishments.</p>
         <p>The congressionally prescribed limits of punishment mark the boundaries within which the
            Executive must exercise his authority.<span class="sup">[9]</span> By virtue of the
            pardon power the Executive may abstain from enforcing a judgment by judicial
            authorities; he may not, under the aegis of that power, engage in lawmaking or
            adjudication. Cf. United States v. Benz, 282 U. S. 304, 311 (1931) (an act of clemency
            is an exercise of executive power which abridges the enforcement of the judgment, but
            does not alter it qua judgment); United States ex rel. Brazier v. Commissioner of
            Immigration, 5 F. 2d 162 (CA2 1924) (pardon power does not embrace right to bar
            congressionally prescribed deportation of prisoners).</p>
         <p>While the clemency function of the Executive in the <span class="star-pagination"
               >*275</span> federal criminal justice system<span class="sup">[10]</span> is
            consistent with the separation of powers, the attachment of punitive conditions to
            grants of clemency is not. Prescribing punishment is a prerogative reserved for the
            lawmaking branch of government, the legislature. As a consequence, President
            Eisenhower's addition to Schick's commutation of a condition that did not coincide with
            punishment prescribed by the legislature for any military crime,<span class="sup"
               >[11]</span> much less this specific offense, was a usurpation of a legislative
            function. While the exercise of the pardon power was proper, the imposition of this
            penal condition was not embraced by that power.<span class="sup">[12]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*276</span> The Court today advances the antecedent
            English pardon power and prior holdings of this Court in support of the legality of the
            no-parole condition. Neither body of law has established an Executive right to define
            extra-legislative punishments.<span class="sup">[13]</span> Nor does the historical
            status of the pardon power in England or analysis of prior non-penal conditions supply
            any relevance here.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>The English annals offer dubious support to the Court. The majority opinion recounts in
            copious detail the historical evolution of the pardon power in England. Ante, at
            260-262. See also Ex parte Wells, <span class="citation">

               </a>
            </span>, 309-313 (1856). The references to English statutes and cases are no more than
            dictum; as the Court itself admonishes, "the [pardon] power flows from the Constitution
            alone." Ante, at 266. Accordingly, the primary resource for analyzing the scope of Art.
            II is our own republican system of government. See Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297
            U. S. 233, 248-249 (1936). The separation of powers doctrine does not vest the Chief
            Executive with an unrestrained clemency power, supra, at 274-275, but views his
            functions as distinct from the other coordinate branches. Ante, at 262-264. The
            references to the early American experience are not dispositive.<span class="sup"
               >[14]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*277</span> Indeed, history recounts that even the pardon
            power of the King to "annex [a condition] to his bounty" was subject to statutory
            limitation. 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *401. As noted in the Wells case:</p> "The
         sovereign of England, with all the prerogatives of the crown, in granting a conditional
         pardon, cannot substitute a punishment which the law does not authorize." 18 How., at 323
         (McLean, J., dissenting). <p>Even the authority quoted by Blackstone in support of the
            proposition, 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown 547 (8th ed. 1824), does not actually
            support the suggestion of unlimited power in the King. In fact, the conditions discussed
            were either imposed pursuant to statute or of a nonpunitive nature. See Coles Case,
            Moore K. B. 466, 72 Eng. Rep. 700 (1597); E. Coke, A Commentary upon Littleton 274b
            (19th ed. 1832). The Court acknowledges instances in which statutory authority placed
            restrictions on the monarch's power. Ante, at 260. The critical role of statutes in the
            imposition of the condition of banishment on pardons of convicted felons was recognized
            in a letter addressed to a member of the House of Lords:</p> "There is hardly anything
         to be found respecting conditional pardons in the old English law-books; but the authority
         of the Crown to grant a conditional pardon in capital cases is . . . recognized in statute
         5 Geo. 4, c. 84, s. 2 . . . ." W. Forsyth, Cases and Opinions on Constitutional Law 460
         (1869). <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*278</span> The King's prerogative was thus not as broad
            as the majority's reading of Blackstone indicates. The great discretion available to the
            King to dispense mercy did not incorporate into the pardoning power the royal right to
            invade the legislative province of assessing punishments.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B</h2>
         <p>Contrary to the Court's suggestion, limitation of Executive action to the statutory
            framework is not undermined by earlier decisions of this Court. In Biddle v. Perovich,
            274 U. S. 480, 483 (1927), the Solicitor General expressly noted that "[a] commutation
            is the substitution of a milder punishment known to the law for the one inflicted by the
            court." Mr. Justice Holmes, writing for a unanimous Court, concluded on a related matter
            that consent to commutation was unnecessary since "[b]y common understanding
            imprisonment for life is a less penalty than death." Id., at 487. The Court held that
            the "only question is whether the substituted punishment was authorized by law . . . ."
            Ibid. While Holmes' specific reference is to the law of the Constitution, he then
            proceeds with a discussion of the statutory sanctions. Commutation to life imprisonment
            without any opportunity for parole would penalize the prisoner here beyond the terms of
            the UCMJ sanctions.</p>
         <p>The requirement that the substituted sentence be one provided by law is not hampered by
            Ex parte Wells, supra, in which this Court upheld conditional commutation from a death
            sentence to a simple life term. The validity of mitigation of a sentence without
            depriving the prisoner of any additional rights is not inconsistent with rejection of
            unauthorized penal conditions. In Wells the Court acknowledged that limitations on the
            pardon power mandated its exercise "according to law; that is, as it had been used in
            England, and these States." 18 How., at 310. Although the Wells Court was not faced with
            the question <span class="star-pagination">*279</span> whether all possible conditions
            were in the ambit of Art. II, it addressed the specific limitation on penal conditions
            attached to commutations:</p> "So, conditional pardons by the king do not permit
         transportation or exile as a commutable punishment, unless the same has been provided for
         by legislation." Id., at 313. <p>The remaining cases on which the Court relies to sustain
            the condition offer minimal support and are easily distinguished.<span class="sup"
               >[15]</span>
         </p>
         <p>In conclusion I note that where a President chooses to exercise his clemency power he
            should be mindful that</p> "[t]he punishment appropriate for the diverse federal
         offenses is a matter for the discretion of Congress, subject only to constitutional
         limitations, more particularly the Eighth Amendment." Bell v. United States, 349 U. S. 81,
         82 (1955). <p>See Ex parte United States, 242 U. S. 27, 42 (1916). The Congress has not
            delegated such authority to the President. I do not challenge the right of the President
            to issue pardons on nonpenal conditions, but, where the Executive elects to exercise the
            Presidential power for commutation the clear import of the Constitution mandates that
            the lesser punishment imposed be sanctioned by the legislature.<span class="sup"
               >[16]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*280</span> In sum, the no-parole condition is
            constitutionally defective in the face of the retrospective application of Furman and
            the extra-legal nature of the Executive action. I would nullify the condition, and
            direct the lower court to remand the case for resentencing to the only alternative

            essential to the use of banishment from the realm as a commutable punishment by the
            English Crown. Id., at 313. However, that conclusion was no more than dictum and is
            historically incorrect. Indeed, about the time that Wells was decided Parliament
            abolished banishment as a penalty in England, but the Crown retained and continued to
            exercise the power to annex such conditions to pardons. 11 Holdsworth, supra, n. 1, at

         <p>[6] In the Federalist No. 74 Hamilton enlarged on this point: </p>
         <p>"Humanity and good policy conspire to dictate, that the benign prerogative of pardoning
            should be as little as possible fettered or embarrassed. The criminal code of every
            country partakes so much of necessary severity, that without an easy access to
            exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt, justice would wear a countenance too
            sanguinary and cruel. As the sense of responsibility is always strongest in proportion
            as it is undivided, it may be inferred that a single man would be most ready to attend
            to the force of those motives, which might plead for a mitigation of the rigor of the
            law, and least apt to yield to considerations, which were calculated to shelter a fit
            object of its vengeance. The reflection, that the fate of a fellow creature depended on
            his sole fiat, would naturally inspire scrupulousness and caution: The dread of being
            accused of weakness or connivance would beget equal circumspection, though of a
            different kind." The <ref type="intent" num="74">Federalist</ref> No. 74, pp. 500-501 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).</p>

         <p>[3] Military prisoners incarcerated in federal penitentiaries are governed by the same
            parole statutes and regulations applicable to all federal prisoners. Under the federal
            parole eligibility statute, 18 U. S. C. §§ 4202-4203 (1970 ed. and Supp. II),
            petitioner, an inmate for 20 years at Lewisburg, now has satisfied the 15-year
            prerequisite for parole consideration. See 10 U. S. C. § 858. Likewise, if Schick had
            been confined in a military facility he would now be eligible for parole under 10 U. S.

         <p>[5] Nothing in Furman suggests that it is inapplicable to the military. The per curiam
            carves out no exceptions to the prohibition against discretionary death sentences. The
            opinions of the five-member majority recognize no basis for excluding the members of the
            Armed Forces from protection against this form of punishment. Even the list of four
            capital punishment statutes not affected by the Court's decision, provided by my Brother
            STEWART, does not include the federal military statutes. 408 U. S. 238, 307 (1972). Even
            more persuasive is the language of my Brother POWELL in dissent which states that
            "numerous provisions of . . . the Uniform Code of Military Justice are also voided."
            Id., at 417-418. </p>
         <p>Beyond the language of Furman the Court has made clear in Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86
            (1958), that the Eighth Amendment is applicable to the military. While the Court divided
            on the penal nature of the statute which provided additional sanctions for servicemen
            convicted of wartime desertion, there was no disagreement on the application of the
            Amendment.</p>
         <p>I would also note that the UCMJ, enacted in 1950, has by decision and practice
            incorporated the Bill of Rights and afforded its protection to the members of the Armed
            Forces. See, e. g., United States v. Tempia, 16 U. S. C. M. A. 629, 634, 37 C. M. R.
            249, 254 (1967); United States v. Jacoby, 11 U. S. C. M. A. 428, 430-431, 29 C. M. R.
            244, 246-247 (1960); United States v. Jobe, 10 U. S. C. M. A. 276, 279, 27 C. M. R. 350,
            353 (1959).</p>
         <p>The fact that a court-martial rather than a jury imposes the death sentence is
            irrelevant. In my view the penalty is equally severe, and in my view equally offensive
            to the Eighth Amendment for that reason, see Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S., at 314-374
            (MARSHALL, J., concurring). Moreover, the potential for abuse and discrimination with
            which my Brethren were concerned in Furman is as evident here as in the civilian
            courts.</p>
         <p>[6] W. Humbert, The Pardoning Power of the President 27 (1941).</p>
         <p>[7] 157 U. S. App. D. C. 263, 270, 483 F. 2d 1266, 1273 (1973) (Wright, J.,
            dissenting).</p>
         <p>[8] Although pardon and commutation emanate from the same source, they represent clearly
            distinct forms of clemency. Whereas commutation is a substitution of a milder form of
            punishment, pardon is an act of public conscience that relieves the recipient of all the
            legal consequences of the conviction. See, e. g., United States ex rel. Brazier v.
            Commissioner of Immigration, 5 F. 2d 162 (CA2 1924); Chapman v. Scott, 10 F. 2d 156, 159
            (Conn. 1925), aff'd, 10 F. 2d 690 (CA2), cert. denied, 270 U. S. 657 (1926); Note,

            supra, n. 6, at 27; Black's Law Dictionary 351, 1268-1269 (4th ed. 1968).</p>
         <p>[9] Indeed, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall expanded on the notion of separation of powers,
            stating: "[T]he power of punishment is vested in the legislative . . . department. It is
            the legislature . . . which is to define a crime, and ordain its punishment." United
            States v. Wiltberger, <span class="citation">

         <p>[10] Article 71 (a) of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. § 871 (a), outlines the Presidential role
            in the review of military convictions. </p>
         <p>With the exception of premeditated murder and felony murder the UCMJ authorizes
            punishment at the discretion of the court-martial. Thus, in the majority of cases the
            President would not be limited to only two alternatives but could commute to any lesser
            sentence than that imposed by the court-martial consistent with the statutory
            authorization. It is only in the face of the mandate of Art. 118, limiting the
            alternatives to death or life imprisonment with the possibility of parole, that the
            restriction to the statutory alternatives may appear at first blush unduly
            Draconian.</p>
         <p>[11] As already indicated, confinement without opportunity for parole is unknown to
            military law. See text accompanying n. 3, supra. Moreover, the only federal-law
            recognition of this punishment in a civilian context is found in the very limited
            no-parole provisions dealing with continuing narcotics enterprises. 21 U. S. C. § 848.
            Guided by the special nature of drug offenses and drug offenders the Congress enacted
            this narrow exception to universal eligibility for parole. See H. R. Rep. No. 2388, 84th
            Cong., 2d Sess., 4, 8, 11, 64 (1956).</p>

            </span> (1856), and an opinion of Attorney General Brownell, 41 Op. Atty. Gen. 251
            (1955), in support of the statement that "Presidents . . . have [frequently] exercised
            the power to pardon or commute sentences upon conditions that are not specifically
            authorized by statute." Ante, at 266. Wells involved the simple substitution of the
            lesser penalty of life imprisonment for death; no separate punitive condition was
            attached to the Executive action. A legal opinion from the Attorney General supplies
            reasoned interpretations but hardly bears the force of law.</p>
         <p>[13] The King's pardon power, from which the President's Art. II power derives, also was
            subject historically to statutory limitations. See Ex parte Wells, supra, at 312-313;
            id., at 322 (McLean, J., dissenting).</p>
         <p>[14] With few exceptions conditional pardons were not granted by state governors except
            where authorized by law, Ex parte Wells, supra, at 322 (McLean, J., dissenting). The
            Court's references to the Framers' writings on the pardon power fail to take account of
            the separation of powers doctrine so fervently embraced by the constitutional drafters.

            only referred in dictum to the possibility that the President could condition a pardon.

            </span> (1867), and Ex parte Grossman, 267 U. S. 87 (1925), the Court focused on the
            discretionary aspect of the pardon power which is here unchallenged. The emphasis was on
            the right of the President to grant a pardon to any criminal, for any offense, at any
            time. The question of conditional action was raised in only a tangential manner.</p>
         <p>[16] The Court likens the no-parole condition to "sanctions imposed by legislatures such
            as mandatory minimum sentences . . . ." The similarity is all too close, in my view.
            Indeed, it is precisely because the President has invaded the legislative domain that
            the condition must fail.</p>
