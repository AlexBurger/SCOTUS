         </span> (1959) DRAPER v. UNITED STATES. No. 136. <p>Supreme Court of United States.</p>
         Argued December 11, 1958. Decided January 26, 1959. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
         OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT. <p>Osmond K. Fraenkel argued the cause and filed a brief
            for petitioner.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*308</span> Leonard B. Sand argued the cause for the
            United States. On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General
            Anderson, Beatrice Rosenberg and Jerome M. Feit.</p>
         <p>MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
         <p>Petitioner was convicted of knowingly concealing and transporting narcotic drugs in
            Denver, Colorado, in violation of 35 Stat. 614, as amended, 21 U. S. C. § 174. His
            conviction was based in part on the use in evidence against him of two "envelopes
            containing [865 grains of] heroin" and a hypodermic syringe that had been taken from his
            person, following his arrest, by the arresting officer. Before the trial, he moved to
            suppress that evidence as having been secured through an unlawful search and seizure.
            After hearing, the District Court found that the arresting officer had probable cause to
            arrest petitioner without a warrant and that the subsequent search and seizure were
            therefore incident to a lawful arrest, and overruled the motion to suppress. 146 F.
            Supp. 689. At the subsequent trial, that evidence was offered and, over petitioner's
            renewed objection, was received in evidence, and the trial resulted, as we have said, in
            petitioner's conviction. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, 248 F. 2d 295,
            and certiorari was sought on the sole ground that the search and seizure violated the
            Fourth Amendment<span class="sup">[1]</span> and therefore the use of the heroin in
            evidence vitiated the conviction. We granted the writ to determine that question. 357 U.
            S. 935.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*309</span> The evidence offered at the hearing on the
            motion to suppress was not substantially disputed. It established that one Marsh, a
            federal narcotic agent with 29 years' experience, was stationed at Denver; that one
            Hereford had been engaged as a "special employee" of the Bureau of Narcotics at Denver
            for about six months, and from time to time gave information to Marsh regarding
            violations of the narcotic laws, for which Hereford was paid small sums of money, and
            that Marsh had always found the information given by Hereford to be accurate and
            reliable. On September 3, 1956, Hereford told Marsh that James Draper (petitioner)
            recently had taken up abode at a stated address in Denver and "was peddling narcotics to
            several addicts" in that city. Four days later, on September 7, Hereford told Marsh
            "that Draper had gone to Chicago the day before [September 6] by train [and] that he was
            going to bring back three ounces of heroin [and] that he would return to Denver either
            on the morning of the 8th of September or the morning of the 9th of September also by
            train." Hereford also gave Marsh a detailed physical description of Draper and of the
            clothing he was wearing,<span class="sup">[2]</span> and said that he would be carrying
            "a tan zipper bag," and that he habitually "walked real fast."</p>
         <p>On the morning of September 8, Marsh and a Denver police officer went to the Denver
            Union Station and kept watch over all incoming trains from Chicago, but they did not see
            anyone fitting the description that Hereford had given. Repeating the process on the
            morning of September 9, they saw a person, having the exact physical attributes and
            wearing the precise clothing described by Hereford, alight from an incoming Chicago
            train and <span class="star-pagination">*310</span> start walking "fast" toward the
            exit. He was carrying a tan zipper bag in his right hand and the left was thrust in his
            raincoat pocket. Marsh, accompanied by the police officer, overtook, stopped and
            arrested him. They then searched him and found the two "envelopes containing heroin"
            clutched in his left hand in his raincoat pocket, and found the syringe in the tan
            zipper bag. Marsh then took him (petitioner) into custody. Hereford died four days after
            the arrest and therefore did not testify at the hearing on the motion.</p>
         <p>26 U. S. C. (Supp. V) § 7607, added by § 104 (a) of the Narcotic Control Act of 1956, 70
            Stat. 570, provides, in pertinent part:</p> "The Commissioner . . . and agents, of the
         Bureau of Narcotics . . . may&#x97; ..... "(2) make arrests without warrant for violations
         of any law of the United States relating to narcotic drugs . . . where the violation is
         committed in the presence of the person making the arrest or where such person has
         reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing
         such violation." <p>The crucial question for us then is whether knowledge of the related
            facts and circumstances gave Marsh "probable cause" within the meaning of the Fourth
            Amendment, and "reasonable grounds" within the meaning of § 104 (a), supra,<span
               class="sup">[3]</span> to believe that petitioner had committed or was committing a
            violation of the narcotic laws. If it did, the arrest, though without a warrant, was
            lawful <span class="star-pagination">*311</span> and the subsequent search of
            petitioner's person and the seizure of the found heroin were validly made incident to a
            lawful arrest, and therefore the motion to suppress was properly overruled and the
            heroin was competently received in evidence at the trial. Weeks v. United States, 232 U.
            S. 383, 392; Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 158; Agnello v. United States, 269
            U. S. 20, 30; Giordenello v. United States, 357 U. S. 480, 483.</p>
         <p>Petitioner does not dispute this analysis of the question for decision. Rather, he
            contends (1) that the information given by Hereford to Marsh was "hearsay" and, because
            hearsay is not legally competent evidence in a criminal trial, could not legally have
            been considered, but should have been put out of mind, by Marsh in assessing whether he
            had "probable cause" and "reasonable grounds" to arrest petitioner without a warrant,
            and (2) that, even if hearsay could lawfully have been considered, Marsh's information
            should be held insufficient to show "probable cause" and "reasonable grounds" to believe
            that petitioner had violated or was violating the narcotic laws and to justify his
            arrest without a warrant.</p>
         <p>Considering the first contention, we find petitioner entirely in error. Brinegar v.
            United States, 338 U. S. 160, 172-173, has settled the question the other way. There, in
            a similar situation, the convict contended "that the factors relating to inadmissibility
            of the evidence [for] purposes of proving guilt at the trial, deprive[d] the evidence as
            a whole of sufficiency to show probable cause for the search . . . ." Id., at 172.
            (Emphasis added.) But this Court, rejecting that contention, said: "[T]he so-called
            distinction places a wholly unwarranted emphasis upon the criterion of admissibility in
            evidence, to prove the accused's guilt, of the facts relied upon to show probable cause.
            That emphasis, we think, goes much too far in confusing and disregarding the difference
            between what is required to prove guilt in a criminal case and what is <span
               class="star-pagination">*312</span> required to show probable cause for arrest or
            search. It approaches requiring (if it does not in practical effect require) proof
            sufficient to establish guilt in order to substantiate the existence of probable cause.
            There is a large difference between the two things to be proved [guilt and probable
            cause], as well as between the tribunals which determine them, and therefore a like
            difference in the quanta and modes of proof required to establish them."<span
               class="sup">[4]</span> 338 U. S., at 172-173.</p>
         <p>Nor can we agree with petitioner's second contention that Marsh's information was
            insufficient to show probable cause and reasonable grounds to believe that petitioner
            had violated or was violating the narcotic laws and to justify his arrest without a
            warrant. The information given to narcotic agent Marsh by "special employee" <span
               class="star-pagination">*313</span> Hereford may have been hearsay to Marsh, but
            coming from one employed for that purpose and whose information had always been found
            accurate and reliable, it is clear that Marsh would have been derelict in his duties had
            he not pursued it. And when, in pursuing that information, he saw a man, having the
            exact physical attributes and wearing the precise clothing and carrying the tan zipper
            bag that Hereford had described, alight from one of the very trains from the very place
            stated by Hereford and start to walk at a "fast" pace toward the station exit, Marsh had
            personally verified every facet of the information given him by Hereford except whether
            petitioner had accomplished his mission and had the three ounces of heroin on his person
            or in his bag. And surely, with every other bit of Hereford's information being thus
            personally verified, Marsh had "reasonable grounds" to believe that the remaining
            unverified bit of Hereford's information&#x97;that Draper would have the heroin with
            him&#x97;was likewise true.</p>
         <p>"In dealing with probable cause, . . . as the very name implies, we deal with
            probabilities. These are not technical; they are the factual and practical
            considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal
            technicians, act." Brinegar v. United States, supra, at 175. Probable cause exists where
            "the facts and circumstances within [the arresting officers'] knowledge and of which
            they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a
            man of reasonable caution in the belief that" an offense has been or is being committed.
            Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 162.<span class="sup">[5]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*314</span> We believe that, under the facts and
            circumstances here, Marsh had probable cause and reasonable grounds to believe that
            petitioner was committing a violation of the laws of the United States relating to
            narcotic drugs at the time he arrested him. The arrest was therefore lawful, and the
            subsequent search and seizure, having been made incident to that lawful arrest, were
            likewise valid.<span class="sup">[6]</span> It follows that petitioner's motion to
            suppress was properly denied and that the seized heroin was competent evidence lawfully
            received at the trial.</p>
         <p>Affirmed.</p>
         <p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or
            decision of this case.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="dissent" judge="douglas"><p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.</p>
         <p>Decisions under the Fourth Amendment,<span class="sup">[1]</span> taken in the long
            view, have not given the protection to the citizen which the letter and spirit of the
            Amendment would seem to require. One reason, I think, is that wherever a culprit is
            caught red-handed, as in leading Fourth Amendment cases, it is difficult to adopt and
            enforce a rule that would turn him loose. A rule protective of law-abiding citizens is
            not apt to flourish where its advocates are usually criminals. Yet the rule we fashion
            is for the innocent and guilty alike. If the word of the informer <span
               class="star-pagination">*315</span> on which the present arrest was made is
            sufficient to make the arrest legal, his word would also protect the police who, acting
            on it, hauled the innocent citizen off to jail.</p>
         <p>Of course, the education we receive from mystery stories and television shows teaches
            that what happened in this case is efficient police work. The police are tipped off that
            a man carrying narcotics will step off the morning train. A man meeting the precise
            description does alight from the train. No warrant for his arrest has been&#x97;or, as I
            see it, could then be&#x97;obtained. Yet he is arrested; and narcotics are found in his
            pocket and a syringe in the bag he carried. This is the familiar pattern of crime
            detection which has been dinned into public consciousness as the correct and efficient
            one. It is, however, a distorted reflection of the constitutional system under which we
            are supposed to live.</p>
         <p>With all due deference, the arrest made here on the mere word of an informer violated
            the spirit of the Fourth Amendment and the requirement of the law, 26 U. S. C. (Supp. V)
            § 7607, governing arrests in narcotics cases. If an arrest is made without a warrant,
            the offense must be committed in the presence of the officer or the officer must have
            "reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is
            committing" a violation of the narcotics law. The arresting officers did not have a bit
            of evidence, known to them and as to which they could take an oath had they gone to a
            magistrate for a warrant, that petitioner had committed any crime. The arresting
            officers did not know the grounds on which the informer based his conclusion; nor did
            they seek to find out what they were. They acted solely on the informer's word. In my
            view that was not enough.</p>
         <p>The rule which permits arrest for felonies, as distinguished from misdemeanors, if there
            are reasonable grounds for believing a crime has been or is being committed (Carroll v.
            United States, 267 U. S. 132, 157), <span class="star-pagination">*316</span> grew out
            of the need to protect the public safety by making prompt arrests. Id. Yet, apart from
            those cases where the crime is committed in the presence of the officer, arrests without
            warrants, like searches without warrants, are the exception, not the rule in our
            society. Lord Chief Justice Pratt in Wilkes v. Wood, 19 How. St. Tr. 1153, condemned not
            only the odious general warrant,<span class="sup">[2]</span> in which the name of the
            citizen to be arrested was left blank, but the whole scheme of seizures and
               searches<span class="sup">[3]</span> under "a discretionary power" of law officers to
            act "wherever their suspicions may chance to fall"&#x97;a practice which he denounced as
            "totally subversive of the liberty of the subject." Id., at 1167. See III May,
            Constitutional History of England, c. XI. Wilkes had written in 1762, "To take any man
            into custody, and deprive him of his liberty, without having some seeming foundation at
            least, on which to justify such a step, is inconsistent with wisdom and sound policy."
            The Life and Political Writings of John Wilkes, p. 372.</p>
         <p>George III in 1777 pressed for a bill which would allow arrests on suspicion of treason
            committed in America. The words were "suspected of" treason and it was to these words
            that Wilkes addressed himself in Parliament. "There is not a syllable in the Bill of the
            degree of probability attending the suspicion. . . . Is it possible, Sir, to give more
            despotic powers to a bashaw of the Turkish <span class="star-pagination">*317</span>
            empire? What security is left for the devoted objects of this Bill against the malice of
            a prejudiced individual, a wicked magistrate . . . ?" The Speeches of Mr. Wilkes, p.
            102.</p>
         <p>These words and the complaints against which they were directed were will known on this
            side of the water. Hamilton wrote about "the practice of arbitrary imprisonments" which
            he denounced as "the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny." The
            <ref type="treatise" num="84">Federalist</ref> No. 84. The writs of assistance, against which James Otis proclaimed,<span
               class="sup">[4]</span> were vicious in the same way as the general warrants, since
            they required no showing of "probable cause" before a magistrate, and since they allowed
            the police to search on suspicion and without "reasonable grounds" for believing that a
            crime had been or was being committed. Otis' protest was eloquent; but he lost the case.
            His speech, however, rallied public opinion. "Then and there," wrote John Adams, "the
            child Independence was born." 10 Life and Works of John Adams (1856), p. 248.</p>
         <p>The attitude of Americans to arrests and searches on suspicion was also greatly
            influenced by the lettres de cachet extensively used in France.<span class="sup"
               >[5]</span> This was an order emanating from the King and countersigned by a minister
            directing the seizure of a person for purposes of immediate imprisonment or exile. The
            ministers issued the lettres in an arbitrary manner, often at the request of the head of
            a noble family to punish a deviant son or relative. See Mirabeau, A Victim of the
            Lettres de Cachet, 3 Am. Hist. Rev. 19. One who was so arrested <span
               class="star-pagination">*318</span> might remain incarcerated indefinitely, as no
            legal process was available by which he could seek release. "Since the action of the
            government was secret, his friends might not know whither he had vanished, and he might
            even be ignorant of the cause of his arrest." 8 The Camb. Mod. Hist. 50. In the
            Eighteenth Century the practice arose of issuing the lettres in blank, the name to be
            filled in by the local mandatory. Thus the King could be told in 1770 "that no citizen
            of your realm is guaranteed against having his liberty sacrificed to revenge. For no one
            is great enough to be beyond the hate of some minister, nor small enough to be beyond
            the hate of some clerk." III Encyc. Soc. Sci. 138. As Blackstone wrote, ". . . if once
            it were left in the power of any, the highest, magistrate to imprison arbitrarily
            whomever he or his officers thought proper, (as in France it is daily practiced by the
            crown,) there would soon be an end of all other rights and immunities." I Commentaries
            (4th ed. Cooley) *135.</p>
         <p>The Virginia Declaration of Rights, adopted June 12, 1776, included the forerunner of
            the Fourth Amendment:<span class="sup">[6]</span>
         </p> "That general warrants, whereby an officer or messenger may be commanded to search
         suspected places without evidence of a fact committed, or to seize any person or persons
         not named, or whose offence is not particularly described and supported by evidence, are
         grievous and oppressive, and ought not to be granted." (Italics added.) <p>The requirement
            that a warrant of arrest be "supported by evidence" was by then deeply rooted in
            history. And it is inconceivable that in those days, when the right of <span
               class="star-pagination">*319</span> privacy was so greatly cherished, the mere word
            of an informer&#x97;such as we have in the present case&#x97;would be enough. For
            whispered charges and accusations, used in lieu of evidence of unlawful acts, were the
            main complaint of the age. Frisbie v. Butler, Kirby's Rep. (Conn.) 1785-1788, p. 213,
            decided in 1787, illustrates, I think, the mood of the day in the matter of arrests on
            suspicion. A warrant of arrest and search was issued by a justice of the peace on the
            oath of a citizen who had lost some pork from a cellar, the warrant stating, "said
            Butler suspects one Benjamin Frisbie, of Harwinton, to be the person that hath taken
            said pork." The court on appeal reversed the judgment of conviction, holding inter alia
            that the complaint "contained no direct charge of the theft, but only an averment that
            the defendant was suspected to be guilty." Id., at 215. Nothing but suspicion is shown
            in the instant case&#x97;suspicion of an informer, not that of the arresting officers.
            Nor did they seek to obtain from the informer any information on which he based his
            belief. The arresting officers did not have a bit of evidence that the petitioner had
            committed or was committing a crime before the arrest. The only evidence of guilt was
            provided by the arrest itself.</p>
         <p>When the Constitution was up for adoption, objections were made that it contained no
            Bill of Rights. And Patrick Henry was one who complained in particular that it contained
            no provision against arbitrary searches and seizures:</p> ". . . general warrants, by
         which an officer may search suspected places, without evidence of the commission of a fact,
         or seize any person without evidence of his crime, ought to be prohibited. As these are
         admitted, any man may be seized, any property may be taken, in the most arbitrary manner,
         without any evidence or reason. Every thing the most sacred <span class="star-pagination"
            >*320</span> may be searched and ransacked by the strong hand of power. We have
         infinitely more reason to dread general warrants here than they have in England, because
         there, if a person be confined, liberty may be quickly obtained by the writ of habeas
         corpus. But here a man living many hundred miles from the judges may get in prison before
         he can get that writ." I Elliot's Debates 588. <p>The determination that arrests and
            searches on mere suspicion would find no place in American law enforcement did not abate
            following the adoption of a Bill of Rights applicable to the Federal Government. In
            Conner v. Commonwealth, 3 Binn. (Pa.) 38, an arrest warrant issued by a magistrate
            stating his "strong reason to suspect" that the accused had committed a crime because of
            "common rumor and report" was held illegal under a constitutional provision identical in
            relevant part to the Fourth Amendment. "It is true, that by insisting on an oath, felons
            may sometimes escape. This must have been very well known to the framers of our
            constitution; but they thought it better that the guilty should sometimes escape, than
            that every individual should be subject to vexation and oppression." Id., at 43-44. In
            Grumon v. Raymond, <span class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">1</span>

            </span>, the warrant stated that "several persons are suspected" of stealing some flour
            which is concealed in Hyatt's house or somewhere else, and ordered the constable to
            search Hyatt's house or other places and arrest the suspected persons if found with the
            flour. The court held the warrant void, stating it knew of "no such process as one to
            arrest all suspected persons, and bring them before a court for trial. It is an idea not
            to be endured for a moment." Id., at 44. See also Fisher v. McGirr, 1 Gray (Mass.) 1;
            Lippman v. People, 175 III. 101, 51 N. E. 872; Somerville v. Richards, 37 Mich. 299;

         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*321</span> It was against this long background that
            Professors Hogan and Snee of Georgetown University recently wrote:</p> ". . . it must be
         borne in mind that any arrest based on suspicion alone is illegal. This indisputable rule
         of law has grave implications for a number of traditional police investigative practices.
         The round-up or dragnet arrest, the arrest on suspicion, for questioning, for investigation
         or on an open charge all are prohibited by the law. It is undeniable that if those arrests
         were sanctioned by law, the police would be in a position to investigate a crime and to
         detect the real culprit much more easily, much more efficiently, much more economically,
         and with much more dispatch. It is equally true, however, that society cannot confer such
         power on the police without ripping away much of the fabric of a way of life which seeks to
         give the maximum of liberty to the individual citizen. The finger of suspicion is a long
         one. In an individual case it may point to all of a certain race, age group or locale.
         Commonly it extends to any who have committed similar crimes in the past. Arrest on mere
         suspicion collides violently with the basic human right of liberty. It can be tolerated
         only in a society which is willing to concede to its government powers which history and
         experience teach are the inevitable accoutrements of tyranny." 47 Geo. L. J. 1, 22. <p>Down
            to this day our decisions have closely heeded that warning. So far as I can ascertain
            the mere word of an informer, not bolstered by some evidence<span class="sup">[7]</span>
            that a <span class="star-pagination">*322</span> crime had been or was being committed,
            has never been approved by this Court as "reasonable grounds" for making an arrest
            without a warrant. Whether the act complained of be seizure of goods, search of
            premises, or the arrest of the citizen, the judicial inquiry has been directed toward
            the reasonableness of inferences to be drawn from suspicious circumstances attending the
            action thought to be unlawful. Evidence required to prove guilt is not necessary. But
            the attendant circumstances must be sufficient to give rise in the mind of the arresting
            officer at least to inferences of guilt. Locke v. United States, 7 Cranch 339; The
            Thompson, 3 Wall. 155; Stacey v. Emery, 97 U. S. 642; Director General v. Kastenbaum,
            263 U. S. 25; Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 159-162; United States v. Di Re,
            332 U. S. 581, 591-592; Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 165-171.</p>
         <p>The requirement that the arresting officer know some facts suggestive of guilt has been
            variously stated:</p> "If the facts and circumstances before the officer are such as to
         warrant a man of prudence and caution in believing that the offense has been committed, it
         is sufficient." Stacey v. Emery, supra, at 645. ". . . good faith is not enough to
         constitute probable cause. That faith must be grounded on facts within knowledge of the . .
         . agent, which in the judgment of the court would make his faith reasonable." Director
         General v. Kastenbaum, supra, at 28. <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*323</span> Even when officers had information far more
            suggestive of guilt than the word of the informer used here, we have not sustained
            arrests without a warrant. In Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10, 16, the arresting
            officer not only had an informer's tip but he actually smelled opium coming out of a
            room; and on breaking in found the accused. That arrest was held unlawful. Yet the smell
            of opium is far more tangible direct evidence than an unverified report that someone is
            going to commit a crime. And in United States v. Di Re, supra, an arrest without a
            warrant of a man sitting in a car, where counterfeit coupons had been found passing
            between two men, was not justified in absence of any shred of evidence implicating the
            defendant, a third person. And see Giacona v. State, 164 Tex. Cr. R. 325, 298 S. W. 2d
            587. Yet the evidence before those officers was more potent than the mere word of the
            informer involved in the present case.</p>
         <p>The Court is quite correct in saying that proof of "reasonable grounds" for believing a
            crime was being committed need not be proof admissible at the trial. It could be
            inferences from suspicious acts, e. g., consort with known peddlers, the surreptitious
            passing of a package, an intercepted message suggesting criminal activities, or any
            number of such events coming to the knowledge of the officer. See People v. Rios, <span
               class="citation">

            </span>, 294 P. 2d 39. But, if he takes the law into his own hands and does not seek the
            protection of a warrant, he must act on some evidence known to him.<span class="sup"
               >[8]</span> The law goes for to protect <span class="star-pagination">*324</span> the
            citizen. Even suspicious acts observed by the officers may be as consistent with
            innocence as with guilt. That is not enough, for even the guilty may not be implicated
            on suspicion alone. Baumboy v. United States, 24 F. 2d 512. The reason is, as I have
            said, that the standard set by the Constitution and by the statute is one that will
            protect both the officer and the citizen. For if the officer acts with "probable cause"
            or on "reasonable grounds," he is protected even though the citizen is innocent.<span
               class="sup">[9]</span> This important requirement should be strictly enforced, lest
            the whole process of arrest revert once more to whispered accusations by people. When we
            lower the guards as we do today, we risk making the role of the informer&#x97;odious in
            our history&#x97;once more supreme. I think the correct rule was stated in Poldo v.
            United States, 55 F. 2d 866, 869. "Mere suspicion is not enough; there must be
            circumstances represented to the officers through the testimony of their senses
            sufficient to justify them in a good-faith belief that the defendant had violated the
            law."</p>
         <p>Here the officers had no evidence&#x97;apart from the mere word of an informer&#x97;that
            petitioner was committing a crime. The fact that petitioner walked fast and carried a
            tan zipper bag was not evidence of any crime. The officers knew nothing except what they
            had been told by the informer. If they went to a magistrate to get a warrant of arrest
            and relied solely on the report of the informer, it is not conceivable to me that one
            would be granted. See Giordenello v. United States, 357 U. S. 480, 486. For they could
            not present to the magistrate any of the facts which the informer may have had. They
            could swear only to the fact that the informer had made the accusation. They could swear
            to no evidence that lay in their own knowledge. They could <span class="star-pagination"
               >*325</span> present, on information and belief, no facts which the informer
            disclosed. No magistrate could issue a warrant on the mere word of an officer, without
               more.<span class="sup">[10]</span> See Giordenello v. United States, supra. We are
            not justified in lowering the standard when an arrest is made without a warrant and
            allowing the officers more leeway than we grant the magistrate.</p>
         <p>With all deference I think we break with tradition when we sustain this arrest. We said
            in United States v. Di Re, supra, at 595, ". . . a search is not to be made legal by
            what it turns up. In law it is good or bad when it starts and does not change character
            from its success." In this case it was only after the arrest and search were made that
            there was a shred of evidence known to the officers that a crime was in the process of
            being committed.<span class="sup">[11]</span>

            on information from others, they must make that information, so far as they can, their
            own. He puts a case where A, suspecting B "on reasonable grounds" of being a felon, asks
            an officer to arrest B. The duty of the officer was stated as follows: </p>
         <p>"He ought to inquire and examine the circumstances and causes of the suspicion of A.
            which tho he cannot do it upon oath, yet such an information may carry over the

            </span>, 4 P. 363; State v. Smith, 262 S. W. 65 (Mo. App.), arising under state
            constitutions having provisions comparable to our Fourth Amendment.</p>
         <p>[11] The Supreme Court of South Carolina has said: </p>
         <p>"Some things are to be more deplored than the unlawful transportation of whiskey; one is
            the loss of liberty. Common as the event may be, it is a serious thing to arrest a
            citizen, and it is a more serious thing to search his person; and he who accomplishes
            it, must do so in conformity to the laws of the land. There are two reasons for this:
            one to avoid bloodshed, and the other to preserve the liberty of the citizen. Obedience
            to law is the bond of society, and the officers set to enforce the law are not exempt
            from its mandates.</p>
         <p>"In the instant case the possession of the liquor was the body of the offense; that fact
            was proven by a forcible and unlawful search of the defendant's person to secure the
            veritable key to the offense. It is fundamental that a citizen may not be arrested and
            have his person searched by force and without process in order to secure testimony
            against him. . . . It is better that the guilty shall escape, rather than another
            offense shall be committed in the proof of guilt." Town of Blacksburg v. Beam, 104 S. C.
            146, 148, 88 S. E. 441.</p>
