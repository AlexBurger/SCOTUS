         </span> (1925) EX PARTE GRUBER. No. ___. Original. <p>Supreme Court of United States.</p>
         Motion for leave to file petition for mandamus, November 23, 1925. Decided December 14,
         1925. <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*303</span> Mr. Marcus Gruber, pro se.</p>
         <p>MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
         <p>This is an application for leave to file a petition and for a rule directing Albert
            Halstead, Consul General of the United States at Montreal, Canada, to show cause why a
            writ of mandamus should not issue commanding him to visa the passport or the certificate
            of origin and identity presented to him by one Rosa Porter, a citizen of Russia, who
            recently arrived in Montreal from Russia and from whom petitioner, a relative, desires a
            visit in the United States of several months' duration. We do not review the averments
            of the petition, since, other questions aside, it is clear that this court is without
            original jurisdiction.</p>
         <p>Article III, ยง 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution provides that this court shall have
            original jurisdiction "in all cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and
            Consuls." Manifestly, this refers to diplomatic and consular representatives accredited
            to the United States by foreign powers, not to those representing this country abroad.
            Milward v. McSaul, 17 Fed. Cas. 425, 426, No. 9624. The provision, no doubt, was
            inserted in view of the important and sometimes delicate nature of our relations and
            intercourse with foreign governments. It is a privilege, not of the official, but of the
            sovereign or government which he represents, accorded from high considerations of public
            policy, considerations which plainly do not apply to the United States in its own
            territory. See generally Davis v. <span class="star-pagination">*304</span> Packard,

         <p>The application is denied for want of original jurisdiction.</p>
