         </span> (1958) TROP v. DULLES, SECRETARY OF STATE, ET AL. No. 70. <p>Supreme Court of
            United States.</p> Argued May 2, 1957. Restored to the calendar for reargument June 24,
         1957. Reargued October 28-29, 1957. Decided March 31, 1958. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES
         COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT. <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*87</span> Osmond K. Fraenkel argued the cause and filed
            the briefs for petitioner.</p>
         <p>Oscar H. Davis argued the cause for respondents on the original argument, and Solicitor
            General Rankin on the reargument. With them on the briefs were Warren Olney, III, then
            Assistant Attorney General, and J. F. Bishop. Beatrice Rosenberg was also with them on
            the brief on the reargument.</p>
         <p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion,
            in which MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join.</p>
         <p>The petitioner in this case, a native-born American, is declared to have lost his United
            States citizenship and become stateless by reason of his conviction by court-martial for
            wartime desertion. As in Perez v. Brownell, ante, p. 44, the issue before us is whether
            this forfeiture of citizenship comports with the Constitution.</p>
         <p>The facts are not in dispute. In 1944 petitioner was a private in the United States
            Army, serving in French Morocco. On May 22, he escaped from a stockade at Casablanca,
            where he had been confined following a previous breach of discipline. The next day
            petitioner and a companion were walking along a road towards Rabat, in the general
            direction back to Casablanca, when an Army truck approached and stopped. A witness
            testified that petitioner boarded the truck willingly and that no words were spoken. In
            Rabat petitioner was turned over to military police. Thus ended petitioner's
            "desertion." He had been gone less than a day and had willingly surrendered to an
            officer on an Army vehicle while he was walking back towards his base. He testified that
            at the <span class="star-pagination">*88</span> time he and his companion were picked up
            by the Army truck, "we had decided to return to the stockade. The going was tough. We
            had no money to speak of, and at the time we were on foot and we were getting cold and
            hungry." A general court-martial convicted petitioner of desertion and sentenced him to
            three years at hard labor, forfeiture of all pay and allowances and a dishonorable
            discharge.</p>
         <p>In 1952 petitioner applied for a passport. His application was denied on the ground that
            under the provisions of Section 401 (g) of the Nationality Act of 1940, as amended,<span
               class="sup">[1]</span> he had lost his citizenship by reason of his conviction and
            dishonorable discharge for wartime desertion. In 1955 petitioner commenced this action
            in the District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that he is a citizen. The
            Government's motion for summary judgment was granted, and the Court of Appeals for the
            Second Circuit affirmed, Chief Judge Clark dissenting. 239 F. 2d 527. We granted
            certiorari. 352 U. S. 1023.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*89</span> Section 401 (g), the statute that decrees the
            forfeiture of this petitioner's citizenship, is based directly on a Civil War statute,
            which provided that a deserter would lose his "rights of citizenship."<span class="sup"
               >[2]</span> The meaning of this phrase was not clear.<span class="sup">[3]</span>
            When the 1940 codification and revision of the nationality laws was prepared, the Civil
            War statute was amended to make it certain that what a convicted deserter would lose was
            nationality itself.<span class="sup">[4]</span> In 1944 the <span
               class="star-pagination">*90</span> statute was further amended to provide that a
            convicted deserter would lose his citizenship only if he was dismissed from the service
            or dishonorably discharged.<span class="sup">[5]</span> At the same time it was provided
            that citizenship could be regained if the deserter was restored to active duty in
            wartime with the permission of the military authorities.</p>
         <p>Though these amendments were added to ameliorate the harshness of the statute,<span
               class="sup">[6]</span> their combined effect produces a result that poses far graver
            problems than the ones that were sought to be solved. Section 401 (g) as amended now
            gives the military authorities complete discretion to decide who among convicted
            deserters shall continue to be Americans and who shall be stateless. By deciding whether
            to issue and execute a dishonorable discharge and whether to allow a deserter to
            re-enter the armed forces, the military becomes the arbiter of citizenship. And the
            domain given to it by Congress is not as narrow as might be supposed. Though the crime
            of desertion is one of the most serious in military law, it is by no means a rare event
            for a soldier to be convicted of this crime. The elements of desertion are simply
            absence from duty plus the intention not to return.<span class="sup">[7]</span> Into
            this <span class="star-pagination">*91</span> category falls a great range of conduct,
            which may be prompted by a variety of motives&#x97;fear, laziness, hysteria or any
            emotional imbalance. The offense may occur not only in combat but also in training camps
            for draftees in this country.<span class="sup">[8]</span> The Solicitor General informed
            the Court that during World War II, according to Army estimates, approximately 21,000
            soldiers and airmen were convicted of desertion and given dishonorable discharges by the
            sentencing courts-martial and that about 7,000 of these were actually separated from the
            service and thus rendered stateless when the reviewing authorities refused to remit
            their dishonorable discharges. Over this group of men, enlarged by whatever the
            corresponding figures may be for the Navy and Marines, the military has been given the
            power to grant or withhold citizenship. And the number of youths subject to this power
            could easily be enlarged simply by expanding the statute to cover crimes other than
            desertion. For instance, a dishonorable discharge itself might in the future be declared
            to be sufficient to justify forfeiture of citizenship.</p>
         <p>Three times in the past three years we have been confronted with cases presenting
            important questions bearing on the proper relationship between civilian and military
            authority in this country.<span class="sup">[9]</span> A statute such as Section 401 (g)
            raises serious issues in this area, but in our view of this case it is unnecessary to
            deal with those problems. We conclude that the judgment in this case must be reversed
            for the following reasons.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I.</h2>
         <p>In Perez v. Brownell, supra, I expressed the principles that I believe govern the
            constitutional status of United <span class="star-pagination">*92</span> States
            citizenship. It is my conviction that citizenship is not subject to the general powers
            of the National Government and therefore cannot be divested in the exercise of those
            powers. The right may be voluntarily relinquished or abandoned either by express
            language or by language and conduct that show a renunciation of citizenship.</p>
         <p>Under these principles, this petitioner has not lost his citizenship. Desertion in
            wartime, though it may merit the ultimate penalty, does not necessarily signify
            allegiance to a foreign state. Section 401 (g) is not limited to cases of desertion to
            the enemy, and there is no such element in this case. This soldier committed a crime for
            which he should be and was punished, but he did not involve himself in any way with a
            foreign state. There was no dilution of his allegiance to this country. The fact that
            the desertion occurred on foreign soil is of no consequence. The Solicitor General
            acknowledged that forfeiture of citizenship would have occurred if the entire incident
            had transpired in this country.</p>
         <p>Citizenship is not a license that expires upon misbehavior. The duties of citizenship
            are numerous, and the discharge of many of these obligations is essential to the
            security and well-being of the Nation. The citizen who fails to pay his taxes or to
            abide by the laws safeguarding the integrity of elections deals a dangerous blow to his
            country. But could a citizen be deprived of his nationality for evading these basic
            responsibilities of citizenship? In time of war the citizen's duties include not only
            the military defense of the Nation but also full participation in the manifold
            activities of the civilian ranks. Failure to perform any of these obligations may cause
            the Nation serious injury, and, in appropriate circumstances, the punishing power is
            available to deal with derelictions of duty. But citizenship is not lost every time a
            duty of citizenship is shirked. And the deprivation of citizenship <span
               class="star-pagination">*93</span> is not a weapon that the Government may use to
            express its displeasure at a citizen's conduct, however reprehensible that conduct may
            be. As long as a person does not voluntarily renounce or abandon his citizenship, and
            this petitioner has done neither, I believe his fundamental right of citizenship is
            secure. On this ground alone the judgment in this case should be reversed.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II.</h2>
         <p>Since a majority of the Court concluded in Perez v. Brownell that citizenship may be
            divested in the exercise of some governmental power, I deem it appropriate to state
            additionally why the action taken in this case exceeds constitutional limits, even under
            the majority's decision in Perez. The Court concluded in Perez that citizenship could be
            divested in the exercise of the foreign affairs power. In this case, it is urged that
            the war power is adequate to support the divestment of citizenship. But there is a vital
            difference between the two statutes that purport to implement these powers by decreeing
            loss of citizenship. The statute in Perez decreed loss of citizenship&#x97;so the
            majority concluded&#x97; to eliminate those international problems that were thought to
            arise by reason of a citizen's having voted in a foreign election. The statute in this
            case, however, is entirely different. Section 401 (g) decrees loss of citizenship for
            those found guilty of the crime of desertion. It is essentially like Section 401 (j) of
            the Nationality Act, decreeing loss of citizenship for evading the draft by remaining
            outside the United States.<span class="sup">[10]</span> This provision <span
               class="star-pagination">*94</span> was also before the Court in Perez, but the
            majority declined to consider its validity. While Section 401 (j) decrees loss of
            citizenship without providing any semblance of procedural due process whereby the guilt
            of the draft evader may be determined before the sanction is imposed, Section 401 (g),
            the provision in this case, accords the accused deserter at least the safeguards of an
            adjudication of guilt by a court-martial.</p>
         <p>The constitutional question posed by Section 401 (g) would appear to be whether or not
            denationalization may be inflicted as a punishment, even assuming that citizenship may
            be divested pursuant to some governmental power. But the Government contends that this
            statute does not impose a penalty and that constitutional limitations on the power of
            Congress to punish are therefore inapplicable. We are told this is so because a
            committee of Cabinet members, in recommending this legislation to the Congress, said it
            "technically is not a penal law."<span class="sup">[11]</span> How simple would be the
            tasks of constitutional adjudication and of law generally if specific problems could be
            solved by inspection of the labels pasted on them! Manifestly the issue of whether
            Section 401 (g) is a penal law cannot be thus determined. Of course it is relevant to
            know the classification employed by the Cabinet Committee that played such an important
            role in the preparation of the Nationality Act of 1940. But it is equally relevant to
            know that this very committee acknowledged that Section 401 (g) was based on the
            provisions of the 1865 Civil War statute, which the committee itself termed "distinctly
            penal in character."<span class="sup">[12]</span> Furthermore, the 1865 <span
               class="star-pagination">*95</span> statute states in terms that deprivation of the
            rights of citizenship is "in addition to the other lawful penalties of the crime of
            desertion . . . ."<span class="sup">[13]</span> And certainly it is relevant to know
            that the reason given by the Senate Committee on Immigration as to why loss of
            nationality under Section 401 (g) can follow desertion only after conviction by
            court-martial was "because the penalty is so drastic."<span class="sup">[14]</span>
            Doubtless even a clear legislative classification of a statute as "non-penal" would not
            alter the fundamental nature of a plainly penal statute.<span class="sup">[15]</span>
            With regard to Section 401 (g) the fact is that the views of the Cabinet Committee and
            of the Congress itself as to the nature of the statute are equivocal, and cannot
            possibly provide the answer to our inquiry. Determination of whether this statute is a
            penal law requires careful consideration.</p>
         <p>In form Section 401 (g) appears to be a regulation of nationality. The statute deals
            initially with the status of nationality and then specifies the conduct that will result
            in loss of that status. But surely form cannot provide the answer to this inquiry. A
            statute providing that "a person shall lose his liberty by committing bank robbery,"
            though in form a regulation of liberty, would nonetheless be penal. Nor would its penal
            effect be altered by labeling it a regulation of banks or by arguing that there is a
            rational connection between safeguarding banks and imprisoning bank robbers. The inquiry
            must be directed to substance.</p>
         <p>This Court has been called upon to decide whether or not various statutes were penal
            ever since 1798. Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386. Each time a statute has been challenged as
            being in conflict with the constitutional prohibitions against bills of attainder and ex
            post facto <span class="star-pagination">*96</span> laws,<span class="sup">[16]</span>
            it has been necessary to determine whether a penal law was involved, because these
            provisions apply only to statutes imposing penalties.<span class="sup">[17]</span> In
            deciding whether or not a law is penal, this Court has generally based its determination
            upon the purpose of the statute.<span class="sup">[18]</span> If the statute imposes a
            disability for the purposes of punishment &#x97;that is, to reprimand the wrongdoer, to
            deter others, etc.&#x97;it has been considered penal.<span class="sup">[19]</span> But a
            statute has been considered nonpenal if it imposes a disability, not to punish, but to
            accomplish some other legitimate governmental purpose.<span class="sup">[20]</span> The
            Court has recognized that any statute decreeing some adversity as a consequence of
            certain conduct may have both a penal and a nonpenal effect. The controlling nature of
            such statutes normally depends on the evident purpose of the legislature. The point may
            be illustrated by the situation of an ordinary felon. A person who commits a bank
            robbery, for instance, loses his right to liberty and often his right to vote.<span
               class="sup">[21]</span> If, in the exercise of the power to protect banks, both
            sanctions were imposed for the purpose of punishing bank robbers, the statutes
            authorizing both disabilities would be penal. But because the purpose of <span
               class="star-pagination">*97</span> the latter statute is to designate a reasonable
            ground of eligibility for voting, this law is sustained as a nonpenal exercise of the
            power to regulate the franchise.<span class="sup">[22]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The same reasoning applies to Section 401 (g). The purpose of taking away citizenship
            from a convicted deserter is simply to punish him. There is no other legitimate purpose
            that the statute could serve. Denationalization in this case is not even claimed to be a
            means of solving international problems, as was argued in Perez. Here the purpose is
            punishment, and therefore the statute is a penal law.</p>
         <p>It is urged that this statute is not a penal law but a regulatory provision authorized
            by the war power. It cannot be denied that Congress has power to prescribe rules
            governing the proper performance of military obligations, of which perhaps the most
            significant is the performance of one's duty when hazardous or important service is
            required. But a statute that prescribes the consequence that will befall one who fails
            to abide by these regulatory provisions is a penal law. Plainly legislation prescribing
            imprisonment for the crime of desertion is penal in nature. If loss of citizenship is
            substituted for imprisonment, it cannot fairly be said that the use of this particular
            sanction transforms the fundamental nature of the statute. In fact, a dishonorable
            discharge with consequent loss of citizenship might be the only punishment meted out by
            a court-martial. During World War II the threat of this punishment was explicitly
            communicated by the Army to soldiers in the field.<span class="sup">[23]</span> If this
            statute taking away citizenship is a congressional exercise of the war power, then it
            cannot rationally be treated other than as a penal law, because it imposes the sanction
            of denationalization <span class="star-pagination">*98</span> for the purpose of
            punishing transgression of a standard of conduct prescribed in the exercise of that
            power.</p>
         <p>The Government argues that the sanction of denationalization imposed by Section 401 (g)
            is not a penalty because deportation has not been so considered by this Court. While
            deportation is undoubtedly a harsh sanction that has a severe penal effect, this Court
            has in the past sustained deportation as an exercise of the sovereign's power to
            determine the conditions upon which an alien may reside in this country.<span
               class="sup">[24]</span> For example, the statute<span class="sup">[25]</span>
            authorizing deportation of an alien convicted under the 1917 Espionage Act<span
               class="sup">[26]</span> was viewed, not as designed to punish him for the crime of
            espionage, but as an implementation of the sovereign power to exclude, from which the
            deporting power is derived. Mahler v. Eby, 264 U. S. 32. This view of deportation may be
            highly fictional, but even if its validity is conceded, it is wholly inapplicable to
            this case. No one contends that the Government has, in addition to the power to exclude
            all aliens, a sweeping power to denationalize all citizens. Nor does comparison to
            denaturalization eliminate the penal effect of denationalization in this case.
            Denaturalization is not imposed to penalize the alien for having falsified his
            application for citizenship; if it were, it would be a punishment. Rather, it is imposed
            in the exercise of the power to make rules for the naturalization of aliens.<span
               class="sup">[27]</span> In short, the fact that deportation and denaturalization for
            fraudulent procurement of citizenship may be imposed for purposes other than punishment
            affords no <span class="star-pagination">*99</span> basis for saying that in this case
            denationalization is not a punishment.</p>
         <p>Section 401 (g) is a penal law, and we must face the question whether the Constitution
            permits the Congress to take away citizenship as a punishment for crime. If it is
            assumed that the power of Congress extends to divestment of citizenship, the problem
            still remains as to this statute whether denationalization is a cruel and unusual
            punishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment.<span class="sup">[28]</span>
            Since wartime desertion is punishable by death, there can be no argument that the
            penalty of denationalization is excessive in relation to the gravity of the crime. The
            question is whether this penalty subjects the individual to a fate forbidden by the
            principle of civilized treatment guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment.</p>
         <p>At the outset, let us put to one side the death penalty as an index of the
            constitutional limit on punishment. Whatever the arguments may be against capital
            punishment, both on moral grounds and in terms of accomplishing the purposes of
            punishment&#x97;and they are forceful&#x97; the death penalty has been employed
            throughout our history, and, in a day when it is still widely accepted, it cannot be
            said to violate the constitutional concept of cruelty. But it is equally plain that the
            existence of the death penalty is not a license to the Government to devise any
            punishment short of death within the limit of its imagination.</p>
         <p>The exact scope of the constitutional phrase "cruel and unusual" has not been detailed
            by this Court.<span class="sup">[29]</span> But the <span class="star-pagination"
               >*100</span> basic policy reflected in these words is firmly established in the
            Anglo-American tradition of criminal justice. The phrase in our Constitution was taken
            directly from the English Declaration of Rights of 1688,<span class="sup">[30]</span>
            and the principle it represents can be traced back to the Magna Carta.<span class="sup"
               >[31]</span> The basic concept underlying the Eighth Amendment is nothing less than
            the dignity of man. While the State has the power to punish, the Amendment stands to
            assure that this power be exercised within the limits of civilized standards. Fines,
            imprisonment and even execution may be imposed depending upon the enormity of the crime,
            but any technique outside the bounds of these traditional penalties is constitutionally
            suspect. This Court has had little occasion to give precise content to the Eighth
            Amendment, and, in an enlightened democracy such as ours, this is not surprising. But
            when the Court was confronted with a punishment of 12 years in irons at hard and painful
            labor imposed for the crime of falsifying public records, it did not hesitate to declare
            that the penalty was cruel in its excessiveness and unusual in its character. Weems v.
            United States, 217 U. S. 349. The Court recognized in that case that the words of the
            Amendment are not precise,<span class="sup">[32]</span> and that their <span
               class="star-pagination">*101</span> scope is not static. The Amendment must draw its
            meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing
            society.</p>
         <p>We believe, as did Chief Judge Clark in the court below,<span class="sup">[33]</span>
            that use of denationalization as a punishment is barred by the Eighth Amendment. There
            may be involved no physical mistreatment, no primitive torture. There is instead the
            total destruction of the individual's status in organized society. It is a form of
            punishment more primitive than torture, for it destroys for the individual the political
            existence that was centuries in the development. The punishment strips the citizen of
            his status in the national and international political community. His very existence is
            at the sufferance of the country in which he happens to find himself. While any one
            country may accord him some rights, and presumably as long as he remained in this
            country he would enjoy the limited rights of an alien, no country need do so because he
            is stateless. Furthermore, his enjoyment of even the limited rights of an alien might be
            subject to termination <span class="star-pagination">*102</span> at any time by reason
            of deportation.<span class="sup">[34]</span> In short, the expatriate has lost the right
            to have rights.</p>
         <p>This punishment is offensive to cardinal principles for which the Constitution stands.
            It subjects the individual to a fate of ever-increasing fear and distress. He knows not
            what discriminations may be established against him, what proscriptions may be directed
            against him, and when and for what cause his existence in his native land may be
            terminated. He may be subject to banishment, a fate universally decried by civilized
            people. He is stateless, a condition deplored in the international community of
               democracies.<span class="sup">[35]</span> It is no answer to suggest that all the
            disastrous consequences of this fate may not be brought to bear on a stateless person.
            The threat makes the punishment obnoxious.<span class="sup">[36]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The civilized nations of the world are in virtual unanimity that statelessness is not to
            be imposed as punishment for crime. It is true that several countries prescribe
            expatriation in the event that their nationals engage in conduct in derogation of native
               allegiance.<span class="sup">[37]</span> Even statutes of this sort are generally
            applicable primarily <span class="star-pagination">*103</span> to naturalized citizens.
            But use of denationalization as punishment for crime is an entirely different matter.
            The United Nations' survey of the nationality laws of 84 nations of the world reveals
            that only two countries, the Philippines and Turkey, impose denationalization as a
            penalty for desertion.<span class="sup">[38]</span> In this country the Eighth Amendment
            forbids this to be done.</p>
         <p>In concluding as we do that the Eighth Amendment forbids Congress to punish by taking
            away citizenship, we are mindful of the gravity of the issue inevitably raised whenever
            the constitutionality of an Act of the National Legislature is challenged. No member of
            the Court believes that in this case the statute before us can be construed to avoid the
            issue of constitutionality. That issue confronts us, and the task of resolving it is
            inescapably ours. This task requires the exercise of judgment, not the reliance upon
            personal preferences. Courts must not consider the wisdom of statutes but neither can
            they sanction as being merely unwise that which the Constitution forbids.</p>
         <p>We are oath-bound to defend the Constitution. This obligation requires that
            congressional enactments be judged by the standards of the Constitution. The Judiciary
            has the duty of implementing the constitutional safeguards that protect individual
            rights. When the Government acts to take away the fundamental right of citizenship, the
            safeguards of the Constitution should be examined with special diligence.</p>
         <p>The provisions of the Constitution are not time-worn adages or hollow shibboleths. They
            are vital, living principles that authorize and limit governmental powers in our Nation.
            They are the rules of government. When the constitutionality of an Act of Congress is
            challenged in this Court, we must apply those rules. If we <span class="star-pagination"
               >*104</span> do not, the words of the Constitution become little more than good
            advice.</p>
         <p>When it appears that an Act of Congress conflicts with one of these provisions, we have
            no choice but to enforce the paramount commands of the Constitution. We are sworn to do
            no less. We cannot push back the limits of the Constitution merely to accommodate
            challenged legislation. We must apply those limits as the Constitution prescribes them,
            bearing in mind both the broad scope of legislative discretion and the ultimate
            responsibility of constitutional adjudication. We do well to approach this task
            cautiously, as all our predecessors have counseled. But the ordeal of judgment cannot be
            shirked. In some 81 instances since this Court was established it has determined that
            congressional action exceeded the bounds of the Constitution. It is so in this case.</p>
         <p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is reversed and the cause is
            remanded to the District Court for appropriate proceedings.</p>
         <p>Reversed and remanded.</p></div>

         <p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK, whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, concurring.</p>
         <p>While I concur in the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE there is one additional thing that
            needs to be said.</p>
         <p>Even if citizenship could be involuntarily divested, I do not believe that the power to
            denationalize may be placed in the hands of military authorities. If desertion or other
            misconduct is to be a basis for forfeiting citizenship, guilt should be determined in a
            civilian court of justice where all the protections of the Bill of Rights guard the
            fairness of the outcome. Such forfeiture should not rest on the findings of a military
            tribunal. Military courts may try soldiers and punish them for military offenses, but
            they should not have the last word on the soldier's right to citizenship. The statute
            held invalid <span class="star-pagination">*105</span> here not only makes the
            military's finding of desertion final but gives military authorities discretion to
            choose which soldiers convicted of desertion shall be allowed to keep their citizenship
            and which ones shall thereafter be stateless. Nothing in the Constitution or its history
            lends the slightest support for such military control over the right to be an American
            citizen.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="concurrence" judge="brennan">
         <p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, concurring.</p>
         <p>In Perez v. Brownell, ante, p. 44, also decided today, I agreed with the Court that
            there was no constitutional infirmity in § 401 (e), which expatriates the citizen who
            votes in a foreign political election. I reach a different conclusion in this case,
            however, because I believe that § 401 (g), which expatriates the wartime deserter who is
            dishonorably discharged after conviction by court-martial, lies beyond Congress' power
            to enact. It is, concededly, paradoxical to justify as constitutional the expatriation
            of the citizen who has committed no crime by voting in a Mexican political election, yet
            find unconstitutional a statute which provides for the expatriation of a soldier guilty
            of the very serious crime of desertion in time of war. The loss of citizenship may have
            as ominous significance for the individual in the one case as in the other. Why then
            does not the Constitution prevent the expatriation of the voter as well as the
            deserter?</p>
         <p>Here, as in Perez v. Brownell, we must inquire whether there exists a relevant
            connection between the particular legislative enactment and the power granted to
            Congress by the Constitution. The Court there held that such a relevant connection
            exists between the power to maintain relations with other sovereign nations and the
            power to expatriate the American who votes in a foreign election. (1) Within the power
            granted to Congress to regulate the conduct of foreign affairs lies the power to deal
            with evils which might obstruct or embarrass our diplomatic <span
               class="star-pagination">*106</span> interests. Among these evils, Congress might
            believe, is that of voting by American citizens in political elections of other
               nations.<span class="sup">[1]</span> Whatever the realities of the situation, many
            foreign nations may well view political activity on the part of Americans, even if
            lawful, as either expressions of official American positions or else as improper
            meddling in affairs not their own. In either event the reaction is liable to be
            detrimental to the interests of the United States. (2) Finding that this was an evil
            which Congress was empowered to prevent, the Court concluded that expatriation was a
            means reasonably calculated to achieve this end. Expatriation, it should be noted, has
            the advantage of acting automatically, for the very act of casting the ballot is the act
            of denationalization, which could have the effect of cutting off American responsibility
            for the consequences. If a foreign government objects, our answer should be
            conclusive&#x97;the voter is no longer one of ours. Harsh as the consequences may be to
            the individual concerned, Congress has ordained the loss of citizenship simultaneously
            with the act of voting because Congress might reasonably believe that in these
            circumstances there is no acceptable alternative to expatriation as a means of avoiding
            possible embarrassments to our relations with foreign nations.<span class="sup"
               >[2]</span> And where Congress has determined that considerations of the highest
            national importance indicate a course of action for which an adequate <span
               class="star-pagination">*107</span> substitute might rationally appear lacking, I
            cannot say that this means lies beyond Congress' power to choose. Cf. Korematsu v.
            United States, 323 U. S. 214.</p>
         <p>In contrast to § 401 (e), the section with which we are now concerned, § 401 (g), draws
            upon the power of Congress to raise and maintain military forces to wage war. No
            pretense can here be made that expatriation of the deserter in any way relates to the
            conduct of foreign affairs, for this statute is not limited in its effects to those who
            desert in a foreign country or who flee to another land. Nor is this statute limited in
            its application to the deserter whose conduct imports "elements of an allegiance to
            another country in some measure, at least, inconsistent with American citizenship."
            Perez v. Brownell, supra, at 61. The history of this provision, indeed, shows that the
            essential congressional purpose was a response to the needs of the military in
            maintaining discipline in the armed forces, especially during wartime. There can be no
            serious question that included in Congress' power to maintain armies is the power to
            deal with the problem of desertion, an act plainly destructive, not only of the military
            establishment as such, but, more importantly, of the Nation's ability to wage war
            effectively. But granting that Congress is authorized to deal with the evil of
            desertion, we must yet inquire whether expatriation is a means reasonably calculated to
            achieve this legitimate end and thereby designed to further the ultimate congressional
            objective&#x97;the successful waging of war.</p>
         <p>Expatriation of the deserter originated in the Act of 1865, 13 Stat. 490, when wholesale
            desertion and draftlaw violations seriously threatened the effectiveness of the Union
               armies.<span class="sup">[3]</span> The 1865 Act expressly provided <span
               class="star-pagination">*108</span> that expatriation was to be "in addition to the
            other lawful penalties of the crime of desertion . . . ." This was emphasized in the
            leading case under the 1865 Act, Huber v. Reily, <span class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">53</span>
               <span class="reporter">Pa.</span>
               <span class="page">112</span>
            </span>, decided by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court little more than a year after passage
            of the Act. The court said that "Its avowed purpose is to add to the penalties which the
            law had previously affixed to the offence of desertion from the military or naval
            service of the United States, and it denominates the additional sanctions provided as
            penalties." Id., at 114-115.</p>
         <p>But, although it imposed expatriation entirely as an added punishment for crime, the
            1865 Act did not expressly make conviction by court-martial a prerequisite to that
            punishment, as was the case with the conventional penalties. The Pennsylvania Supreme
            Court felt that Huber was right in contending that this was a serious constitutional
            objection: "[T]he act proposes to inflict pains and penalties upon offenders before and
            without a trial and conviction by due process of law, and . . . it is therefore
            prohibited by the Bill of Rights." 53 Pa., at 115. The court, however, construed the
            statute so as to avoid these constitutional difficulties, holding that loss of
            citizenship, like other penalties for desertion, followed only upon conviction by
            court-martial.</p>
         <p>This view of the 1865 Act was approved by this Court in Kurtz v. Moffitt, 115 U. S. 487,
            501, and, as noted there, the same view "has been uniformly held by the civil courts as
            well as by the military authorities." See McCafferty v. Guyer, 59 Pa. 109; State v.
            Symonds, <span class="citation no-link">

            Precedents (2d ed. 1896), 1001.<span class="sup">[4]</span> Of <span
               class="star-pagination">*109</span> particular significance, moreover, is the fact
            that the Congress has confirmed the correctness of the view that it purposed
            expatriation of the deserter solely as additional punishment. The present § 401 (g)
            merely incorporates the 1865 provision in the codification which became the 1940
            Nationality Act.<span class="sup">[5]</span> But now there is expressly stated what was
            omitted from the 1865 Act, namely, that the deserter shall be expatriated "if and when
            he is convicted thereof by court martial . . . ." 54 Stat. 1169, as amended, 8 U. S. C.
            § 1481 (a) (8).<span class="sup">[6]</span>
         </p>
         <p>It is difficult, indeed, to see how expatriation of the deserter helps wage war except
            as it performs that function when imposed as punishment. It is obvious that expatriation
            cannot in any wise avoid the harm apprehended by Congress. After the act of desertion,
            only <span class="star-pagination">*110</span> punishment can follow, for the harm has
            been done. The deserter, moreover, does not cease to be an American citizen at the
            moment he deserts. Indeed, even conviction does not necessarily effect his expatriation,
            for dishonorable discharge is the condition precedent to loss of citizenship. Therefore,
            if expatriation is made a consequence of desertion, it must stand together with death
            and imprisonment&#x97;as a form of punishment.</p>
         <p>To characterize expatriation as punishment is, of course, but the beginning of critical
            inquiry. As punishment it may be extremely harsh, but the crime of desertion may be
            grave indeed. However, the harshness of the punishment may be an important consideration
            where the asserted power to expatriate has only a slight or tenuous relation to the
            granted power. In its material forms no one can today judge the precise consequences of
            expatriation, for happily American law has had little experience with this status, and
            it cannot be said hypothetically to what extent the severity of the status may be
            increased consistently with the demands of due process. But it can be supposed that the
            consequences of greatest weight, in terms of ultimate impact on the petitioner, are
            unknown and unknowable.<span class="sup">[7]</span> Indeed, in truth, he may live out
            his life with but minor inconvenience. He may perhaps live, work, marry, raise a family,
            and generally experience a satisfactorily happy life. Nevertheless it cannot be denied
            that the impact of expatriation&#x97; especially where statelessness is the
            upshot&#x97;may be severe. Expatriation, in this respect, constitutes an <span
               class="star-pagination">*111</span> especially demoralizing sanction. The
            uncertainty, and the consequent psychological hurt, which must accompany one who becomes
            an outcast in his own land must be reckoned a substantial factor in the ultimate
            judgment.</p>
         <p>In view of the manifest severity of this sanction, I feel that we should look closely at
            its probable effect to determine whether Congress' imposition of expatriation as a penal
            device is justified in reason. Clearly the severity of the penalty, in the case of a
            serious offense, is not enough to invalidate it where the nature of the penalty is
            rationally directed to achieve the legitimate ends of punishment.</p>
         <p>The novelty of expatriation as punishment does not alone demonstrate its inefficiency.
            In recent years we have seen such devices as indeterminate sentences and parole added to
            the traditional term of imprisonment. Such penal methods seek to achieve the end, at
            once more humane and effective, that society should make every effort to rehabilitate
            the offender and restore him as a useful member of that society as society's own best
            protection. Of course, rehabilitation is but one of the several purposes of the penal
            law. Among other purposes are deterrents of the wrongful act by the threat of punishment
            and insulation of society from dangerous individuals by imprisonment or execution. What
            then is the relationship of the punishment of expatriation to these ends of the penal
            law? It is perfectly obvious that it constitutes the very antithesis of rehabilitation,
            for instead of guiding the offender back into the useful paths of society it
            excommunicates him and makes him, literally, an outcast. I can think of no more certain
            way in which to make a man in whom, perhaps, rest the seeds of serious antisocial
            behavior more likely to pursue further a career of unlawful activity than to place on
            him the stigma of the derelict, uncertain of many of his basic rights. Similarly, it
            must be questioned whether expatriation <span class="star-pagination">*112</span> can
            really achieve the other effects sought by society in punitive devices. Certainly it
            will not insulate society from the deserter, for unless coupled with banishment the
            sanction leaves the offender at large. And as a deterrent device this sanction would
            appear of little effect, for the offender, if not deterred by thought of the specific
            penalties of long imprisonment or even death, is not very likely to be swayed from his
            course by the prospect of expatriation.<span class="sup">[8]</span> However insidious
            and demoralizing may be the actual experience of statelessness, its contemplation in
            advance seems unlikely to invoke serious misgiving, for none of us yet knows its
            ramifications.</p>
         <p>In the light of these considerations, it is understandable that the Government has not
            pressed its case on the basis of expatriation of the deserter as punishment for his
            crime. Rather, the Government argues that the necessary nexus to the granted power is to
            be found in the idea that legislative withdrawal of citizenship is justified in this
            case because Trop's desertion constituted a refusal to perform one of the highest duties
            of American citizenship&#x97;the bearing of arms in a time of desperate national peril.
            It cannot be denied that there is implicit in this a certain rough justice. He who
            refuses to act as an American should no longer be an American&#x97;what could be fairer?
            But I cannot see that this is anything other than forcing retribution from the
            offender&#x97;naked vengeance. But many acts of desertion certainly fall far short of a
            "refusal to perform this ultimate duty of American citizenship."</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*113</span> Desertion is defined as "absence without leave
            accompanied by the intention not to return." Army Manual for Courts-Martial (1928) 142.
            The offense may be quite technical, as where an officer, "having tendered his
            resignation and prior to due notice of the acceptance of the same, quits his post or
            proper duties without leave and with intent to absent himself permanently therefrom. . .
            ." Article of War 28 (1920), 41 Stat. 792. Desertion is also committed where a soldier,
            without having received a regular discharge, re-enlists in the same or another service.
            The youngster, for example, restive at his assignment to a supply depot, who runs off to
            the front to be in the fight, subjects himself to the possibility of this sanction. Yet
            the statute imposes the penalty coextensive with the substantive crime. Since many acts
            of desertion thus certainly fall far short of a "refusal to perform this ultimate duty
            of American citizenship," it stretches the imagination excessively to establish a
            rational relation of mere retribution to the ends purported to be served by expatriation
            of the deserter. I simply cannot accept a judgment that Congress is free to adopt any
            measure at all to demonstrate its displeasure and exact its penalty from the offender
            against its laws.</p>
         <p>It seems to me that nothing is solved by the uncritical reference to service in the
            armed forces as the "ultimate duty of American citizenship." Indeed, it is very
            difficult to imagine, on this theory of power, why Congress cannot impose expatriation
            as punishment for any crime at all&#x97;for tax evasion, for bank robbery, for narcotics
            offenses. As citizens we are also called upon to pay our taxes and to obey the laws, and
            these duties appear to me to be fully as related to the nature of our citizenship as our
            military obligations. But Congress' asserted power to expatriate the deserter bears to
            the war powers precisely the same relation as its power to expatriate the tax evader
            would bear to the taxing power.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*114</span> I therefore must conclude that § 401 (g) is
            beyond the power of Congress to enact. Admittedly Congress' belief that expatriation of
            the deserter might further the war effort may find some&#x97;though necessarily
            slender&#x97;support in reason. But here, any substantial achievement, by this device,
            of Congress' legitimate purposes under the war power seems fairly remote. It is at the
            same time abundantly clear that these ends could more fully be achieved by alternative
            methods not open to these objections. In the light of these factors, and conceding all
            that I possibly can in favor of the enactment, I can only conclude that the requisite
            rational relation between this statute and the war power does not appear&#x97;for in
            this relation the statute is not "really calculated to effect any of the objects
            entrusted to the government . . . ," M'Culloch v. Maryland, <span

            HARLAN join, dissenting.</p>
         <p>Petitioner was born in Ohio in 1924. While in the Army serving in French Morocco in
            1944, he was tried by a general court-martial and found guilty of having twice escaped
            from confinement, of having been absent without leave, and of having deserted and
            remained in desertion for one day. He was sentenced to a dishonorable discharge,
            forfeiture of all pay and allowances and confinement at hard labor for three years. He
            subsequently returned to the United States. In 1952 he applied for a passport; this
            application was denied by the State Department on the ground that petitioner had lost
            his citizenship as a result of his conviction of and dishonorable discharge for
            desertion from the Army in time of war. The Department relied upon § 401 of the <span
               class="star-pagination">*115</span> Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1137, 1168, as
            amended by the Act of January 20, 1944, 58 Stat. 4, which provided, in pertinent
               part,<span class="sup">[1]</span> that</p> "A person who is a national of the United
         States, whether by birth or naturalization, shall lose his nationality by: ..... "(g)
         Deserting the military or naval forces of the United States in time of war, provided he is
         convicted thereof by court martial and as the result of such conviction is dismissed or
         dishonorably discharged from the service of such military or naval forces: Provided, That
         notwithstanding loss of nationality or citizenship or civil or political rights under the
         terms of this or previous Acts by reason of desertion committed in time of war, restoration
         to active duty with such military or naval forces in time of war or the reenlistment or
         induction of such a person in time of war with permission of competent military or naval
         authority, prior or subsequent to the effective date of this Act, shall be deemed to have
         the immediate effect of restoring such nationality or citizenship and all civil and
         political rights heretofore or hereafter so lost and of removing all civil and political
         disabilities resulting therefrom . . . ." <p>In 1955 petitioner brought suit in a United
            States District Court for a judgment declaring him to be a national of the United
            States. The Government's motion for summary judgment was granted and petitioner's
            denied. <span class="star-pagination">*116</span> The Court of Appeals for the Second
            Circuit affirmed, one judge dissenting. 239 F. 2d 527.</p>
         <p>At the threshold the petitioner suggests constructions of the statute that would avoid
            consideration of constitutional issues. If such a construction is precluded, petitioner
            contends that Congress is without power to attach loss of citizenship as a consequence
            of conviction for desertion. He also argues that such an exercise of power would violate
            the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and the prohibition
            against cruel and unusual punishments in the Eighth Amendment.</p>
         <p>The subsection of § 401 of the Nationality Act of 1940, as amended, making loss of
            nationality result from a conviction for desertion in wartime is a direct descendant of
            a provision enacted during the Civil War. One section of "An Act to amend the several
            Acts heretofore passed to provide for the Enrolling and Calling out [of] the National
            Forces, and for other Purposes," 13 Stat. 487, 490, approved on March 3, 1865, provided
            that "in addition to the other lawful penalties of the crime of desertion from the
            military or naval service," all persons who desert such service "shall be deemed and
            taken to have voluntarily relinquished and forfeited their rights of citizenship and
            their rights to become citizens . . . ." Except as limited in 1912 to desertion in time
            of war, 37 Stat. 356, the provision remained in effect until absorbed into the
            Nationality Act of 1940. 54 Stat. 1137, 1169, 1172. Shortly after its enactment the 1865
            provision received an important interpretation in Huber v. Reily, <span
               class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">53</span>
               <span class="reporter">Pa.</span>
               <span class="page">112</span>
            </span> (1866). There, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in an opinion by Mr. Justice
            Strong, later of this Court, held that the disabilities of the 1865 Act could attach
            only after the individual had been convicted of desertion by a court-martial. The
            requirement was drawn from the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the
            Constitution. 53 Pa., at 116-118. This interpretation was <span class="star-pagination"
               >*117</span> followed by other courts, e. g., State v. Symonds, <span

               <span class="page">148</span>
            </span>, and was referred to approvingly by this Court in 1885 in Kurtz v. Moffitt, 115
            U. S. 487, without discussion of its rationale.</p>
         <p>When the nationality laws of the United States were revised and codified as the
            Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1137, there was added to the list of acts that result
            in loss of American nationality, "Deserting the military or naval service of the United
            States in time of war, provided he [the deserter] is convicted thereof by a court
            martial." § 401 (g), 54 Stat. 1169. During the consideration of the Act, there was
            substantially no debate on this provision. It seems clear, however, from the report of
            the Cabinet Committee that had recommended its adoption that nothing more was intended
            in its enactment than to incorporate the 1865 provision into the 1940 codification, at
            the same time making it clear that nationality, and not the ambiguous "rights of
               citizenship,"<span class="sup">[2]</span> was to be lost and that the provision
            applied to all nationals. Codification of the Nationality Laws of the United States, H.
            R. Comm. Print, Pt. 1, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. 68.</p>
         <p>In 1944, at the request of the War Department, Congress amended § 401 (g) of the 1940
            Act into the form in which it was when applied to the petitioner; this amendment
            required that a dismissal or dishonorable discharge result from the conviction for
            desertion before expatriation should follow and provided that restoration of a deserter
            to active duty during wartime should have the effect of restoring his citizenship. 58
            Stat. 4. It is abundantly clear from the debate and reports that the <span
               class="star-pagination">*118</span> sole purpose of this change was to permit persons
            convicted of desertion to regain their citizenship and continue serving in the armed
            forces, H. R. Rep. No. 302, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. 1; S. Rep. No. 382, 78th Cong., 1st
            Sess. 1; 89 Cong. Rec. 10135. Because it was thought unreasonable to require persons who
            were still in the service to fight and, perhaps, die for the country when they were no
            longer citizens, the requirement of dismissal or dishonorable discharge prior to
            denationalization was included in the amendment. See S. Rep. No. 382, supra, at 3; 89
            Cong. Rec. 3241.</p>
         <p>Petitioner advances two possible constructions of § 401 (g) that would exclude him from
            its operation and avoid constitutional determinations. It is suggested that the
            provision applies only to desertion to the enemy and that the sentence of a dishonorable
            discharge, without the imposition of which a conviction for desertion does not have an
            expatriating effect, must have resulted from a conviction solely for desertion. There is
            no support for the first of these constructions in a fair reading of § 401 (g) or in its
            congressional history. Rigorously as we are admonished to avoid consideration of
            constitutional issues if statutory disposition is available, it would do violence to
            what this statute compellingly conveys to draw from it a meaning other than what it
            spontaneously reveals.</p>
         <p>Section 401 (g) imposes expatriation on an individual for desertion "provided he is
            convicted thereof by court martial and as the result of such conviction is dismissed or
            dishonorably discharged from the service of such military or naval forces . . . ."
            Petitioner's argument is that the dishonorable discharge must be solely "the result of
            such conviction" and that § 401 (g) is therefore not applicable to him, convicted as he
            was of escape from confinement and absence without leave in addition to desertion. Since
            the invariable practice in military trials <span class="star-pagination">*119</span> is
            and has been that related offenses are tried together with but a single sentence to
            cover all convictions, see Jackson v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 569, 574, the effect of the
            suggested construction would be to force a break with the historic process of military
            law for which Congress has not in the remotest way given warrant. The obvious purpose of
            the 1944 amendment, requiring dishonorable discharge as a condition precedent to
            expatriation, was to correct the situation in which an individual who had been convicted
            of desertion, and who had thus lost his citizenship, was kept on duty to fight and
            sometimes die "for his country which disowns him." Letter from Secretary of War to
            Chairman, Senate Military Affairs Committee, S. Rep. No. 382, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. 3.
            There is not a hint in the congressional history that the requirement of discharge was
            intended to make expatriation depend on the seriousness of the desertion, as measured by
            the sentence imposed. If we are to give effect to the purpose of Congress in making a
            conviction for wartime desertion result in loss of citizenship, we must hold that the
            dishonorable discharge, in order for expatriation to follow, need only be "the result
            of" conviction for one or more offenses among which one must be wartime desertion.</p>
         <p>Since none of petitioner's nonconstitutional grounds for reversal can be sustained, his
            claim of unconstitutionality must be faced. What is always basic when the power of
            Congress to enact legislation is challenged is the appropriate approach to judicial
            review of congressional legislation. All power is, in Madison's phrase, "of an
            encroaching nature." <ref type="treatise" num="48">Federalist</ref>, No. 48 (Earle ed.
            1937), at 321. Judicial power is not immune against this human weakness. It also must be
            on guard against encroaching beyond its proper bounds, and not the less so since the
            only restraint upon it is self-restraint. When the power of Congress to pass a statute
            is challenged, the function <span class="star-pagination">*120</span> of this Court is
            to determine whether legislative action lies clearly outside the constitutional grant of
            power to which it has been, or may fairly be, referred. In making this determination,
            the Court sits in judgment on the action of a co-ordinate branch of the Government while
            keeping unto itself&#x97;as it must under our constitutional system&#x97;the final
            determination of its own power to act. No wonder such a function is deemed "the gravest
            and most delicate duty that this Court is called on to perform." Holmes, J., in Blodgett
            v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 148 (separate opinion). This is not a lip-serving
            platitude.</p>
         <p>Rigorous observance of the difference between limits of power and wise exercise of
            power&#x97;between questions of authority and questions of prudence&#x97;requires the
            most alert appreciation of this decisive but subtle relationship of two concepts that
            too easily coalesce. No less does it require a disciplined will to adhere to the
            difference. It is not easy to stand aloof and allow want of wisdom to prevail, to
            disregard one's own strongly held view of what is wise in the conduct of affairs. But it
            is not the business of this Court to pronounce policy. It must observe a fastidious
            regard for limitations on its own power, and this precludes the Court's giving effect to
            its own notions of what is wise or politic. That self-restraint is of the essence in the
            observance of the judicial oath, for the Constitution has not authorized the judges to
            sit in judgment on the wisdom of what Congress and the Executive Branch do.</p>
         <p>One of the principal purposes in establishing the Constitution was to "provide for the
            common defence." To that end the States granted to Congress the several powers of
            Article I, Section 8, clauses 11 to 14 and 18, compendiously described as the "war
            power." Although these specific grants of power do not specifically enumerate every
            factor relevant to the power to conduct war, there is no limitation upon it (other than
            what the Due Process <span class="star-pagination">*121</span> Clause commands). The
            scope of the war power has been defined by Chief Justice Hughes in Home Bldg. &amp;amp;
            Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398, 426: "[T]he war power of the Federal Government
            is not created by the emergency of war, but it is a power given to meet that emergency.
            It is a power to wage war successfully, and thus it permits the harnessing of the entire
            energies of the people in a supreme cooperative effort to preserve the nation." See also
            Chief Justice Stone's opinion in Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81, 93.</p>
         <p>Probably the most important governmental action contemplated by the war power is the
            building up and maintenance of an armed force for the common defense. Just as Congress
            may be convinced of the necessity for conscription for the effective conduct of war,
            Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U. S. 366, Congress may justifiably be of the view that
            stern measures&#x97;what to some may seem overly stern&#x97;are needed in order that
            control may be had over evasions of military duty when the armed forces are committed to
            the Nation's defense, and that the deleterious effects of those evasions may be kept to
            the minimum. Clearly Congress may deal severely with the problem of desertion from the
            armed forces in wartime; it is equally clear&#x97;from the face of the legislation and
            from the circumstances in which it was passed&#x97;that Congress was calling upon its
            war powers when it made such desertion an act of expatriation. Cf. Winthrop, Military
            Law and Precedents (2d ed., Reprint 1920), 647.</p>
         <p>Possession by an American citizen of the rights and privileges that constitute
            citizenship imposes correlative obligations, of which the most indispensable may well be
            "to take his place in the ranks of the army of his country and risk the chance of being
            shot down in its defense," Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11, 29. Harsh as this
            may sound, it is no more so than the actualities to which it responds. Can it be said
            that there is no <span class="star-pagination">*122</span> rational nexus between
            refusal to perform this ultimate duty of American citizenship and legislative withdrawal
            of that citizenship? Congress may well have thought that making loss of citizenship a
            consequence of wartime desertion would affect the ability of the military authorities to
            control the forces with which they were expected to fight and win a major world
            conflict. It is not for us to deny that Congress might reasonably have believed the
            morale and fighting efficiency of our troops would be impaired if our soldiers knew that
            their fellows who had abandoned them in their time of greatest need were to remain in
            the communion of our citizens.</p>
         <p>Petitioner urges that imposing loss of citizenship as a "punishment" for wartime
            desertion is a violation of both the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the
            Eighth Amendment. His objections are that there is no notice of expatriation as a
            consequence of desertion in the provision defining that offense, that loss of
            citizenship as a "punishment" is unconstitutionally disproportionate to the offense of
            desertion and that loss of citizenship constitutes "cruel and unusual punishment."</p>
         <p>The provision of the Articles of War under which petitioner was convicted for desertion,
            Art. 58, Articles of War, 41 Stat. 787, 800, does not mention the fact that one
            convicted of that offense in wartime should suffer the loss of his citizenship. It may
            be that stating all of the consequences of conduct in the statutory provision making it
            an offense is a desideratum in the administration of criminal justice; that can scarcely
            be said&#x97;nor does petitioner contend that it ever has been said&#x97;to be a
            constitutional requirement. It is not for us to require Congress to list in one
            statutory section not only the ordinary penal consequences of engaging in activities
            therein prohibited but also the collateral disabilities that follow, by operation of
            law, from a conviction thereof duly resulting <span class="star-pagination">*123</span>
            from a proceeding conducted in accordance with all of the relevant constitutional
               safeguards.<span class="sup">[3]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Of course an individual should be apprised of the consequences of his actions. The
            Articles of War put petitioner on notice that desertion was an offense and that, when
            committed in wartime, it was punishable by death. Art. 58, supra. Expatriation
            automatically followed by command of the Nationality Act of 1940, a duly promulgated Act
            of Congress. The War Department appears to have made every effort to inform individual
            soldiers of the gravity of the consequences of desertion; its Circular No. 273 of 1942
            pointed out that convictions for desertion were punishable by death and would result in
            "forfeiture of the rights of citizenship," and it instructed unit commanders to "explain
            carefully to all <span class="star-pagination">*124</span> personnel of their commands
            [certain Articles of War, including Art. 58] . . . and emphasize the serious
            consequences which may result from their violation." Compilation of War Department
            General Orders, Bulletins, and Circulars (Government Printing Office 1943) 343. That
            Congress must define in the rubric of the substantive crime all the consequences of
            conduct it has made a grave offense and that it cannot provide for a collateral
            consequence, stern as it may be, by explicit pronouncement in another place on the
            statute books is a claim that hardly rises to the dignity of a constitutional
            requirement.</p>
         <p>Petitioner contends that loss of citizenship is an unconstitutionally disproportionate
            "punishment" for desertion and that it constitutes "cruel and unusual punishment" within
            the scope of the Eighth Amendment. Loss of citizenship entails undoubtedly
            severe&#x97;and in particular situations even tragic&#x97;consequences. Divestment of
            citizenship by the Government has been characterized, in the context of
            denaturalization, as "more serious than a taking of one's property, or the imposition of
            a fine or other penalty." Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U. S. 118, 122. However,
            like denaturalization, see Klapprott v. United States, 335 U. S. 601, 612, expatriation
            under the Nationality Act of 1940 is not "punishment" in any valid constitutional sense.
            Cf. Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U. S. 698, 730. Simply because denationalization
            was attached by Congress as a consequence of conduct that it had elsewhere made
            unlawful, it does not follow that denationalization is a "punishment," any more than it
            can be said that loss of civil rights as a result of conviction for a felony, see
            Gathings, Loss of Citizenship and Civil Rights for Conviction of Crime, 43 Am. Pol. Sci.
            Rev. 1228, 1233, is a "punishment" for any legally significant purposes. The process of
            denationalization, as devised by the expert Cabinet Committee on which Congress quite
            properly <span class="star-pagination">*125</span> and responsibly relied<span
               class="sup">[4]</span> and as established by Congress in the legislation before the
               Court,<span class="sup">[5]</span> was related to the authority of Congress, pursuant
            to its constitutional powers, to regulate conduct free from restrictions that pertain to
            legislation in the field technically described as criminal justice. Since there are
            legislative ends within the scope of Congress' war power that are wholly consistent with
            a "non-penal" purpose to regulate the military forces, and since there is nothing on the
            face of this legislation or in its history to indicate that Congress had a contrary
            purpose, there is no warrant for this Court's labeling the disability imposed by § 401
            (g) as a "punishment."</p>
         <p>Even assuming, arguendo, that § 401 (g) can be said to impose "punishment," to insist
            that denationalization is "cruel and unusual" punishment is to stretch that concept
            beyond the breaking point. It seems scarcely arguable that loss of citizenship is within
            the Eighth Amendment's prohibition because disproportionate to an offense that is
            capital and has been so from the first year of Independence. Art. 58, supra; § 6, Art.
            1, Articles of War of 1776, 5 J. Cont. Cong. (Ford ed. 1906) 792. Is constitutional
            dialectic so empty of reason that it can be seriously urged that loss of citizenship is
            a fate worse than death? The seriousness of abandoning one's country when it is in the
            grip of mortal conflict precludes denial <span class="star-pagination">*126</span> to
            Congress of the power to terminate citizenship here, unless that power is to be denied
            to Congress under any circumstance.</p>
         <p>Many civilized nations impose loss of citizenship for indulgence in designated
            prohibited activities. See, generally, Laws Concerning Nationality, U. N. Doc. No.
            ST/LEG/SER.B/4 (1954). Although these provisions are often, but not always, applicable
            only to naturalized citizens, they are more nearly comparable to our expatriation law
            than to our denaturalization law.<span class="sup">[6]</span> Some countries have made
            wartime desertion result in loss of citizenship&#x97;native-born or naturalized. E. g.,
            § 1 (6), Philippine Commonwealth Act No. 63 of Oct. 21, 1936, as amended by Republic Act
            No. 106 of June 2, 1947, U. N. Doc., supra, at 379; see Borchard, Diplomatic Protection
            of Citizens Abroad, 730. In this country, desertion has been punishable by loss of at
            least the "rights of citizenship"<span class="sup">[7]</span> since 1865. The Court
            today reaffirms its decisions (Mackenzie v. Hare, 239 U. S. 299; Savorgnan v. United
            States, 338 U. S. 491) sustaining the power of Congress to denationalize citizens who
            had no desire or intention to give up their citizenship. If loss of citizenship may
            constitutionally be made the consequence of such conduct as marrying a foreigner, and
            thus certainly not "cruel and unusual," it seems more than incongruous that such loss
            should be thought "cruel and unusual" when it is the consequence of conduct that is also
            a crime. In short, denationalization, when attached to the offense <span
               class="star-pagination">*127</span> of wartime desertion, cannot justifiably be
            deemed so at variance with enlightened concepts of "humane justice," see Weems v. United
            States, 217 U. S. 349, 378, as to be beyond the power of Congress, because constituting
            a "cruel and unusual" punishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment.</p>
         <p>Nor has Congress fallen afoul of that prohibition because a person's
            post-denationalization status has elements of unpredictability. Presumably a
            denationalized person becomes an alien vis-a-vis the United States. The very substantial
            rights and privileges that the alien in this country enjoys under the federal and state
            constitutions puts him in a very different condition from that of an outlaw in
            fifteenth-century England. He need not be in constant fear lest some dire and unforeseen
            fate be imposed on him by arbitrary governmental action&#x97; certainly not "while this
            Court sits" (Holmes, J., dissenting in Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox,
            277 U. S. 218, 223). The multitudinous decisions of this Court protective of the rights
            of aliens bear weighty testimony. And the assumption that brutal treatment is the
            inevitable lot of denationalized persons found in other countries is a slender basis on
            which to strike down an Act of Congress otherwise amply sustainable.</p>
         <p>It misguides popular understanding of the judicial function and of the limited power of
            this Court in our democracy to suggest that by not invalidating an Act of Congress we
            would endanger the necessary subordination of the military to civil authority. This
            case, no doubt, derives from the consequence of a court-martial. But we are sitting in
            judgment not on the military but on Congress. The military merely carried out a
            responsibility with which they were charged by Congress. Should the armed forces have
            ceased discharging wartime deserters because Congress attached the consequence it did to
            their performance of that responsibility?</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*128</span> This legislation is the result of an exercise
            by Congress of the legislative power vested in it by the Constitution and of an exercise
            by the President of his constitutional power in approving a bill and thereby making it
            "a law." To sustain it is to respect the actions of the two branches of our Government
            directly responsive to the will of the people and empowered under the Constitution to
            determine the wisdom of legislation. The awesome power of this Court to invalidate such
            legislation, because in practice it is bounded only by our own prudence in discerning
            the limits of the Court's constitutional function, must be exercised with the utmost
            restraint. Mr. Justice Holmes, one of the profoundest thinkers who ever sat on this
            Court, expressed the conviction that "I do not think the United States would come to an
            end if we lost our power to declare an Act of Congress void. I do think the Union would
            be imperiled if we could not make that declaration as to the laws of the several
            States." Holmes, Speeches, 102. He did not, of course, deny that the power existed to
            strike down congressional legislation, nor did he shrink from its exercise. But the
            whole of his work during his thirty years of service on this Court should be a constant
            reminder that the power to invalidate legislation must not be exercised as if, either in
            constitutional theory or in the art of government, it stood as the sole bulwark against
            unwisdom or excesses of the moment.</p>

         <p>[29] See Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U. S. 459; Weems v. United States,
            217 U. S. 349; Howard v. Fleming, 191 U. S. 126; O'Neil v. Vermont, 144 U. S. 323; In re
            Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436; Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130.</p>

         <p>[31] See 34 Minn. L. Rev. 134; 4 Vand. L. Rev. 680.</p>
         <p>[32] Whether the word "unusual" has any qualitative meaning different from "cruel" is
            not clear. On the few occasions this Court has had to consider the meaning of the
            phrase, precise distinctions between cruelty and unusualness do not seem to have been
            drawn. See Weems v. United States, supra; O'Neil v. Vermont, supra; Wilkerson v. Utah,
            supra. These cases indicate that the Court simply examines the particular punishment
            involved in light of the basic prohibition against inhuman treatment, without regard to
            any subtleties of meaning that might be latent in the word "unusual." But cf. In re
            Kemmler, supra, at 443; United States ex rel. Milwaukee Social Democratic Publishing Co.
            v. Burleson, 255 U. S. 407, 430 (Brandeis, J., dissenting). If the word "unusual" is to
            have any meaning apart from the word "cruel," however, the meaning should be the
            ordinary one, signifying something different from that which is generally done.
            Denationalization as a punishment certainly meets this test. It was never explicitly
            sanctioned by this Government until 1940 and never tested against the Constitution until
            this day.</p>
         <p>[33] "Plaintiff-appellant has cited to us and obviously relied on the masterful analysis
            of expatriation legislation set forth in the Comment, The Expatriation Act of 1954, 64
            Yale L. J. 1164, 1189-1199. I agree with the author's documented conclusions therein
            that punitive expatriation of persons with no other nationality constitutes cruel and
            unusual punishment and is invalid as such. Since I doubt if I can add to the persuasive
            arguments there made, I shall merely incorporate by reference. In my faith, the American
            concept of man's dignity does not comport with making even those we would punish
            completely `stateless'&#x97;fair game for the despoiler at home and the oppressor
            abroad, if indeed there is any place which will tolerate them at all." 239 F. 2d 527,
            530.</p>
         <p>[34] See discussion in Perez v. Brownell, ante, p. 44, at 64.</p>
         <p>[35] See Study on Statelessness, U. N. Doc. No. E/1112; Seckler-Hudson, Statelessness:
            With Special Reference to the United States; Borchard, Diplomatic Protection of Citizens
            Abroad, §§ 262, 334.</p>
         <p>[36] The suggestion that judicial relief will be available to alleviate the potential
            rigors of statelessness assumes too much. Undermining such assumption is the still fresh
            memory of Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U. S. 206, where an alien,
            resident in this country for 25 years, returned from a visit abroad to find himself
            barred from this country and from all others to which he turned. Summary imprisonment on
            Ellis Island was his fate, without any judicial examination of the grounds of his
            confinement. This Court denied relief, and the intolerable situation was remedied after
            four years' imprisonment only through executive action as a matter of grace. See N. Y.
            Times, Aug. 12, 1954, p. 10, col. 4.</p>
         <p>[37] See Laws Concerning Nationality, U. N. Doc. No. ST/LEG/ SER.B/4 (1954).</p>
         <p>[38] Id., at 379 and 461. Cf. Nationality Law of August 22, 1907, Art. 17 (2) (Haiti),
            id., at 208.</p>
         <p>[1] Some indication of the problem is to be seen in the joint resolutions introduced in
            both houses of Congress to exempt the two or three thousand Americans who allegedly lost
            their citizenship by voting in certain Italian elections. See S. J. Res. 47 and H. J.
            Res. 30, 239, 375, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. All proposed "to suspend the operation of
            section 401 (e) of the Nationality Act of 1940 in certain cases." See also H. R. 6400,
            81st Cong., 1st Sess.</p>
         <p>[2] Perez v. Brownell did not raise questions under the First Amendment, which of course
            would have the effect in appropriate cases of limiting congressional power otherwise
            possessed.</p>
         <p>[3] A good description of the extent of the problem raised by desertions from the Union
            armies, and of the extreme measures taken to combat the problem, will be found in
            Pullen, The Twentieth Maine: A volunteer Regiment of the Civil War (1957).</p>
         <p>[4] The opinion in Huber v. Reily, which was written by Mr. Justice Strong, later a
            member of this Court, suggested, if it did not hold, that the statutes and
            considerations of due process required that expatriation, to be accomplished, should be
            specifically included by the court-martial as part of the sentence. See 53 Pa., at
            119-120. The court-martial, under military law, adjudges both guilt and the extent of
            initial sentence. Jackson v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 569, 574-575; and see Article of War 58
            (1920), 41 Stat. 800. However, it has not been the practice specifically to include
            expatriation as part of the sentence. 2 Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents (2d ed.
            1896), 1001.</p>
         <p>[5] The provision was limited in 1912 to desertion in time of war, 37 Stat. 356, but
            otherwise was not revised until carried into the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1169.
            It was, however, first codified as part of the laws concerning citizenship as § 1998 of
            the 1874 Revised Statutes.</p>
         <p>[6] The reason for the addition of the proviso is stated in a report, Codification of
            the Nationality Laws of the United States, H. R. Comm. Print, Pt. 1, 76th Cong., 1st
            Sess., prepared at the request of the President by the Secretary of State, the Attorney
            General, and the Secretary of Labor, proposing a revision and codification of the
            nationality laws: "The provisions of sections 1996 and 1998 of the Revised Statutes are
            distinctly penal in character. They must, therefore, be construed strictly, and the
            penalties take effect only upon conviction by a court martial (Huber v. Reilly, 1866, 53
            Penn. St. 112; Kurtz v. Moffitt, 1885, 115 U. S. 487)." Id., at 68. </p>
         <p>The reference later in the report that § 401 "technically is not a penal law" is to the
            section as a whole and not to subdivision (g).</p>
         <p>[7] Adjudication of hypothetical and contingent consequences is beyond the function of
            this Court and the incidents of expatriation are altogether indefinite. Nonetheless,
            this very uncertainty of the consequences makes expatriation as punishment severe. </p>
         <p>It is also unnecessary to consider whether the consequences would be different for the
            citizen expatriated under another section than § 401 (g).</p>
         <p>[8] A deterrent effect is certainly conjectural when we are told that during World War
            II as many as 21,000 soldiers were convicted of desertion and sentenced to be
            dishonorably discharged. From the fact that the reviewing authorities ultimately
            remitted the dishonorable discharges in about two-thirds of these cases it is possible
            to infer that the military itself had no firm belief in the deterrent effects of
            expatriation.</p>
         <p>[1] The substance of this provision now appears in § 349 (a) (8) of the Immigration and
            Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 268, 8 U. S. C. § 1481 (a) (8).</p>
         <p>[2] The precise meaning of this phrase has never been clear, see Roche, The Loss of
            American Nationality&#x97;The Development of Statutory Expatriation, 99 U. of Pa. L.
            Rev. 25, 61-62. It appears, however, that the State Department regarded it to mean loss
            of citizenship, see, e. g., Hearings before the House Committee on Immigration and
            Naturalization on H. R. 6127, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. 38.</p>
         <p>[3] It should be noted that a person cannot be deprived of his citizenship merely on the
            basis of an administrative finding that he deserted in wartime or even with finality on
            the sole basis of his having been dishonorably discharged as a result of a conviction
            for wartime desertion. Section 503 of the Nationality Act of 1940 provides: </p>
         <p>"If any person who claims a right or privilege as a national of the United States is
            denied such right or privilege by any Department or agency, or executive official
            thereof, upon the ground that he is not a national of the United States, such person,
            regardless of whether he is within the United States or abroad, may institute an action
            against the head of such Department or agency in the District Court of the United States
            for the District of Columbia or in the district court of the United States for the
            district in which such person claims a permanent residence for a judgment declaring him
            to be a national of the United States. . . ." 54 Stat. 1137, 1171, now § 360 of the
            Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 273, 8 U. S. C. § 1503. In such a
            proceeding it is open to a person who, like petitioner, is alleged to have been
            expatriated under § 401 (g) of the 1940 Act to show, for example, that the court-martial
            was without jurisdiction (including observance of the requirements of due process) or
            that the individual, by his restoration to active duty after conviction and discharge,
            regained his citizenship under the terms of the proviso in § 401 (g), supra.</p>
         <p>[4] The report of that Committee stated that the provision in question "technically is
            not a penal law." Codification of the Nationality Laws of the United States, supra, at
            68. In their letter to the President covering the report, the Committee stated that none
            of the loss of nationality provisions was "designed to be punitive . . . ." Id., at
            VII.</p>
         <p>[5] There is no basis for finding that the Congress that enacted this provision regarded
            it otherwise than as part of the clearly nonpenal scheme of "acts of expatriation"
            represented by § 401 of the Nationality Act of 1940, supra.</p>
         <p>[6] In the United States, denaturalization is based exclusively on the theory that the
            individual obtained his citizenship by fraud, see Luria v. United States, 231 U. S. 9,
            24; the laws of many countries making naturalized citizens subject to expatriation for
            grounds not applicable to natural-born citizens do not relate those grounds to the
            actual naturalization process. E. g., British Nationality Act, 1948, 11 &amp;amp; 12
            Geo. VI, c. 56, § 20 (3).</p>
