         OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, ET AL. No. 138. <p>Supreme Court of United States.</p>
         Argued April 21, 1969. Decided June 16, 1969. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
         APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT. <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*488</span> Arthur Kinoy and Herbert O. Reid argued the
            cause for petitioners. With them on the brief were Robert L. Carter, Hubert T. Delany,
            William Kunstler, Frank D. Reeves, and Henry R. Williams.</p>
         <p>Bruce Bromley argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were John R.

         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*489</span> MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion
            of the Court.</p>
         <p>In November 1966, petitioner Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., was duly elected from the 18th
            Congressional District of New York to serve in the United States House of
            Representatives for the 90th Congress. However, pursuant to a House resolution, he was
            not permitted to take his seat. Powell (and some of the voters of his district) then
            filed suit in Federal District Court, claiming that the House could exclude him only if
            it found he failed to meet the standing requirements of age, citizenship, and residence
            contained in Art. I, &#x9e; 2, of the ConstitutionÔÇörequirements the House specifically
            found Powell metÔÇöand thus had excluded him unconstitutionally. The District Court
            dismissed petitioner's complaint "for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter." A
            panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal, although on somewhat different
            grounds, each judge filing a separate opinion. We have determined that it was error to
            dismiss the complaint and that petitioner Powell is entitled to a declaratory judgment
            that he was unlawfully excluded from the 90th Congress.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I.</h2>
         <p/>
         <h2>FACTS.</h2>
         <p>During the 89th Congress, a Special Subcommittee on Contracts of the Committee on House
            Administration conducted an investigation into the expenditures of the Committee on
            Education and Labor, of which petitioner <span class="star-pagination">*490</span> Adam
            Clayton Powell, Jr., was chairman. The Special Subcommittee issued a report concluding
            that Powell and certain staff employees had deceived the House authorities as to travel
            expenses. The report also indicated there was strong evidence that certain illegal
            salary payments had been made to Powell's wife at his direction. See H. R. Rep. No.
            2349, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 6-7 (1966). No formal action was taken during the 89th
            Congress. However, prior to the organization of the 90th Congress, the Democratic
            members-elect met in caucus and voted to remove Powell as chairman of the Committee on
            Education and Labor. See H. R. Rep. No. 27, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 1-2 (1967).</p>
         <p>When the 90th Congress met to organize in January 1967, Powell was asked to step aside
            while the oath was administered to the other members-elect. Following the administration
            of the oath to the remaining members, the House discussed the procedure to be followed
            in determining whether Powell was eligible to take his seat. After some debate, by a
            vote of 363 to 65 the House adopted House Resolution No. 1, which provided that the
            Speaker appoint a Select Committee to determine Powell's eligibility. 113 Cong. Rec.
            26-27. Although the resolution prohibited Powell from taking his seat until the House
            acted on the Select Committee's report, it did provide that he should receive all the
            pay and allowances due a member during the period.</p>
         <p>The Select Committee, composed of nine lawyer-members, issued an invitation to Powell to
            testify before the Committee. The invitation letter stated that the scope of the
            testimony and investigation would include Powell's qualifications as to age,
            citizenship, and residency; his involvement in a civil suit (in which he had been held
            in contempt); and "[m]atters of . . . alleged official misconduct since January 3,
            1961." See Hearings on <span class="star-pagination">*491</span> H. R. Res. No. 1 before
            Select Committee Pursuant to H. R. Res. No. 1, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1967)
            (hereinafter Hearings). Powell appeared at the Committee hearing held on February 8,
            1967. After the Committee denied in part Powell's request that certain adversary-type
            procedures be followed,<span class="sup">[1]</span> Powell testified. He would, however,
            give information relating only to his age, citizenship, and residency; upon the advice
            of counsel, he refused to answer other questions.</p>
         <p>On February 10, 1967, the Select Committee issued another invitation to Powell. In the
            letter, the Select Committee informed Powell that its responsibility under the House
            Resolution extended to determining not only whether he met the standing qualifications
            of Art. I, &#x9e; 2, but also to "inquir[ing] into the question of whether you should be
            punished or expelled pursuant to the powers granted . . . the House under Article I,
            Section 5, . . . of the Constitution. In other words, the Select Committee is of the
            opinion that at the conclusion of the present inquiry, it has authority to report back
            to the House recommendations with respect to . . . seating, expulsion or other
            punishment." See Hearings 110. Powell did <span class="star-pagination">*492</span> not
            appear at the next hearing, held February 14, 1967. However, his attorneys were present,
            and they informed the Committee that Powell would not testify about matters other than
            his eligibility under the standing qualifications of Art. I, &#x9e; 2. Powell's
            attorneys reasserted Powell's contention that the standing qualifications were the
            exclusive requirements for membership, and they further urged that punishment or
            expulsion was not possible until a member had been seated. See Hearings 111-113.</p>
         <p>The Committee held one further hearing at which neither Powell nor his attorneys were
            present. Then, on February 23, 1967, the Committee issued its report, finding that
            Powell met the standing qualifications of Art. I, &#x9e; 2. H. R. Rep. No. 27, 90th
            Cong., 1st Sess., 31 (1967). However, the Committee further reported that Powell had
            asserted an unwarranted privilege and immunity from the processes of the courts of New
            York; that he had wrongfully diverted House funds for the use of others and himself; and
            that he had made false reports on expenditures of foreign currency to the Committee on
            House Administration. Id., at 31-32. The Committee recommended that Powell be sworn and
            seated as a member of the 90th Congress but that he be censured by the House, fined
            $40,000 and be deprived of his seniority. Id., at 33.</p>
         <p>The report was presented to the House on March 1, 1967, and the House debated the Select
            Committee's proposed resolution. At the conclusion of the debate, by a vote of 222 to
            202 the House rejected a motion to bring the resolution to a vote. An amendment to the
            resolution was then offered; it called for the exclusion of Powell and a declaration
            that his seat was vacant. The Speaker ruled that a majority vote of the House would be
            sufficient to pass the resolution if it were so <span class="star-pagination"
               >*493</span> amended. 113 Cong. Rec. 5020. After further debate, the amendment was
            adopted by a vote of 248 to 176. Then the House adopted by a vote of 307 to 116 House
            Resolution No. 278 in its amended form, thereby excluding Powell and directing that the
            Speaker notify the Governor of New York that the seat was vacant.</p>
         <p>Powell and 13 voters of the 18th Congressional District of New York subsequently
            instituted this suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.
            Five members of the House of Representatives were named as defendants individually and
            "as representatives of a class of citizens who are presently serving . . . as members of
            the House of Representatives." John W. McCormack was named in his official capacity as
            Speaker, and the Clerk of the House of Representatives, the Sergeant at Arms and the
            Doorkeeper were named individually and in their official capacities. The complaint
            alleged that House Resolution No. 278 violated the Constitution, specifically Art. I,
            &#x9e; 2, cl. 1, because the resolution was inconsistent with the mandate that the
            members of the House shall be elected by the people of each State, and Art. I, &#x9e; 2,
            cl. 2, which, petitioners alleged, sets forth the exclusive qualifications for
               membership.<span class="sup">[2]</span> The complaint further alleged that the Clerk
            of the House threatened to refuse to perform the service for Powell to which a duly
            elected Congressman is entitled, that the Sergeant at Arms refused to pay Powell his
            salary, and that the Doorkeeper threatened to deny Powell admission to the House
            chamber.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*494</span> Petitioners asked that a three-judge court be
               convened.<span class="sup">[3]</span> Further, they requested that the District Court
            grant a permanent injunction restraining respondents from executing the House
            Resolution, and enjoining the Speaker from refusing to administer the oath, the Clerk
            from refusing to perform the duties due a Representative, the Sergeant at Arms from
            refusing to pay Powell his salary, and the Doorkeeper from refusing to admit Powell to
            the Chamber.<span class="sup">[4]</span> The complaint also requested a declaratory
            judgment that Powell's exclusion was unconstitutional.</p>
         <p>The District Court granted respondents' motion to dismiss the complaint "for want of
            jurisdiction of the subject matter." Powell v. McCormack, 266 F. Supp. 354 (D. C. D. C.
               1967).<span class="sup">[5]</span> The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
            Circuit affirmed on somewhat different grounds, with each judge of the panel filing a
            separate opinion. Powell v. McCormack, 129 U. S. App. D. C. 354, 395 F. 2d 577 (1968).
            We granted certiorari. 393 U. S. 949 (1968). While the case was pending on our docket,
            the 90th Congress officially terminated and the 91st Congress was seated. In November
            1968, Powell was again elected as the representative of the 18th Congressional District
            of New York and he was seated by the 91st Congress. The resolution seating Powell also
               <span class="star-pagination">*495</span> fined him $25,000. See H. R. Res. No. 2,
            91st Cong., 1st Sess., 115 Cong. Rec. H21 (daily ed., January 3, 1969). Respondents then
            filed a suggestion of mootness. We postponed further consideration of this suggestion to
            a hearing on the merits. 393 U. S. 1060 (1969).</p>
         <p>Respondents press upon us a variety of arguments to support the court below; they will
            be considered in the following order. (1) Events occurring subsequent to the grant of
            certiorari have rendered this litigation moot. (2) The Speech or Debate Clause of the
            Constitution, Art. I, &#x9e; 6, insulates respondents' action from judicial review. (3)
            The decision to exclude petitioner Powell is supported by the power granted to the House
            of Representatives to expel a member. (4) This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction
            over petitioners' action. (5) Even if subject matter jurisdiction is present, this
            litigation is not justiciable either under the general criteria established by this
            Court or because a political question is involved.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II.</h2>
         <p/>
         <h2>MOOTNESS.</h2>
         <p>After certiorari was granted, respondents filed a memorandum suggesting that two events
            which occurred subsequent to our grant of certiorari require that the case be dismissed
            as moot. On January 3, 1969, the House of Representatives of the 90th Congress
            officially terminated, and petitioner Powell was seated as a member of the 91st
            Congress. 115 Cong. Rec. H22 (daily ed., January 3, 1969). Respondents insist that the
            gravamen of petitioners' complaint was the failure of the 90th Congress to seat
            petitioner Powell and that, since the House of Representatives is not a continuing
               body<span class="sup">[6]</span>
            <span class="star-pagination">*496</span> and Powell has now been seated, his claims are
            moot. Petitioners counter that three issues remain unresolved and thus this litigation
            presents a "case or controversy" within the meaning of Art. III:<span class="sup"
               >[7]</span> (1) whether Powell was unconstitutionally deprived of his seniority by
            his exclusion from the 90th Congress; (2) whether the resolution of the 91st Congress
            imposing as "punishment" a $25,000 fine is a continuation of respondents' allegedly
            unconstitutional exclusion, see H. R. Res. No. 2, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 115 Cong. Rec.
            H21 (daily ed., January 3, 1969); and (3) whether Powell is entitled to salary withheld
            after his exclusion from the 90th Congress. We conclude that Powell's claim for back
            salary remains viable even though he has been seated in the 91st Congress and thus find
            it unnecessary to determine whether the other issues have become moot.<span class="sup"
               >[8]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Simply stated, a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer "live" or the
            parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome. See E. Borchard, Declaratory
               <span class="star-pagination">*497</span> Judgments 35-37 (2d ed. 1941). Where one of
            the several issues presented becomes moot, the remaining live issues supply the
            constitutional requirement of a case or controversy. See United Public Workers v.
            Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75, 86-94 (1947); 6A J. Moore, Federal Practice Â 57.13 (2d ed.
            1966). Despite Powell's obvious and continuing interest in his withheld salary,
            respondents insist that Alejandrino v. Quezon, 271 U. S. 528 (1926), leaves us no choice
            but to dismiss this litigation as moot. Alejandrino, a duly appointed Senator of the
            Philippine Islands, was suspended for one year by a resolution of the Philippine Senate
            and deprived of all "prerogatives, privileges and emoluments" for the period of his
            suspension. The Supreme Court of the Philippines refused to enjoin the suspension. By
            the time the case reached this Court, the suspension had expired and the Court dismissed
            as moot Alejandrino's request that the suspension be enjoined. Then, sua sponte,<span
               class="sup">[9]</span> the Court considered whether the possibility that Alejandrino
            was entitled to back salary required it "to retain the case for the purpose of
            determining whether he [Alejandrino] may not have a mandamus for this purpose." Id., at
            533. Characterizing the issue of Alejandrino's salary as a "mere incident" to his claim
            that the suspension was improper, the Court noted that he had not briefed the salary
            issue and that his request for mandamus did not set out with sufficient clarity the
            official or set of officials against whom the mandamus should issue. Id., at 533-534.
            The Court therefore refused to treat the salary claim and dismissed the entire action as
            moot.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*498</span> Respondents believe that Powell's salary claim
            is also a "mere incident" to his insistence that he was unconstitutionally excluded so
            that we should likewise dismiss this entire action as moot. This argument fails to grasp
            that the reason for the dismissal in Alejandrino was not that Alejandrino's deprivation
            of salary was insufficiently substantial to prevent the case from becoming moot, but
            rather that his failure to plead sufficient facts to establish his mandamus claim made
            it impossible for any court to resolve the mandamus request.<span class="sup"
               >[10]</span> By contrast, petitioners' complaint names the official responsible for
            the payment of congressional salaries and asks for both mandamus and an injunction
            against that official.<span class="sup">[11]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Furthermore, even if respondents are correct that petitioners' averments as to
            injunctive relief are not sufficiently definite, it does not follow that this litigation
            must be dismissed as moot. Petitioner Powell has not been paid his salary by virtue of
            an allegedly unconstitutional House resolution. That claim is still unresolved and hotly
            contested by clearly adverse parties. Declaratory relief has been requested, a form of
            relief not available <span class="star-pagination">*499</span> when Alejandrino was
               decided.<span class="sup">[12]</span> A court may grant declaratory relief even
            though it chooses not to issue an injunction or mandamus. See United Public Workers v.
            Mitchell, supra, at 93; cf. United States v. California, 332 U. S. 19, 25-26 (1947). A
            declaratory judgment can then be used as a predicate to further relief, including an
            injunction. 28 U. S. C. &#x9e; 2202; see Vermont Structural Slate Co. v. Tatko Brothers
            Slate Co., 253 F. 2d 29 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1958); United States Lines Co. v. Shaughnessy,
            195 F. 2d 385 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1952). Alejandrino stands only for the proposition that,
            where one claim has become moot and the pleadings are insufficient to determine whether
            the plaintiff is entitled to another remedy, the action should be dismissed as
               moot.<span class="sup">[13]</span> There is no suggestion that petitioners' averments
            as to declaratory relief are insufficient and Powell's allegedly unconstitutional
            deprivation of salary remains unresolved.</p>
         <p>Respondents further argue that Powell's "wholly incidental and subordinate" demand for
            salary is insufficient to prevent this litigation from becoming moot. They suggest that
            the "primary and principal relief" sought was the seating of petitioner Powell in the
            90th Congress rendering his presumably secondary claims not worthy of judicial
            consideration. Bond v. Floyd, 385 U. S. 116 (1966), rejects respondents' theory that the
            mootness of a "primary" claim requires a conclusion that all "secondary" claims are
            moot. At the Bond oral argument it was suggested that the expiration of the session of
            the Georgia Legislature which excluded Bond had rendered <span class="star-pagination"
               >*500</span> the case moot. We replied: "The State has not pressed this argument, and
            it could not do so, because the State has stipulated that if Bond succeeds on this
            appeal he will receive back salary for the term from which he was excluded." 385 U. S.,
            at 128, n. 4. Bond is not controlling, argue respondents, because the legislative term
            from which Bond was excluded did not end until December 31, 1966,<span class="sup"
               >[14]</span> and our decision was rendered December 5; further, when Bond was
            decided, Bond had not as yet been seated while in this case Powell has been.<span
               class="sup">[15]</span> Respondents do not tell us, however, why these factual
            distinctions create a legally significant difference between Bond and this case. We
            relied in Bond on the outstanding salary claim, not the facts respondents stress, to
            hold that the case was not moot.</p>
         <p>Finally, respondents seem to argue that Powell's proper action to recover salary is a
            suit in the Court of Claims, so that, having brought the wrong action, a dismissal for
            mootness is appropriate. The short answer to this argument is that it confuses mootness
            with whether Powell has established a right to recover against the Sergeant at Arms, a
            question which it is inappropriate to treat at this stage of the litigation.<span

            States v. Johnson, 383 U. S. 169 (1966); Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U. S. 367 (1951); and
            Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U. S. 168 (1881)ÔÇöbeen called upon to determine if allegedly
            unconstitutional action taken by legislators or legislative employees is insulated from
            judicial review by the Speech or Debate Clause. Both parties insist that their
            respective positions find support in these cases and tender for decision three distinct
            issues: (1) whether respondents in participating in the exclusion of petitioner Powell
            were "acting in the sphere of legitimate legislative activity," Tenney v. Brandhove,
            supra, at 376; (2) assuming that respondents were so acting, whether the fact that
            petitioners seek neither damages from any of the respondents nor a criminal prosecution
            lifts the bar of the clause;<span class="sup">[18]</span> and (3) even if this <span
               class="star-pagination">*502</span> action may not be maintained against a
            Congressman, whether those respondents who are merely employees of the House may plead
            the bar of the clause. We find it necessary to treat only the last of these issues.</p>
         <p>The Speech or Debate Clause, adopted by the Constitutional Convention without debate or
               opposition,<span class="sup">[19]</span> finds its roots in the conflict between
            Parliament and the Crown culminating in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the English
            Bill of Rights of 1689.<span class="sup">[20]</span> Drawing upon this history, we
            concluded in United States v. Johnson, supra, at 181, that the purpose of this clause
            was "to prevent intimidation [of legislators] by the executive and accountability before
            a possibly hostile judiciary." Although the clause sprang from a fear of seditious libel
            actions instituted by the Crown to punish unfavorable speeches made in Parliament,<span
               class="sup">[21]</span> we have held that it would be a "narrow view" to confine the
            protection of the Speech or Debate Clause to words spoken in debate. Committee reports,
            resolutions, and the act of voting are equally covered, as are "things generally done in
            a session of the House by one of its members in relation to the business before it."
            Kilbourn v. Thompson, supra, at 204. Furthermore, the clause not only provides a <span
               class="star-pagination">*503</span> defense on the merits but also protects a
            legislator from the burden of defending himself. Dombrowski v. Eastland, supra, at 85;
            see Tenney v. Brandhove, supra, at 377.</p>
         <p>Our cases make it clear that the legislative immunity created by the Speech or Debate
            Clause performs an important function in representative government. It insures that
            legislators are free to represent the interests of their constituents without fear that
            they will be later called to task in the courts for that representation. Thus, in Tenney
            v. Brandhove, supra, at 373, the Court quoted the writings of James Wilson as
            illuminating the reason for legislative immunity: "In order to enable and encourage a
            representative of the publick to discharge his publick trust with firmness and success,
            it is indispensably necessary, that he should enjoy the fullest liberty of speech, and
            that he should be protected from the resentment of every one, however powerful, to whom
            the exercise of that liberty may occasion offence."<span class="sup">[22]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Legislative immunity does not, of course, bar all judicial review of legislative acts.
            That issue was settled by implication as early as 1803, see Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch
            137, and expressly in Kilbourn v. Thompson, the first of this Court's cases interpreting
            the reach of the Speech or Debate Clause. Challenged in Kilbourn was the
            constitutionality of a House Resolution ordering the arrest and imprisonment of a
            recalcitrant witness who had refused to respond to a subpoena issued by a House
            investigating committee. While holding that the Speech or Debate Clause barred
            Kilbourn's action for false imprisonment brought against several members of the House,
            the Court nevertheless reached the merits of Kilbourn's attack and decided that, since
            the House had no power to punish for contempt, Kilbourn's imprisonment <span
               class="star-pagination">*504</span> pursuant to the resolution was unconstitutional.
            It therefore allowed Kilbourn to bring his false imprisonment action against Thompson,
            the House's Sergeant at Arms, who had executed the warrant for Kilbourn's arrest.</p>
         <p>The Court first articulated in Kilbourn and followed in Dombrowski v. Eastland<span
               class="sup">[23]</span> the doctrine that, although an action against a Congressman
            may be barred by the Speech or Debate Clause, legislative employees who participated in
            the unconstitutional activity are responsible for their acts. Despite the fact that
            petitioners brought this suit against several House employeesÔÇöthe Sergeant at Arms,
            the Doorkeeper and the ClerkÔÇöas well as several Congressmen, respondents argue that
            Kilbourn and Dombrowski are distinguishable. Conceding that in Kilbourn the presence of
            the Sergeant at Arms and in Dombrowski the presence of a congressional subcommittee
            counsel as defendants in the litigation allowed judicial review of the challenged
            congressional action, respondents urge that both cases concerned an affirmative act
            performed by the employee outside the House having a direct effect upon a private
            citizen. Here, they continue, the relief sought relates to actions taken by House agents
            solely within the House. Alternatively, respondents insist that Kilbourn and Dombrowski
            prayed for damages while petitioner Powell asks that the Sergeant at Arms disburse
            funds, an assertedly greater interference with the legislative process. We reject the
            proffered distinctions.</p>
         <p>That House employees are acting pursuant to express orders of the House does not bar
            judicial review of the constitutionality of the underlying legislative decision. <span
               class="star-pagination">*505</span> Kilbourn decisively settles this question, since
            the Sergeant at Arms was held liable for false imprisonment even though he did nothing
            more than execute the House Resolution that Kilbourn be arrested and imprisoned.<span
               class="sup">[24]</span> Respondents' suggestions thus ask us to distinguish between
            affirmative acts of House employees and situations in which the House orders its
            employees not to act or between actions for damages and claims for salary. We can find
            no basis in either the history of the Speech or Debate Clause or our cases for either
            distinction. The purpose of the protection afforded legislators is not to forestall
            judicial review of legislative action but to insure that legislators are not distracted
            from or hindered in the performance of their legislative tasks by being called into
            court to defend their actions. A legislator is no more or no less hindered or distracted
            by litigation against a legislative employee calling into question the employee's
            affirmative action than he would be by a lawsuit questioning the employee's failure to
            act. Nor is the distraction or hindrance increased because the claim is for salary
            rather than damages, or because the litigation questions action taken by the employee
            within rather than without the House. Freedom of legislative activity and the purposes
            of the Speech or Debate Clause are fully protected if legislators are relieved of the
            burden of defending themselves.<span class="sup">[25]</span> In Kilbourn and Dombrowski
               <span class="star-pagination">*506</span> we thus dismissed the action against
            members of Congress but did not regard the Speech or Debate Clause as a bar to reviewing
            the merits of the challenged congressional action since congressional employees were
            also sued. Similarly, though this action may be dismissed against the Congressmen
            petitioners are entitled to maintain their action against House employees and to
            judicial review of the propriety of the decision to exclude petitioner Powell.<span
               class="sup">[26]</span> As was said in Kilbourn, in language which time has not
            dimmed:</p> "Especially is it competent and proper for this court to consider whether
         its [the legislature's] proceedings are in conformity with the Constitution and laws,
         because, living under a written constitution, no branch or department of the government is
         supreme; and it is the province and duty of the judicial department to determine in cases
         regularly brought before them, whether the powers of any branch of the government, and even
         those of the legislature in the enactment of laws, have been exercised in conformity to the
         Constitution; and if they have not, to treat their acts as null and void." 103 U. S., at
         199. <p/>
         <h2>IV.</h2>
         <p/>
         <h2>EXCLUSION OR EXPULSION.</h2>
         <p>The resolution excluding petitioner Powell was adopted by a vote in excess of two-thirds
            of the 434 Members of <span class="star-pagination">*507</span> CongressÔÇö307 to 116.
            113 Cong. Rec. 5037-5038. Article I, &#x9e; 5, grants the House authority to expel a
            member "with the Concurrence of two thirds."<span class="sup">[27]</span> Respondents
            assert that the House may expel a member for any reason whatsoever and that, since a
            two-thirds vote was obtained, the procedure by which Powell was denied his seat in the
            90th Congress should be regarded as an expulsion, not an exclusion. Cautioning us not to
            exalt form over substance, respondents quote from the concurring opinion of Judge
            McGowan in the court below:</p> "Appellant Powell's cause of action for a judicially
         compelled seating thus boils down, in my view, to the narrow issue of whether a member
         found by his colleagues . . . to have engaged in official misconduct must, because of the
         accidents of timing, be formally admitted before he can be either investigated or expelled.
         The sponsor of the motion to exclude stated on the floor that he was proceeding on the
         theory that the power to expel included the power to exclude, provided a 2/3 vote was
         forthcoming. It was. Therefore, success for Mr. Powell on the merits would mean that the
         District Court must admonish the House that it is form, not substance, that should govern
         in great affairs, and accordingly command the House members to act out a charade." 129 U.
         S. App. D. C., at 383-384, 395 F. 2d, at 606-607. <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*508</span> Although respondents repeatedly urge this
            Court not to speculate as to the reasons for Powell's exclusion, their attempt to equate
            exclusion with expulsion would require a similar speculation that the House would have
            voted to expel Powell had it been faced with that question. Powell had not been seated
            at the time House Resolution No. 278 was debated and passed. After a motion to bring the
            Select Committee's proposed resolution to an immediate vote had been defeated, an
            amendment was offered which mandated Powell's exclusion.<span class="sup">[28]</span>
            Mr. Celler, chairman of the Select Committee, then posed a parliamentary inquiry to
            determine whether a two-thirds vote was necessary to pass the resolution if so amended
            "in the sense that it might amount to an expulsion." 113 Cong. Rec. 5020. The Speaker
            replied that "action by a majority vote would be in accordance with the rules." Ibid.
            Had the amendment been regarded as an attempt to expel Powell, a two-thirds vote would
            have been constitutionally required. The Speaker ruled that the House was voting to
            exclude Powell, and we will not speculate what the result might have been if Powell had
            been seated and expulsion proceedings subsequently instituted.</p>
         <p>Nor is the distinction between exclusion and expulsion merely one of form. The
            misconduct for which Powell was charged occurred prior to the convening of the 90th
            Congress. On several occasions the House has debated whether a member can be expelled
            for actions taken during a prior Congress and the House's own manual of procedure
            applicable in the 90th Congress states that "both Houses have distrusted their power to
            punish in such cases." Rules of the House of Representatives, H. R. Doc. No. 529, 89th
            Cong., 2d Sess., 25 (1967); <span class="star-pagination">*509</span> see G. Galloway,
            History of the House of Representatives 32 (1961). The House rules manual reflects
            positions taken by prior Congresses. For example, the report of the Select Committee
            appointed to consider the expulsion of John W. Langley states unequivocally that the
            House will not expel a member for misconduct committed during an earlier Congress:</p>
         "[I]t must be said that with practical uniformity the precedents in such cases are to the
         effect that the House will not expel a Member for reprehensible action prior to his
         election as a Member, not even for conviction for an offense. On May 23, 1884, Speaker
         Carlisle decided that the House had no right to punish a Member for any offense alleged to
         have been committed previous to the time when he was elected a Member, and added, `That has
         been so frequently decided in the House that it is no longer a matter of dispute.' " H. R.
         Rep. No. 30, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., 1-2 (1925).<span class="sup">[29]</span>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*510</span> Members of the House having expressed a belief
            that such strictures apply to its own power to expel, we will not assume that two-thirds
            of its members would have expelled Powell for his prior conduct had the Speaker
            announced that House Resolution No. 278 was for expulsion rather than exclusion.<span
               class="sup">[30]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Finally, the proceedings which culminated in Powell's exclusion cast considerable doubt
            upon respondents' assumption that the two-thirds vote necessary to expel would have been
            mustered. These proceedings have been succinctly described by Congressman Eckhardt:</p>
         "The House voted 202 votes for the previous question<span class="sup">[31]</span> leading
         toward the adoption of the [Select] Committee report. It voted 222 votes against the
         previous question, opening the floor for the Curtis Amendment which ultimately excluded
         Powell. <span class="star-pagination">*511</span> "Upon adoption of the Curtis Amendment,
         the vote again fell short of two-thirds, being 248 yeas to 176 nays. Only on the final
         vote, adopting the Resolution as amended, was more than a two-thirds vote obtained, the
         vote being 307 yeas to 116 nays. On this last vote, as a practical matter, members who
         would not have denied Powell a seat if they were given the choice to punish him had to cast
         an aye vote or else record themselves as opposed to the only punishment that was likely to
         come before the House. Had the matter come up through the processes of expulsion, it
         appears that the two-thirds vote would have failed, and then members would have been able
         to apply a lesser penalty."<span class="sup">[32]</span>
         <p>We need express no opinion as to the accuracy of Congressman Eckhardt's prediction that
            expulsion proceedings would have produced a different result. However, the House's own
            views of the extent of its power to expel <span class="star-pagination">*512</span>
            combined with the Congressman's analysis counsel that exclusion and expulsion are not
            fungible proceedings. The Speaker ruled that House Resolution No. 278 contemplated an
            exclusion proceeding. We must reject respondents' suggestion that we overrule the
            Speaker and hold that, although the House manifested an intent to exclude Powell, its
            action should be tested by whatever standards may govern an expulsion.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>V.</h2>
         <p/>
         <h2>SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION.</h2>
         <p>As we pointed out in Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 198 (1962), there is a significant
            difference between determining whether a federal court has "jurisdiction of the subject
            matter" and determining whether a cause over which a court has subject matter
            jurisdiction is "justiciable." The District Court determined that "to decide this case
            on the merits . . . would constitute a clear violation of the doctrine of separation of
            powers" and then dismissed the complaint "for want of jurisdiction of the subject
            matter." Powell v. McCormack, 266 F. Supp. 354, 359, 360 (D. C. D. C. 1967). However, as
            the Court of Appeals correctly recognized, the doctrine of separation of powers is more
            properly considered in determining whether the case is "justiciable." We agree with the
            unanimous conclusion of the Court of Appeals that the District Court had jurisdiction
            over the subject matter of this case.<span class="sup">[33]</span> However, for reasons
            set forth in Part VI, infra, we disagree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that this
            case is not justiciable.</p>
         <p>In Baker v. Carr, supra, we noted that a federal district court lacks jurisdiction over
            the subject matter (1) if the <span class="star-pagination">*513</span> cause does not
            "arise under" the Federal Constitution, laws, or treaties (or fall within one of the
            other enumerated categories of Art. III); or (2) if it is not a "case or controversy"
            within the meaning of that phrase in Art. III; or (3) if the cause is not one described
            by any jurisdictional statute. And, as in Baker v. Carr, supra, our determination (see
            Part VI, B (1) infra) that this cause presents no nonjusticiable "political question"
            disposes of respondents' contentions<span class="sup">[34]</span> that this cause is not
            a "case or controversy."<span class="sup">[35]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Respondents first contend that this is not a case "arising under" the Constitution
            within the meaning of Art. III. They emphasize that Art. I, &#x9e; 5, assigns to each
            House of Congress the power to judge the elections and qualifications of its own members
            and to punish its members for disorderly behavior. Respondents also note that under Art.
            I, &#x9e; 3, the Senate has the "sole power" to try all impeachments. Respondents argue
            that these delegations (to "judge," to "punish," and to "try") to the Legislative Branch
            are explicit grants of "judicial power" to the Congress and constitute specific
            exceptions <span class="star-pagination">*514</span> to the general mandate of Art. III
            that the "judicial power" shall be vested in the federal courts. Thus, respondents
            maintain, the "power conferred on the courts by article III does not authorize this
            Court to do anything more than declare its lack of jurisdiction to proceed."<span
               class="sup">[36]</span>
         </p>
         <p>We reject this contention. Article III, &#x9e; 1, provides that the "judicial Power . .
            . shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may
            . . . establish." Further, &#x9e; 2 mandates that the "judicial Power shall extend to
            all Cases . . . arising under this Constitution. . . ." It has long been held that a
            suit "arises under" the Constitution if a petitioner's claim "will be sustained if the
            Constitution . . . [is] given one construction and will be defeated if [it is] given
               another."<span class="sup">[37]</span>Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 685 (1946). See
            King County v. Seattle School District No. 1, 263 U. S. 361, 363-364 (1923). Cf. Osborn
            v. Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat. 738 (1824). See generally C. Wright, Federal
            Courts 48-52 (1963). Thus, this case clearly is one "arising under" the Constitution as
            the Court has interpreted that phrase. Any bar to federal courts reviewing the judgments
            made by the House or Senate in excluding a member arises from the allocation of powers
            between the two branches of the Federal Government (a question of justiciability), and
            not from the petitioners' failure to state a claim based on federal law.</p>
         <p>Respondents next contend that the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that petitioners'
            suit is authorized by a jurisdictional statute, i. e., 28 U. S. C. &#x9e; 1331 (a).
               <span class="star-pagination">*515</span> Section 1331 (a) provides that district
            courts shall have jurisdiction in "all civil actions wherein the matter in controversy .
            . . arises under the Constitution . . . ." Respondents urge that even though a case may
            "arise under the Constitution" for purposes of Art. III, it does not necessarily "arise
            under the Constitution" for purposes of &#x9e; 1331 (a). Although they recognize there
            is little legislative history concerning the enactment of &#x9e; 1331 (a), respondents
            argue that the history of the period when the section was first enacted indicates that
            the drafters did not intend to include suits questioning the exclusion of Congressmen in
            this grant of "federal question" jurisdiction.</p>
         <p>Respondents claim that the passage of the Force Act<span class="sup">[38]</span> in 1870
            lends support to their interpretation of the intended scope of &#x9e; 1331. The Force
            Act gives the district courts jurisdiction over "any civil action to recover possession
            of any office . . . wherein it appears that the sole question . . . arises out of denial
            of the right to vote . . . on account of race, color or previous condition of
            servitude." However, the Act specifically excludes suits concerning the office of
            Congressman. Respondents maintain that this exclusion demonstrates Congress' intention
            to prohibit federal courts from entertaining suits regarding the seating of
            Congressmen.</p>
         <p>We have noted that the grant of jurisdiction in &#x9e; 1331 (a), while made in the
            language used in Art. III, is not in all respects co-extensive with the potential for
            federal jurisdiction found in Art. III. See Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U. S. 241, 246, n. 8
            (1967). Nevertheless, it has generally been recognized that the intent of the drafters
            was to provide a broad jurisdictional grant to the federal courts. See, e. g., Mishkin,
            The Federal "Question" in the District Courts, 53 Col. L. <span class="star-pagination"
               >*516</span> Rev. 157, 160 (1953); Chadbourn &amp;amp; Levin, Original Jurisdiction
            of Federal Questions, 90 U. Pa. L. Rev. 639, 644-645 (1942). And, as noted above, the
            resolution of this case depends directly on construction of the Constitution. The Court
            has consistently held such suits are authorized by the statute. Bell v. Hood, supra;
            King County v. Seattle School District No. 1, supra. See, e. g., Gully v. First Nat.
            Bank in Meridian, 299 U. S. 109, 112 (1936); The Fair v. Kohler Die &amp;amp; Specialty
            Co., 228 U. S. 22, 25 (1913).</p>
         <p>As respondents recognize, there is nothing in the wording or legislative history of
            &#x9e; 1331 or in the decisions of this Court which would indicate that there is any
            basis for the interpretation they would give that section. Nor do we think the passage
            of the Force Act indicates that &#x9e; 1331 does not confer jurisdiction in this case.
            The Force Act is limited to election challenges where a denial of the right to vote in
            violation of the Fifteenth Amendment is alleged. See 28 U. S. C. &#x9e; 1344. Further,
            the Act was passed five years before the original version of &#x9e; 1331 was enacted.
            While it might be inferred that Congress intended to give each House the exclusive power
            to decide congressional election challenges,<span class="sup">[39]</span> there is
            absolutely no indication that the passage of this Act evidences an intention to impose
            other restrictions on the broad grant of jurisdiction in &#x9e; 1331.</p>

         <h2>VI.</h2>
         <p/>
         <h2>JUSTICIABILITY.</h2>
         <p>Having concluded that the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the District Court had
            jurisdiction over the subject matter, we turn to the question whether the case is
            justiciable. Two determinations must be made in this regard. First, we must decide
            whether the claim <span class="star-pagination">*517</span> presented and the relief
            sought are of the type which admit of judicial resolution. Second, we must determine
            whether the structure of the Federal Government renders the issue presented a "political
            question"ÔÇöthat is, a question which is not justiciable in federal court because of the
            separation of powers provided by the Constitution.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>A. <i>General Considerations.</i>
         </h2>
         <p>In deciding generally whether a claim is justiciable, a court must determine whether
            "the duty asserted can be judicially identified and its breach judicially determined,
            and whether protection for the right asserted can be judicially molded." Baker v. Carr,
            supra, at 198. Respondents do not seriously contend that the duty asserted and its
            alleged breach cannot be judicially determined. If petitioners are correct, the House
            had a duty to seat Powell once it determined he met the standing requirements set forth
            in the Constitution. It is undisputed that he met those requirements and that he was
            nevertheless excluded.</p>
         <p>Respondents do maintain, however, that this case is not justiciable because, they
            assert, it is impossible for a federal court to "mold effective relief for resolving
            this case." Respondents emphasize that petitioners asked for coercive relief against the
            officers of the House, and, they contend, federal courts cannot issue mandamus or
            injunctions compelling officers or employees of the House to perform specific official
            acts. Respondents rely primarily on the Speech or Debate Clause to support this
            contention.</p>
         <p>We need express no opinion about the appropriateness of coercive relief in this case,
            for petitioners sought a declaratory judgment, a form of relief the District Court could
            have issued. The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U. S. C. &#x9e; 2201, provides that a
            district court may "declare the rights . . . of any interested party . . . whether or
            not further relief is or could be sought." The <span class="star-pagination">*518</span>
            availability of declaratory relief depends on whether there is a live dispute between
            the parties, Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U. S. 103 (1969), and a request for declaratory
            relief may be considered independently of whether other forms of relief are appropriate.
            See United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75, 93 (1947); 6A J. Moore, Federal
            Practice Â 57.08 [3] (2d ed. 1966); cf. United States v. California, 332 U. S. 19, 25-26
            (1947). We thus conclude that in terms of the general criteria of justiciability, this
            case is justiciable.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B. <i>Political Question Doctrine.</i>
         </h2>
         <p/>
         <h2>1. Textually Demonstrable Constitutional Commitment.</h2>
         <p>Respondents maintain that even if this case is otherwise justiciable, it presents only a
            political question. It is well established that the federal courts will not adjudicate
            political questions. See, e. g., Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433 (1939); Oetjen v.
            Central Leather Co., 246 U. S. 297 (1918). In Baker v. Carr, supra, we noted that
            political questions are not justiciable primarily because of the separation of powers
            within the Federal Government. After reviewing our decisions in this area, we concluded
            that on the surface of any case held to involve a political question was at least one of
            the following formulations:</p> "a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of
         the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and
         manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial
         policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of
         a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due
         coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a
         political decision already made; or the potentiality <span class="star-pagination"
            >*519</span> of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on
         one question." 369 U. S., at 217. <p>Respondents' first contention is that this case
            presents a political question because under Art. I, &#x9e; 5, there has been a
            "textually demonstrable constitutional commitment" to the House of the "adjudicatory
            power" to determine Powell's qualifications. Thus it is argued that the House, and the
            House alone, has power to determine who is qualified to be a member.<span class="sup"
               >[40]</span>
         </p>
         <p>In order to determine whether there has been a textual commitment to a co-ordinate
            department of the Government, we must interpret the Constitution. In other words, we
            must first determine what power the Constitution confers upon the House through Art. I,
            &#x9e; 5, before we can determine to what extent, if any, the exercise of that power is
            subject to judicial review. Respondents <span class="star-pagination">*520</span>
            maintain that the House has broad power under &#x9e; 5, and, they argue, the House may
            determine which are the qualifications necessary for membership. On the other hand,
            petitioners allege that the Constitution provides that an elected representative may be
            denied his seat only if the House finds he does not meet one of the standing
            qualifications expressly prescribed by the Constitution.</p>
         <p>If examination of &#x9e; 5 disclosed that the Constitution gives the House judicially
            unreviewable power to set qualifications for membership and to judge whether prospective
            members meet those qualifications, further review of the House determination might well
            be barred by the political question doctrine. On the other hand, if the Constitution
            gives the House power to judge only whether elected members possess the three standing
            qualifications set forth in the Constitution,<span class="sup">[41]</span> further
            consideration would be necessary to determine whether any of the other formulations of
            the political question doctrine are <span class="star-pagination">*521</span>
            "inextricable from the case at bar."<span class="sup">[42]</span>Baker v. Carr, supra,
            at 217.</p>
         <p>In other words, whether there is a "textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of
            the issue to a co-ordinate political department" of government and what is the scope of
            such commitment are questions we must resolve for the first time in this case.<span
               class="sup">[43]</span> For, as we pointed out in Baker v. Carr, supra, "[d]eciding
            whether a matter has in any measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch
            of government, or whether the action of that branch exceeds whatever authority has been
            committed, is itself a delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation, and is a
            responsibility of this Court as ultimate interpreter of the Constitution." Id., at
            211.</p>
         <p>In order to determine the scope of any "textual commitment" under Art. I, &#x9e; 5, we
            necessarily must determine the meaning of the phrase to "be the Judge of the
            Qualifications of its own Members." Petitioners argue that the records of the debates
            during the Constitutional Convention; available commentary from the post-Convention,
            pre-ratification period; and early congressional applications of Art. I, &#x9e; 5,
            support their construction of the section. Respondents insist, however, that a careful
            examination of the pre-Convention practices of the English Parliament and American
            colonial assemblies demonstrates that by 1787, a legislature's power to judge the
            qualifications of its members was generally understood <span class="star-pagination"
               >*522</span> to encompass exclusion or expulsion on the ground that an individual's
            character or past conduct rendered him unfit to serve. When the Constitution and the
            debates over its adoption are thus viewed in historical perspective, argue respondents,
            it becomes clear that the "qualifications" expressly set forth in the Constitution were
            not meant to limit the long-recognized legislative power to exclude or expel at will,
            but merely to establish "standing incapacities," which could be altered only by a
            constitutional amendment. Our examination of the relevant historical materials leads us
            to the conclusion that petitioners are correct and that the Constitution leaves the
               House<span class="sup">[44]</span> without authority to exclude any person, duly
            elected by his constituents, who meets all the requirements for membership expressly
            prescribed in the Constitution.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>a. The Pre-Convention Precedents.</h2>
         <p>Since our rejection of respondents' interpretation of &#x9e; 5 results in significant
            measure from a disagreement with their historical analysis, we must consider the
            relevant historical antecedents in considerable detail. As do respondents, we begin with
            the English and colonial precedents.</p>
         <p>The earliest English exclusion precedent appears to be a declaration by the House of
            Commons in 1553 "that Alex. Nowell, being Prebendary [i. e., a clergyman] in
            Westminster, and thereby having voice in the Convocation House, cannot be a member of
            this House . . . ." J. Tanner, Tudor Constitutional Documents: A. D. 1485-1603, p. 596
            (2d ed. 1930). This decision, however, was <span class="star-pagination">*523</span>
            consistent with a long-established tradition that clergy who participated in their own
            representative assemblies or convocations were ineligible for membership in the House of
               Commons.<span class="sup">[45]</span> See 1 E. Porritt, The Unreformed House of
            Commons 125 (1963); T. Taswell-Langmead's English Constitutional History 142-143 (11th
            ed. T. Plucknett 1960). The traditional ineligibility of clergymen was recognized as a
            standing incapacity.<span class="sup">[46]</span> See 1 W. Blackstone's Commentaries
            *175. Nowell's exclusion, therefore, is irrelevant to the present case, for petitioners
            concedeÔÇöand we agreeÔÇöthat if Powell had not met one of the standing qualifications
            set forth in the Constitution, he could have been excluded under Art. I, &#x9e; 5. The
            earliest colonial exclusions also fail to support respondents' theory.<span class="sup"
               >[47]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*524</span> Respondents' remaining 16th and 17th century
            English precedents all are cases of expulsion, although some were for misdeeds not
            encompassed within recognized standing incapacities existing either at the time of the
            expulsions or at the time the Constitution was drafted in 1787.<span class="sup"
               >[48]</span> Although these early expulsion orders occasionally contained statements
            suggesting that the individual expelled was thereafter ineligible for re-election, at
            least for the duration of the Parliament from which he was expelled,<span class="sup"
               >[49]</span>
            <span class="star-pagination">*525</span> there is no indication that any were
            re-elected and thereafter excluded. Respondents' colonial precedents during this period
            follow a similar pattern.<span class="sup">[50]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Apparently the re-election of an expelled member first occurred in 1712. The House of
            Commons had expelled Robert Walpole for receiving kickbacks for contracts relating to
            "foraging the Troops," 17 H. C. Jour. 28, and committed him to the Tower. Nevertheless,
            two months later he was re-elected. The House thereupon resolved "[t]hat Robert Walpole,
            Esquire, having been, this Session of Parliament, committed a Prisoner to the Tower of
            London, and expelled [from] this House, . . . is, incapable of being elected a Member to
            serve in this present Parliament . . . ." Id., at 128. (Second emphasis added.) A new
            election was ordered, and Walpole was not re-elected. At least two similar exclusions
            after an initial expulsion were effected in the American colonies during the first half
            of the 18th century.<span class="sup">[51]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*526</span> Respondents urge that the Walpole case
            provides strong support for their conclusion that the pre-Convention English and
            colonial practice was that members-elect could be excluded for their prior misdeeds at
            the sole discretion of the legislative body to which they had been elected. However,
            this conclusion overlooks an important limiting characteristic of the Walpole case and
            of both the colonial exclusion cases on which respondents rely: the excluded member had
            been previously expelled. Moreover, Walpole was excluded only for the remainder of the
            Parliament from which he had been expelled. "The theory seems to have been that
            expulsion lasted as long as the parliament . . . ." Taswell-Langmead, supra, at 584, n.
            99. Accord, 1 W. Blackstone's Commentaries *176. Thus, Walpole's exclusion justifies
            only the proposition that an expulsion lasted for the remainder of the particular
            Parliament, and the expelled member was therefore subject to subsequent exclusion if
            reelected prior to the next general election. The two colonial cases arguably support a
            somewhat broader principle, i. e., that the assembly could permanently expel. Apparently
            the colonies did not consistently adhere to the theory that an expulsion lasted only
            until the election of a new assembly. M. Clarke, Parliamentary Privilege in the American
            Colonies 196-202 (1943).<span class="sup">[52]</span> Clearly, however, none of these
            cases supports respondents' contention that by the 18th century the English Parliament
               <span class="star-pagination">*527</span> and colonial assemblies had assumed
            absolute discretion to exclude any member-elect they deemed unfit to serve. Rather, they
            seem to demonstrate that a member could be excluded only if he had first been
            expelled.</p>
         <p>Even if these cases could be construed to support respondents' contention, their
            precedential value was nullified prior to the Constitutional Convention. By 1782, after
            a long struggle, the arbitrary exercise of the power to exclude was unequivocally
            repudiated by a House of Commons resolution which ended the most notorious English
            election dispute of the 18th centuryÔÇö the John Wilkes case. While serving as a member
            of Parliament in 1763, Wilkes published an attack on a recent peace treaty with France,
            calling it a product of bribery and condemning the Crown's ministers as " `the tools of
            despotism and corruption.' " R. Postgate, That Devil Wilkes 53 (1929). Wilkes and others
            who were involved with the publication in which the attack appeared were arrested.<span
               class="sup">[53]</span> Prior to Wilkes' trial, the House of Commons expelled him for
            publishing "a false, scandalous, and seditious libel." 15 Parl. Hist. Eng. 1393 (1764).
            Wilkes then fled to France and was subsequently sentenced to exile. 9 L. Gipson, The
            British Empire Before the American Revolution 37 (1956).</p>
         <p>Wilkes returned to England in 1768, the same year in which the Parliament from which he
            had been expelled was dissolved. He was elected to the next Parliament, and he then
            surrendered himself to the Court of King's Bench. Wilkes was convicted of seditious
            libel and sentenced to 22 months' imprisonment. The new Parliament <span
               class="star-pagination">*528</span> declared him ineligible for membership and
            ordered that he be "expelled this House." 16 Parl. Hist. Eng. 545 (1769). Although
            Wilkes was re-elected to fill the vacant seat three times, each time the same Parliament
            declared him ineligible and refused to seat him. See 11 Gipson, supra, at 207-215.<span
               class="sup">[54]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Wilkes was released from prison in 1770 and was again elected to Parliament in 1774. For
            the next several years, he unsuccessfully campaigned to have the resolutions expelling
            him and declaring him incapable of re-election expunged from the record. Finally, in
            1782, the House of Commons voted to expunge them, resolving that the prior House actions
            were "subversive of the rights of the whole body of electors of this kingdom." 22 Parl.
            Hist. Eng. 1411 (1782).</p>
         <p>With the successful resolution of Wilkes' long and bitter struggle for the right of the
            British electorate to be represented by men of their own choice, it is evident that, on
            the eve of the Constitutional Convention, English precedent stood for the proposition
            that "the law of the land had regulated the qualifications of members to serve in
            parliament" and those qualifications were "not occasional but fixed." 16 Parl. Hist.
            Eng. 589, 590 (1769). Certainly English practice did not support, nor had it ever
            supported, respondents' assertion that the power to judge qualifications was generally
            understood to encompass the right to exclude members-elect for general misconduct not
            within standing qualifications. With the repudiation in 1782 of the only two precedents
               <span class="star-pagination">*529</span> for excluding a member-elect who had been
            previously expelled,<span class="sup">[55]</span> it appears that the House of Commons
            also repudiated any "control over the eligibility of candidates, except in the
            administration of the laws which define their [standing] qualifications." T. May's
            Parliamentary Practice 66 (13th ed. T. Webster 1924). See Taswell-Langmead, supra, at
               585.<span class="sup">[56]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The resolution of the Wilkes case similarly undermined the precedential value of the
            earlier colonial exclusions, for the principles upon which they had been based were
            repudiated by the very body the colonial assemblies sought to imitate and whose
            precedents they generally followed. See Clarke, supra, at 54, 59-60, 196. Thus, in 1784
            the Council of Censors of the Pennsylvania Assembly<span class="sup">[57]</span>
            denounced the prior expulsion of an unnamed assemblyman, ruling that his expulsion had
            not been effected in conformity with the recently enacted Pennsylvania
               Constitution.<span class="sup">[58]</span> In the course of its report, the <span
               class="star-pagination">*530</span> Council denounced by name the Parliamentary
            exclusions of both Walpole and Wilkes, stating that they "reflected dishonor on none but
            the authors of these violences." Pennsylvania Convention Proceedings: 1776 and 1790, p.

         <p>Wilkes' struggle and his ultimate victory had a significant impact in the American
            colonies. His advocacy of libertarian causes<span class="sup">[59]</span> and his
            pursuit of the right to be <span class="star-pagination">*531</span> seated in
            Parliament became a cause cÚlebre for the colonists. "[T]he cry of `Wilkes and Liberty'
            echoed loudly across the Atlantic Ocean as wide publicity was given to every step of
            Wilkes's public career in the colonial press . . . . The reaction in America took on
            significant proportions. Colonials tended to identify their cause with that of Wilkes.
            They saw him as a popular hero and a martyr to the struggle for liberty. . . . They
            named towns, counties, and even children in his honour." 11 Gipson, supra, at 222.<span
               class="sup">[60]</span> It is within this historical context that we must examine the
            Convention debates in 1787, just five years after Wilkes' final victory.</p>

         <h2>
            <span class="star-pagination">*532</span> b. Convention Debates.</h2>
         <p>Relying heavily on Charles Warren's analysis<span class="sup">[61]</span> of the
            Convention debates, petitioners argue that the proceedings manifest the Framers'
            unequivocal intention to deny either branch of Congress the authority to add to or
            otherwise vary the membership qualifications expressly set forth in the Constitution. We
            do not completely agree, for the debates are subject to other interpretations. However,
            we have concluded that the records of the debates, viewed in the context of the bitter
            struggle for the right to freely choose representatives which had recently concluded in
            England and in light of the distinction the Framers made between the power to expel and
            the power to exclude, indicate that petitioners' ultimate conclusion is correct.</p>
         <p>The Convention opened in late May 1787. By the end of July, the delegates adopted, with
            a minimum of debate, age requirements for membership in both the Senate and the House.
            The Convention then appointed a Committee of Detail to draft a constitution
            incorporating these and other resolutions adopted during the preceding months. Two days
            after the Committee was appointed, George Mason, of Virginia, moved that the Committee
            consider a clause " `requiring certain qualifications of landed property &amp;amp;
            citizenship' " and disqualifying from membership in Congress persons who had unsettled
            accounts or who were indebted to the United States. 2 Farrand 121. A vigorous debate
            ensued. Charles Pinckney and General Charles C. Pinckney, both of South Carolina, moved
            to extend these incapacities to both the judicial and executive branches of the new
            government. But John Dickinson, of Delaware, opposed the inclusion of any statement of
            qualifications in the Constitution. He argued that it would be "impossible <span
               class="star-pagination">*533</span> to make a compleat one, and a partial one would
            by implication tie up the hands of the Legislature from supplying the omissions." Id.,
            at 123.<span class="sup">[62]</span> Dickinson's argument was rejected; and, after
            eliminating the disqualification of debtors and the limitation to "landed" property, the
            Convention adopted Mason's proposal to instruct the Committee of Detail to draft a
            property qualification. Id., at 116-117.</p>
         <p>The Committee reported in early August, proposing no change in the age requirement;
            however, it did recommend adding citizenship and residency requirements for membership.
            After first debating what the precise requirements should be, on August 8, 1787, the
            delegates unanimously adopted the three qualifications embodied in Art. I, &#x9e; 2.
            Id., at 213.<span class="sup">[63]</span>
         </p>
         <p>On August 10, the Convention considered the Committee of Detail's proposal that the
            "Legislature of the United States shall have authority to establish such uniform
            qualifications of the members of each House, with regard to property, as to the said
            Legislature shall seem expedient." Id., at 179. The debate on this proposal discloses
            much about the views of the Framers on the issue of qualifications. For example, James
            Madison urged its rejection, stating that the proposal would vest</p> "an improper
         &amp;amp; dangerous power in the Legislature. The qualifications of electors and elected
         were fundamental articles in a Republican Govt. and ought to be fixed by the Constitution.
         If the Legislature <span class="star-pagination">*534</span> could regulate those of
         either, it can by degrees subvert the Constitution. A Republic may be converted into an
         aristocracy or oligarchy as well by limiting the number capable of being elected, as the
         number authorised to elect. . . . It was a power also, which might be made subservient to
         the views of one faction agst. another. Qualifications founded on artificial distinctions
         may be devised, by the stronger in order to keep out partizans of [a weaker] faction." Id.,
         at 249-250.<span class="sup">[64]</span>
         <p>Significantly, Madison's argument was not aimed at the imposition of a property
            qualification as such, but rather at the delegation to the Congress of the discretionary
            power to establish any qualifications. The parallel between Madison's arguments and
            those made in Wilkes' behalf is striking.<span class="sup">[65]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*535</span> In view of what followed Madison's speech, it
            appears that on this critical day the Framers were facing and then rejecting the
            possibility that the legislature would have power to usurp the "indisputable right [of
            the people] to return whom they thought proper"<span class="sup">[66]</span> to the
            legislature. Oliver Ellsworth, of Connecticut, noted that a legislative power to
            establish property qualifications was exceptional and "dangerous because it would be
            much more liable to abuse." Id., at 250. Gouverneur Morris then moved to strike "with
            regard to property" from the Committee's proposal. His intention was "to leave the
            Legislature entirely at large." Ibid. Hugh Williamson, of North Carolina, expressed
            concern that if a majority of the legislature should happen to be "composed of any
            particular description of men, of lawyers for example, . . . the future elections might
            be secured to their own body." Ibid.<span class="sup">[67]</span> Madison then referred
            to the British Parliament's assumption of the power to regulate the qualifications of
            both electors and the elected and noted that "the abuse they had made of it was a lesson
            worthy of our attention. They had made the changes in both cases subservient to their
            own views, or to the views of political or Religious parties." Ibid.<span class="sup"
               >[68]</span> Shortly thereafter, <span class="star-pagination">*536</span> the
            Convention rejected both Gouverneur Morris' motion and the Committee's proposal. Later
            the same day, the Convention adopted without debate the provision authorizing each House
            to be "the judge of the . . . qualifications of its own members." Id., at 254.</p>
         <p>One other decision made the same day is very important to determining the meaning of
            Art. I, &#x9e; 5. When the delegates reached the Committee of Detail's proposal to
            empower each House to expel its members, Madison "observed that the right of expulsion .
            . . was too important to be exercised by a bare majority of a quorum: and in emergencies
            [one] faction might be dangerously abused." Id., at 254. He therefore moved that "with
            the concurrence of two-thirds" be inserted. With the exception of one State, whose
            delegation was divided, the motion was unanimously approved without debate, although
            Gouverneur Morris noted his opposition. The importance of this decision cannot be
            over-emphasized. None of the parties to this suit disputes that prior to 1787 the
            legislative powers to judge qualifications and to expel were exercised by a majority
            vote. Indeed, without exception, the English and colonial antecedents to Art. I, &#x9e;
            5, cls. 1 and 2, support this conclusion. Thus, the Convention's decision to increase
            the vote required to expel, because that power was "too important to be exercised by a
            bare majority," while at the same time not similarly restricting the power to judge
            qualifications, is compelling evidence that they considered the latter already limited
            by the standing qualifications previously adopted.<span class="sup">[69]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*537</span> Respondents urge, however, that these events
            must be considered in light of what they regard as a very significant change made in
            Art. I, &#x9e; 2, cl. 2, by the Committee of Style. When the Committee of Detail
            reported the provision to the Convention, it read:</p> "Every member of the House of
         Representatives shall be of the age of twenty five years at least; shall have been a
         citizen of [in] the United States for at least three years before his election; and shall
         be, at the time of his election, a resident of the State in which he shall be chosen." Id.,
         at 178. <p>However, as finally drafted by the Committee of Style, these qualifications were
            stated in their present negative form. Respondents note that there are no records of the
            "deliberations" of the Committee of Style. Nevertheless, they speculate that this
            particular change was designed to make the provision correspond to the form used by
            Blackstone in listing the "standing incapacities" for membership in the House of
            Commons. See 1 W. Blackstone's Commentaries *175-176. Blackstone, who was an apologist
            for the anti-Wilkes forces in Parliament,<span class="sup">[70]</span>
            <span class="star-pagination">*538</span> had added to his Commentaries after Wilkes'
            exclusion the assertion that individuals who were not ineligible for the Commons under
            the standing incapacities could still be denied their seat if the Commons deemed them
            unfit for other reasons.<span class="sup">[71]</span> Since Blackstone's Commentaries
            was widely circulated in the Colonies, respondents further speculate that the Committee
            of Style rephrased the qualifications provision in the negative to clarify the
            delegates' intention "only to prescribe the standing incapacities without imposing any
            other limit on the historic power of each house to judge qualifications on a case by
            case basis."<span class="sup">[72]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Respondents' argument is inherently weak, however, because it assumes that legislative
            bodies historically possessed the power to judge qualifications on a case-by-case basis.
            As noted above, the basis for that conclusion was the Walpole and Wilkes cases, which,
            by the time of the Convention, had been denounced by the House of Commons and repudiated
            by at least one State government. Moreover, respondents' argument misrepresents the
            function of the Committee of Style. It was appointed only "to revise the stile of and
            arrange the articles which had been agreed to . . . ." 2 Farrand 553. <span
               class="star-pagination">*539</span> "[T]he Committee . . . had no authority from the
            Convention to make alterations of substance in the Constitution as voted by the
            Convention, nor did it purport to do so; and certainly the Convention had no belief . .
            . that any important change was, in fact, made in the provisions as to qualifications
            adopted by it on August 10."<span class="sup">[73]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Petitioners also argue that the post-Convention debates over the Constitution's
            ratification support their interpretation of &#x9e; 5. For example, they emphasize
            Hamilton's reply to the anti Federalist charge that the new Constitution favored the
            wealthy and well-born:</p>
         <p>"The truth is that there is no method of securing to the rich the preference apprehended
            but by prescribing qualifications of property either for those who may elect or be
            elected. But this forms no part of the power to be conferred upon the national
            government. Its authority would be expressly restricted to the regulation of the times,
            the places, the manner of elections. The qualifications of the persons who may choose or
            be chosen, as has been remarked upon other occasions, are defined and fixed in the
            Constitution, and are unalterable by the legislature." The <ref type="intent" num="52"
               >Federalist</ref> Papers 371 (Mentor ed. 1961). (Emphasis in last sentence added.) </p><p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*540</span> Madison had expressed similar views in an
            earlier essay,<span class="sup">[74]</span> and his arguments at the Convention leave no
            doubt about his agreement with Hamilton on this issue.</p>
         <p>Respondents counter that Hamilton was actually addressing himself to criticism of Art.
            I, &#x9e; 4, which authorizes Congress to regulate the times, places, and manner of
            electing members of Congress. They note that prominent anti Federalists had argued that
            this power could be used to "confer on the rich and well-born, all honours." Brutus No.
            IV, N. Y. Journal, Nov. 29, 1787, p. 7. (Emphasis in original.) Respondents' contention,
            however, ignores Hamilton's express reliance on the immutability of the qualifications
            set forth in the Constitution.<span class="sup">[75]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The debates at the state conventions also demonstrate the Framers' understanding that
            the qualifications for members of Congress had been fixed in the Constitution. Before
            the New York convention, for example, Hamilton emphasized: "[T]he true principle of a
            republic is, that <span class="star-pagination">*541</span> the people should choose
            whom they please to govern them. Representation is imperfect in proportion as the
            current of popular favor is checked. This great source of free government, popular
            election, should be perfectly pure, and the most unbounded liberty allowed." 2 Debates
            on the Federal Constitution 257 (J. Elliot ed. 1876) (hereinafter cited as Elliot's
               Debates).<span class="sup">[76]</span> In Virginia, where the Federalists faced
            powerful opposition by advocates of popular democracy, Wilson Carey Nicholas, a future
            member of both the House and Senate and later Governor of the State, met the arguments
            that the new Constitution violated democratic principles with the following
            interpretation of Art. I, &#x9e; 2, cl. 2, as it respects the qualifications of the
            elected: "It has ever been considered a great security to liberty, that very few should
            be excluded from the right of being chosen to the legislature. This Constitution has
            amply attended to this idea. We find no qualifications required except those of age and
            residence, which create a certainty of their judgment being matured, and of being
            attached to their state." 3 Elliot's Debates 8.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>c. Post-Ratification.</h2>
         <p>As clear as these statements appear, respondents dismiss them as "general statements . .
            . directed to other issues."<span class="sup">[77]</span> They suggest that far more
            relevant is Congress' own understanding of its power to judge qualifications as
            manifested in post-ratification exclusion cases. Unquestionably, both the House and the
            Senate have excluded members-elect for reasons other than their <span
               class="star-pagination">*542</span> failure to meet the Constitution's standing
            qualifications. For almost the first 100 years of its existence, however, Congress
            strictly limited its power to judge the qualifications of its members to those
            enumerated in the Constitution.</p>
         <p>Congress was first confronted with the issue in 1807,<span class="sup">[78]</span> when
            the eligibility of William McCreery was challenged because he did not meet additional
            residency requirements imposed by the State of Maryland. In recommending that he be
            seated, the House Committee of Elections reasoned:</p> "The committee proceeded to
         examine the Constitution, with relation to the case submitted to them, and find that
         qualifications of members are therein determined, without reserving any authority to the
         State Legislatures to change, add to, or diminish those qualifications; and that, by that
         instrument, Congress is constituted the sole judge of the qualifications prescribed by it,
         and are obliged to decide agreeably to the Constitutional rules . . . ." 17 Annals of Cong.
         871 (1807). <p>Lest there be any misunderstanding of the basis for the committee's
            recommendation, during the ensuing debate the chairman explained the principles by which
            the committee was governed:</p> "The Committee of Elections considered the
         qualifications of members to have been unalterably determined <span class="star-pagination"
            >*543</span> by the Federal Convention, unless changed by an authority equal to that
         which framed the Constitution at first; that neither the State nor the Federal Legislatures
         are vested with authority to add to those qualifications, so as to change them. . . .
         Congress, by the Federal Constitution, are not authorized to prescribe the qualifications
         of their own members, but they are authorized to judge of their qualifications; in doing
         so, however, they must be governed by the rules prescribed by the Federal Constitution, and
         by them only. These are the principles on which the Election Committee have made up their
         report, and upon which their resolution is founded." Id., at 872. <p>The chairman
            emphasized that the committee's narrow construction of the power of the House to judge
            qualifications was compelled by the "fundamental principle in a free government," id.,
            at 873, that restrictions upon the people to choose their own representatives must be
            limited to those "absolutely necessary for the safety of the society." Id., at 874. At
            the conclusion of a lengthy debate, which tended to center on the more narrow issue of
            the power of the States to add to the standing qualifications set forth in the
            Constitution, the House agreed by a vote of 89 to 18 to seat Congressman McCreery. Id.,
            at 1237. See 1 A. Hinds, Precedents of the House of Representatives of the United States
            &#x9e; 414 (1907) (hereinafter cited as Hinds).</p>
         <p>There was no significant challenge to these principles for the next several
               decades.<span class="sup">[79]</span> They came under heavy <span
               class="star-pagination">*544</span> attack, however, "during the stress of civil war
            [but initially] the House of Representatives declined to exercise the power [to
            exclude], even under circumstances of great provocation."<span class="sup">[80]</span>

            12, p. 7 (1967). The abandonment of such restraint, however, was among the casualties of
            the general upheaval produced in war's wake. In 1868, the House voted for the first time
            in its history to exclude a member-elect. It refused to seat two duly elected
            representatives for giving aid and comfort to the Confederacy. See 1 Hinds &#x9e;&#x9e;
               449-451.<span class="sup">[81]</span> "This change was produced by the North's bitter
            enmity toward those who failed to support the Union cause during the war, and was
            effected by the Radical Republican domination of Congress. It was a shift brought about
            by the naked urgency of power and was given little doctrinal support." Comment,

               class="star-pagination">*545</span> the present, congressional practice has been
               erratic;<span class="sup">[83]</span> and on the few occasions when a member-elect
            was excluded although he met all the qualifications set forth in the <span
               class="star-pagination">*546</span> Constitution, there were frequently vigorous
               dissents.<span class="sup">[84]</span> Even the annotations to the official manual of
            procedure for the 90th Congress manifest doubt as to the House's power to exclude a
            member-elect who has met the constitutionally prescribed qualifications. See Rules of
            the House of Representatives, H. R. Doc. No. 529, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., &#x9e; 12, pp.
            7-8 (1967).</p>
         <p>Had these congressional exclusion precedents been more consistent, their precedential
            value still would be quite limited. See Note, The Power of a House of Congress to Judge
            the Qualifications of its Members, 81 Harv. L. Rev. 673, 679 (1968).<span class="sup"
               >[85]</span> That an unconstitutional <span class="star-pagination">*547</span>
            action has been taken before surely does not render that same action any less
            unconstitutional at a later date. Particularly in view of the Congress' own doubts in
            those few cases where it did exclude members-elect, we are not inclined to give its
            precedents controlling weight. The relevancy of prior exclusion cases is limited largely
            to the insight they afford in correctly ascertaining the draftsmen's intent. Obviously,
            therefore, the precedential value of these cases tends to increase in proportion to
            their proximity to the Convention in 1787. See Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 175
            (1926). And, what evidence we have of Congress' early understanding confirms our
            conclusion that the House is without power to exclude any member-elect who meets the
            Constitution's requirements for membership.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>d. Conclusion.</h2>
         <p>Had the intent of the Framers emerged from these materials with less clarity, we would
            nevertheless have been compelled to resolve any ambiguity in favor of a narrow
            construction of the scope of Congress' power to exclude members-elect. A fundamental
            principle of our representative democracy is, in Hamilton's words, "that the people
            should choose whom they please to govern them." 2 Elliot's Debates 257. As Madison
            pointed out at the Convention, this principle is undermined as much by limiting whom the
            people can select as by limiting the franchise itself. In apparent agreement with this
            basic philosophy, the Convention adopted his suggestion limiting the power to expel. To
            allow essentially that same power to be exercised under the guise of judging
            qualifications, would be to ignore Madison's warning, borne out in the Wilkes case and
            some of Congress' <span class="star-pagination">*548</span> own post-Civil War exclusion
            cases, against "vesting an improper &amp;amp; dangerous power in the Legislature." 2
            Farrand 249. Moreover, it would effectively nullify the Convention's decision to require
            a two-thirds vote for expulsion. Unquestionably, Congress has an interest in preserving
            its institutional integrity, but in most cases that interest can be sufficiently
            safeguarded by the exercise of its power to punish its members for disorderly behavior
            and, in extreme cases, to expel a member with the concurrence of two-thirds. In short,
            both the intention of the Framers, to the extent it can be determined, and an
            examination of the basic principles of our democratic system persuade us that the
            Constitution does not vest in the Congress a discretionary power to deny membership by a
            majority vote.</p>
         <p>For these reasons, we have concluded that Art. I, &#x9e; 5, is at most a "textually
            demonstrable commitment" to Congress to judge only the qualifications expressly set
            forth in the Constitution. Therefore, the "textual commitment" formulation of the
            political question doctrine does not bar federal courts from adjudicating petitioners'
            claims.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>2. Other Considerations.</h2>
         <p>Respondents' alternate contention is that the case presents a political question because
            judicial resolution of petitioners' claim would produce a "potentially embarrassing
            confrontation between coordinate branches" of the Federal Government. But, as our
            interpretation of Art. I, &#x9e; 5, discloses, a determination of petitioner Powell's
            right to sit would require no more than an interpretation of the Constitution. Such a
            determination falls within the traditional role accorded courts to interpret the law,
            and does not involve a "lack of the respect due [a] co-ordinate [branch] of government,"
            nor does it involve an "initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non-judicial
               <span class="star-pagination">*549</span> discretion." Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186,
            at 217. Our system of government requires that federal courts on occasion interpret the
            Constitution in a manner at variance with the construction given the document by another
            branch. The alleged conflict that such an adjudication may cause cannot justify the
            courts' avoiding their constitutional responsibility.<span class="sup">[86]</span> See
            United States v. Brown, 381 U. S. 437, 462 (1965); Youngstown Sheet &amp;amp; Tube Co.
            v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 613-614 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); Myers v. United
            States, 272 U. S. 52, 293 (1926) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).</p>
         <p>Nor are any of the other formulations of a political question "inextricable from the
            case at bar." Baker v. Carr, supra, at 217. Petitioners seek a determination that the
            House was without power to exclude Powell from the 90th Congress, which, we have seen,
            requires an interpretation of the ConstitutionÔÇöa determination for which clearly there
            are "judicially . . . manageable standards." Finally, a judicial resolution of
            petitioners' claim will not result in "multifarious pronouncements by various
            departments on one question." For, as we noted in Baker v. Carr, supra, at 211, it is
            the responsibility of this Court to act as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution.
            Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803). Thus, we conclude that petitioners' claim is
            not barred by the political question doctrine, and, having determined that the claim is
            otherwise generally justiciable, we hold that the case is justiciable.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>VII.</h2>
         <p/>
         <h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>
         <p>To summarize, we have determined the following: (1) This case has not been mooted by
            Powell's seating in <span class="star-pagination">*550</span> the 91st Congress. (2)
            Although this action should be dismissed against respondent Congressmen, it may be
            sustained against their agents. (3) The 90th Congress' denial of membership to Powell
            cannot be treated as an expulsion. (4) We have jurisdiction over the subject matter of
            this controversy. (5) The case is justiciable.</p>
         <p>Further, analysis of the "textual commitment" under Art. I, &#x9e; 5 (see Part VI, B
            (1)), has demonstrated that in judging the qualifications of its members Congress is
            limited to the standing qualifications prescribed in the Constitution. Respondents
            concede that Powell met these. Thus, there is no need to remand this case to determine
            whether he was entitled to be seated in the 90th Congress. Therefore, we hold that,
            since Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., was duly elected by the voters of the 18th Congressional
            District of New York and was not ineligible to serve under any provision of the
            Constitution, the House was without power to exclude him from its membership.</p>
         <p>Petitioners seek additional forms of equitable relief, including mandamus for the
            release of petitioner Powell's back pay. The propriety of such remedies, however, is
            more appropriately considered in the first instance by the courts below. Therefore, as
            to respondents McCormack, Albert, Ford, Celler, and Moore, the judgment of the Court of
            Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is affirmed. As to respondents Jennings,
            Johnson, and Miller, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
            Circuit is reversed and the case is remanded to the United States District Court for the
            District of Columbia with instructions to enter a declaratory judgment and for further
            proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
         <p>It is so ordered.</p></div>
      <div type="concurrence" judge="douglas">
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*551</span> MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS.</p>
         <p>While I join the opinion of the Court, I add a few words. As the Court says, the
            important constitutional question is whether the Congress has the power to deviate from
            or alter the qualifications for membership as a Representative contained in Art. I,
            &#x9e; 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution.<span class="sup">[1]</span> Up to now the
            understanding has been quite clear to the effect that such authority does not
               exist.<span class="sup">[2]</span> To be sure, Art. I, &#x9e; 5, provides that: "Each
               <span class="star-pagination">*552</span> House shall be the Judge of the Elections,
            Returns and Qualifications of its own Members . . . ." Contests may arise over whether
            an elected official meets the "qualifications" of the Constitution, in which event the
            House is the sole judge.<span class="sup">[3]</span> But the House is not the sole judge
            when "qualifications" are added which are not specified in the Constitution.<span
               class="sup">[4]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*553</span> A man is not seated because he is a Socialist
            or a Communist.<span class="sup">[5]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Another is not seated because in his district members of a minority are systematically
            excluded from voting.<span class="sup">[6]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Another is not seated because he has spoken out in opposition to the war in
               Vietnam.<span class="sup">[7]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The possible list is long. Some cases will have the racist overtones of the present
            one.</p>
         <p>Others may reflect religious or ideological clashes.<span class="sup">[8]</span>
         </p>
         <p>At the root of all these cases, however, is the basic integrity of the electoral
            process. Today we proclaim the constitutional principle of "one man, one vote." When
            that principle is followed and the electors choose a person who is repulsive to the
            Establishment in Congress, by what constitutional authority can that group of electors
            be disenfranchised?</p>
         <p>By Art. I, &#x9e; 5, the House may "expel a Member" by a vote of two-thirds. And if this
            were an expulsion case I would think that no justiciable controversy would be presented,
            the vote of the House being two-thirds or more. But it is not an expulsion case. Whether
            it could have been won as an expulsion case, no one knows. Expulsion for "misconduct"
            may well raise different questions, different considerations. Policing the conduct of
            members, a recurring problem in the Senate and House as well, is quite different from
            the initial decision whether an elected official should be seated. It well might be
            easier to bar admission than to expel one already seated.</p>
         <p>The House excluded Representative-elect Powell from the 90th Congress allegedly for
            misappropriating public funds and for incurring the contempt of New York <span
               class="star-pagination">*554</span> courts.<span class="sup">[9]</span> Twenty-six
            years earlier, members of the upper chamber attempted to exclude Senator-elect William
            Langer of North Dakota for like reasons.<span class="sup">[10]</span> Langer first
            became State's Attorney for Morton County, North Dakota, from 1914 to 1916, and then
            served as State Attorney General from 1916 to 1920. He became Governor of the State in
            1932 and took office in January 1933. In 1934 he was indicted for conspiring to
            interfere with the enforcement of federal law by illegally soliciting political
            contributions from federal employees, and suit was filed in the State Supreme Court to
            remove him from office.<span class="sup">[11]</span> While that suit was pending, he
            called the State Legislature into special session.<span class="sup">[12]</span> When it
            became clear that the court would order his ouster, he signed a Declaration of
            Independence, invoked martial law, and called out the National Guard.<span class="sup"
               >[13]</span> Nonetheless, when his own officers refused to recognize him as the legal
            head of state, he left office in July 1934. As with Adam Clayton Powell, however, the
            people of the State still wanted him. In 1937 they re-elected him Governor and, in 1940,
            they sent him to the United States Senate.</p>
         <p>During the swearing-in ceremonies, Senator Barkley drew attention to certain complaints
            filed against Langer by citizens of North Dakota, yet asked that he be allowed to take
            the oath of office</p> "without prejudice, which is a two-sided proposition ÔÇöwithout
         prejudice to the Senator and without <span class="star-pagination">*555</span> prejudice to
         the Senate in the exercise of its right [to exclude him]."<span class="sup">[14]</span>
         <p>The matter of Langer's qualifications to serve in the Senate was referred to committee
            which held confidential hearings on January 9 and 16, 1941, and open hearings on
            November 3 and 18, 1941. By a vote of 14 to 2, the committee reported that a majority of
            the Senate had jurisdiction under Art. I, &#x9e; 5, cl. 1, of the Constitution to
            exclude Langer; and, by a vote of 13 to 3, it reported its recommendation that Langer
            not be seated.<span class="sup">[15]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The charges against Langer were various. As with Powell, they included claims that he
            had misappropriated public funds<span class="sup">[16]</span> and that he had interfered
            with the judicial process in a way that beclouded the dignity of Congress.<span
               class="sup">[17]</span> Reference was also made to his professional ethics as a
               lawyer.<span class="sup">[18]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Langer enjoyed the powerful advocacy of Senator Murdock from Utah. The Senate debate
            itself raged <span class="star-pagination">*556</span> for over a year.<span class="sup"
               >[19]</span> Much of it related to purely factual allegations of "moral turpitude."
            Some of it, however, was addressed to the power of the Senate under Art. I, &#x9e; 5,
            cl. 1, to exclude a member-elect for lacking qualifications not enumerated in Art. I,
            &#x9e; 3.</p> "Mr. MURDOCK. . . . [U]nder the Senator's theory that the Senate has the
         right to add qualifications which are not specified in the Constitution, does the Senator
         believe the Senate could adopt a rule specifying intellectual and moral
            qualifications?<span class="sup">[20]</span> "Mr. LUCAS. The Senate can do anything it
         wants to do . . . . Yes; the Senate can deny a person his seat simply because it does not
         like the cut of his jaw, if it wishes to."<span class="sup">[21]</span>
         <p>Senator Murdock argued that the only qualifications for service in the Senate were those
            enumerated in the Constitution; that Congress had the power to review those enumerated
            qualifications; but that it could notÔÇö while purporting to "judge" those
            qualificationsÔÇöin reality add to them.</p> "Mr. LUCAS. The Senator referred to article
         I, section 5. What does he think the framers of the Constitution meant when they gave to
         each House the power to determine or to judge the qualifications, and so forth, of its own
            Members?<span class="sup">[22]</span> "Mr. MURDOCK. I construe the term `judge' to mean
         what it is held to mean in its common, ordinary usage. My understanding of the definition
         of the <span class="star-pagination">*557</span> word `judge' as a verb is this: When we
         judge of a thing it is supposed that the rules are laid out; the law is there for us to
         look at and to apply to the facts. "But whoever heard the word `judge' used as meaning the
         power to add to what already is the law?"<span class="sup">[23]</span>
         <p>It was also suggested from the floor that the enumerated qualifications in &#x9e; 3 were
            only a minimum which the Senate could supplement; and that the Founding Fathers so
            intended by using words of the negative. To which Senator Murdock repliedÔÇö</p> "Mr.
         President, I think it is the very distinguished and able Senator from Georgia who makes the
         contention that the constitutional provisions relating to qualifications, because they are
         stated in the negativeÔÇöthat is, `no person shall be a Senator'ÔÇöare merely restrictions
         or prohibitions on the State; butÔÇöand I shall read it later onÔÇöwhen we read what
         Madison said, when we read what Hamilton said, when we read what the other framers of the
         Constitution said on that question, there cannot be a doubt as to what they intended and
         what they meant.<span class="sup">[24]</span> ..... "Madison knew that the qualifications
         should be contained in the Constitution and not left to the whim and caprice of the
            legislature.<span class="sup">[25]</span> ..... "Bear that in mind, that the positive or
         affirmative phraseology was not changed to the negative by debate or by amendment in the
         convention, but it <span class="star-pagination">*558</span> was changed by the committee
         of which Madison was a member, the committee on style."<span class="sup">[26]</span>
         <p>The Senate was nonetheless troubled by the suggestion that the Constitution compelled it
            to accept anyone whom the people might elect, no matter how egregious and even criminal
            his behavior. No need to worry, said Murdock. It is true that the Senate cannot invoke
            its majority power to "judge" under Art. I, &#x9e; 5, cl. 1, as a device for excluding
            men elected by the people who possess the qualifications enumerated by the Constitution.
            But it does have the power under Art. I, &#x9e; 5, cl. 2, to expel anyone it designates
            by a two-thirds vote. Nonetheless, he urged the Senate not to bypass the two-thirds
            requirement for expulsion by wrongfully invoking its power to exclude.<span class="sup"
               >[27]</span>
         </p> "Mr. LUCAS. . . . The position the Senator from Utah takes is that it does not make
         any difference what a Senator does in the way of crime, that whenever he is elected by the
         people of his State, comes here with bona fide credentials, and there is no fraud in the
         election, the Senate cannot refuse to give him the oath. That is the position the Senator
         takes? "MR. MURDOCK. That is my position; yes.<span class="sup">[28]</span> ..... "My
         position is that we do not have the right to exclude anyone who comes here clothed with the
         proper credentials and possessing the constitutional qualifications. My position is that we
         do not have <span class="star-pagination">*559</span> the right under the provision of the
         Constitution to which the Senator from Florida referred, to add to the qualifications. My
         position is that the State is the sole judge of the intellectual and the moral
         qualifications of the representatives it sends to Congress."<span class="sup">[29]</span>
         "MR. MURDOCK [quoting Senator Philander Knox]. `I know of no defect in the plain rule of
         the Constitution for which I am contending. . . . I cannot see that any danger to the
         Senate lies in the fact that an improper character cannot be excluded without a two-thirds
         vote. It requires the unanimous vote of a jury to convict a man accused of crime; it should
         require, and I believe that it does require, a two-thirds vote to eject a Senator from his
         position of honor and power, to which he has been elected by a sovereign State.' "<span
            class="sup">[30]</span>
         <p>Thus, after a year of debate, on March 27, 1942, the Senate overruled the recommendation
            of its committee and voted 52 to 30 to seat Langer.</p>

      <div type="dissent" judge="stewart"><p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART, dissenting.</p>
         <p>I believe that events which have taken place since certiorari was granted in this case
            on November 18, 1968, have rendered it moot, and that the Court should therefore refrain
            from deciding the novel, difficult, and delicate constitutional questions which the case
            presented at its inception.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>
            <span class="star-pagination">*560</span> I.</h2>
         <p>The essential purpose of this lawsuit by Congressman Powell and members of his
            constituency was to regain the seat from which he was barred by the 90th Congress. That
            purpose, however, became impossible of attainment on January 3, 1969, when the 90th
            Congress passed into history and the 91st Congress came into being. On that date, the
            petitioners' prayer for a judicial decree restraining enforcement of House Resolution
            No. 278 and commanding the respondents to admit Congressman Powell to membership in the
            90th Congress became incontestably moot.</p>
         <p>The petitioners assert that actions of the House of Representatives of the 91st Congress
            have prolonged the controversy raised by Powell's exclusion and preserved the need for a
            judicial declaration in this case. I believe, to the contrary, that the conduct of the
            present House of Representatives confirms the mootness of the petitioners' suit against
            the 90th Congress. Had Powell been excluded from the 91st Congress, he might argue that
            there was a "continuing controversy" concerning the exclusion attacked in this
               case.<span class="sup">[1]</span> And such an argument might be sound even though the
            present House of Representatives is a distinct legislative body rather than a
            continuation of its predecessor,<span class="sup">[2]</span> and though any grievance
               <span class="star-pagination">*561</span> caused by conduct of the 91st Congress is
            not redressable in this action. But on January 3, 1969, the House of Representatives of
            the 91st Congress admitted Congressman Powell to membership, and he now sits as the
            Representative of the 18th Congressional District of New York. With the 90th Congress
            terminated and Powell now a member of the 91st, it cannot seriously be contended that
            there remains a judicial controversy between these parties over the power of the House
            of Representatives to exclude Powell and the power of a court to order him reseated.
            Understandably, neither the Court nor the petitioners advance the wholly untenable
            proposition that the continuation of this case can be founded on the infinitely remote
            possibility that Congressman Powell, or any other Representative, may someday be
            excluded for the same reasons or in the same manner. And because no foreseeable
            possibility of such future conduct exists, the respondents have met their heavy burden
            of showing that "subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful
            behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur." United States v. Concentrated
            Phosphate Export Assn., 393 U. S. 199, 203.<span class="sup">[3]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The petitioners further argue that this case cannot be deemed moot because of the
            principle that "the voluntary abandonment of a practice does not relieve a court of
            adjudicating its legality . . . ." Gray v. Sanders, 372 <span class="star-pagination"

            however, that this principle and the cases enunciating it have no application to the
            present case. In the first place, this case does not involve "the voluntary abandonment
            of a practice." Rather it became moot because of an event over which the respondents had
            no controlÔÇöthe expiration of the 90th Congress. Moreover, unlike the cases relied on
            by the petitioners, there has here been no ongoing course of conduct of indefinite
            duration against which a permanent injunction is necessary. Thus, it cannot be said of
            the respondents' actions in this case, as it was of the conduct sought to be enjoined in
            Gray, for example, that "the practice is deeply rooted and long standing," ibid., or
            that, without judicial relief, the respondents would be "free to return to [their] old
            ways." United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 632.<span class="sup">[5]</span>
            Finally, and <span class="star-pagination">*563</span> most important, the "voluntary
            abandonment" rule does not dispense with the requirement of a continuing controversy,
            nor could it under the definition of the judicial power in Article III of the
            Constitution. Voluntary cessation of unlawful conduct does make a case moot "if the
            defendant can demonstrate that `there is no reasonable expectation that the wrong will
            be repeated.' " Id., at 633.<span class="sup">[6]</span> Since that is the situation
            here, the case would be moot even if it could be said that it became so by the House's
            "voluntary abandonment" of its "practice" of excluding Congressman Powell.</p>
         <p>The petitioners' proposition that conduct of the 91st Congress has perpetuated the
            controversy is based on the fact that House Resolution No. 2ÔÇöthe same resolution by
            which the House voted to seat PowellÔÇöfined him $25,000 and provided that his seniority
            was to commence as of the date he became a member of the 91st Congress.<span class="sup"
               >[7]</span> That punishment, it is said, "arises out of the <span
               class="star-pagination">*564</span> prior actions of the House which originally
            impelled this action." It is indisputable, however, that punishment of a House member
            involves constitutional issues entirely distinct from those raised by exclusion,<span
               class="sup">[8]</span> and that a punishment in one Congress is in no legal sense a
            "continuation" of an exclusion from the previous Congress. A judicial determination that
            the exclusion was improper would have no bearing on the constitutionality of the
            punishment, nor any conceivable practical impact on Powell's status in the 91st
            Congress. It is thus clear that the only connection between the exclusion by the 90th
            Congress and the punishment by the 91st is that they were evidently based on the same
            asserted derelictions of Congressman Powell. But this action was not brought to
            exonerate Powell or to expunge the legislative findings of his wrongdoing; its only
            purpose was to restrain the action taken in consequence of those findingsÔÇö Powell's
            exclusion.</p>
         <p>Equally without substance is the petitioners' contention that this case is saved from
            mootness by application of the asserted "principle" that a case challenging allegedly
            unconstitutional conduct cannot be rendered moot <span class="star-pagination"
               >*565</span> by further unconstitutional conduct of the defendants. Under this
            hypothesis, it is said that the "Court can not determine that the conduct of the House
            on January 3, 1969, has mooted this controversy without inferentially, at least, holding
            that the action of the House of that day was legal and constitutionally permissible." If
            there is in our jurisprudence any doctrine remotely resembling the petitioners'
            theoryÔÇöwhich they offer without reference to any authorityÔÇöit has no conceivable
            relevance to this case. For the events of January 3, 1969, that made this case moot were
            the termination of the 90th Congress and Powell's seating in the 91st, not the
            punishment which the petitioners allege to have been unconstitutional. That punishment
            is wholly irrelevant to the question of mootness and is in no wise before the Court in
            this case.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II.</h2>
         <p>The passage of time and intervening events have, therefore, made it impossible to afford
            the petitioners the principal relief they sought in this case. If any aspect of the case
            remains alive, it is only Congressman Powell's individual claim for the salary of which
            he was deprived by his absence from the 90th Congress.<span class="sup">[9]</span> But
            even if that claim can be said to prevent this controversy from being moot, which I
            doubt, there is no need to reach the fundamental constitutional issues that the Court
            today undertakes to decide.</p>
         <p>This Court has not in the past found that an incidental claim for back pay preserves the
            controversy between a legislator and the legislative body which evicted him, once the
            term of his eviction has expired. Alejandrino v. Quezon, 271 U. S. 528, was a case
            nearly identical to <span class="star-pagination">*566</span> that before the Court
            today. The petitioner was a member of the Senate of the Philippines who had been
            suspended for one year for assaulting a colleague. He brought an action in the Supreme
            Court of the Philippines against the elected members of the Senate<span class="sup"
               >[10]</span> and its officers and employees (the President, Secretary, Sergeant at
            Arms, and Paymaster), seeking a writ of mandamus and an injunction restoring him to his
            seat and to all the privileges and emoluments of office. The Supreme Court of the
            Philippines dismissed the action for want of jurisdiction and Alejandrino brought the
            case here,<span class="sup">[11]</span> arguing that the suspension was not authorized
            by the Philippine Autonomy Act, a statute which incorporated most of the provisions of
            Article I of the United States Constitution.<span class="sup">[12]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*567</span> Because the period of the suspension had
            expired while the case was pending on certiorari, a unanimous Court, in an opinion by
            Chief Justice Taft, vacated the judgment and remanded the case with directions to
            dismiss it as moot. To Alejandrino's claim that his right to back pay kept the case
            alive, the Court gave the following answer, which, because of its particular pertinency
            to this case, I quote at length:</p> "It may be suggested, as an objection to our
         vacating the action of the court below, and directing the dismissal of the petition as
         having become a moot case, that, while the lapse of time has made unnecessary and futile a
         writ of mandamus to restore Senator Alejandrino to the Island Senate, there still remains a
         right on his part to the recovery of his emoluments, which were withheld during his
         suspension, and that we ought to retain the case for the purpose of determining whether he
         may not have a mandamus for this purpose. . . . It is difficult for the Court to deal with
         this feature of the case, which is really only a mere incident to the main question made in
         the petition and considered in the able and extended brief of counsel for the petitioner,
         and the only brief before us. That brief is not in any part of it directed to the subject
         of emoluments, nor does it refer us to any statute or to the rules of the Senate by which
         the method of paying Senators' salaries is provided, or in a definite way describe the
         duties of the officer or officers or committee charged with the ministerial function of
         paying them. ..... ". . . the remedy of the Senator would seem to be by mandamus to compel
         such official in the discharge of his ministerial duty to pay him the salary due, and the
         presence of the Senate as a party would be <span class="star-pagination">*568</span>
         unnecessary. Should that official rely upon the resolution of the Senate as a reason for
         refusing to comply with his duty to pay Senators, the validity of such a defense and the
         validity of the resolution might become a judicial question affecting the personal right of
         the complaining Senator, properly to be disposed of in such action, but not requiring the
         presence of the Senate as a party for its adjudication. The right of the petitioner to his
         salary does not therefore involve the very serious issue raised in this petition as to the
         power of the Philippine Supreme Court to compel by mandamus one of the two legislative
         bodies constituting the legislative branch of the Government to rescind a resolution
         adopted by it in asserted lawful discipline of one of its members, for disorder and breach
         of privilege. We think, now that the main question as to the validity of the suspension has
         become moot, the incidental issue as to the remedy which the suspended Senator may have in
         recovery of his emoluments, if illegally withheld, should properly be tried in a separate
         proceeding against an executive officer or officers as described. As we are not able to
         derive from the petition sufficient information upon which properly to afford such a
         remedy, we must treat the whole cause as moot and act accordingly. This action on our part
         of course is without prejudice to a suit by Senator Alejandrino against the proper
         executive officer or committee by way of mandamus or otherwise to obtain payment of the
         salary which may have been unlawfully withheld from him." 271 U. S., at 533, 534-535.<span
            class="sup">[13]</span>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*569</span> Both of the factors on which the Court relied
            in Alejandrino are present in this case. Indeed, the salary claim is an even more
            incidental and subordinate aspect of this case than it was of Alejandrino.<span
               class="sup">[14]</span> And the availability of effective relief for that claim
            against any of the present respondents is far from certain. As in Alejandrino, the
            briefs and memoranda submitted by the parties in this case contain virtually no
            discussion of this question ÔÇöthe only question of remedy remaining in the case. It
            appears from relevant provisions of law, however, that the Sergeant at Arms of the
            HouseÔÇöan official newly <span class="star-pagination">*570</span> elected by each
               Congress<span class="sup">[15]</span>ÔÇöis responsible for the retention and
            disbursement to Congressmen of the funds appropriated for their salaries. These funds
            are payable from the United States Treasury<span class="sup">[16]</span> upon
            requisitions presented by the Sergeant at Arms, who is entrusted with keeping the books
            and accounts "for the compensation and mileage of Members,"<span class="sup">[17]</span>
            A Congressman who has presented his credentials and taken the oath of office<span
               class="sup">[18]</span> is entitled to be paid monthly on the basis of certificates
            of the Clerk<span class="sup">[19]</span> and Speaker of the House.<span class="sup"
               >[20]</span> Powell's prayer for a mandamus and an injunction against the Sergeant at
            Arms is presumably based on this statutory scheme.</p>
         <p>Several important questions remain unanswered, however, on this record. Is the Sergeant
            at Arms the only necessary defendant? If so, the case is surely moot as to the other
            respondents, including the House members, and they should be dismissed as parties on
            that ground rather than after resolution of difficult constitutional questions under the
            Speech or Debate Clause. But it is far from clear that Powell has an appropriate or
            adequate remedy against the remaining respondents. For if the Speaker does not issue the
            requisite certificates and the House does not rescind Resolution No. 278, can the House
            agents be enjoined to act in direct contravention of the orders of their employers?
            Moreover, the office of Sergeant at Arms of the 90th Congress has now expired, and the
            present Sergeant at Arms serves the 91st Congress. If he were made a party in that
            capacity, would he have the authorityÔÇöor could the 91st Congress <span
               class="star-pagination">*571</span> confer the authorityÔÇöto disburse money for a
            salary owed to a Representative in the previous Congress, particularly one who never
            took the oath of office? Presumably funds have not been appropriated to the 91st
            Congress or requisitioned by its Sergeant at Arms for the payment of salaries to members
            of prior Congresses. Nor is it ascertainable from this record whether money appropriated
            for Powell's salary by the 90th Congress, if any, remains at the disposal of the current
            House and its Sergeant at Arms.<span class="sup">[21]</span>
         </p>
         <p>There are, then substantial questions as to whether, on his salary claim, Powell could
            obtain relief against any or all of these respondents. On the other hand, if he was
            entitled to a salary as a member of the 90th Congress, he has a certain and completely
            satisfactory remedy in an action for a money judgment against the United States in the
            Court of Claims.<span class="sup">[22]</span> While that court could not have ordered
            Powell seated or entered a declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of his
               exclusion,<span class="sup">[23]</span> it <span class="star-pagination">*572</span>
            is not disputed that the Court of Claims could grant him a money judgment for lost
            salary on the ground that his discharge from the House violated the Constitution. I
            would remit Congressman Powell to that remedy, and not simply because of the serious
            doubts about the availability of the one he now pursues. Even if the mandatory relief
            sought by Powell is appropriate and could be effective, the Court should insist that the
            salary claim be litigated in a context that would clearly obviate the need to decide
            some of the constitutional questions with which the Court grapples today, and might
            avoid them altogether.<span class="sup">[24]</span> In an action in the Court of Claims
            for a money judgment against the United States, there would be no question concerning
            the impact of the Speech or Debate Clause on a suit against members of the House of
            Representatives and their agents, and questions of jurisdiction and justiciability
            would, if raised at all, be in a vastly different and more conventional form.</p>
         <p>In short, dismissal of Powell's action against the legislative branch would not in the
            slightest prejudice his money claim,<span class="sup">[25]</span> and it would avoid the
            necessity of deciding <span class="star-pagination">*573</span> constitutional issues
            which, in the petitioners' words, "touch the bedrock of our political system [and]
            strike at the very heart of representative government." If the fundamental principles
            restraining courts from unnecessarily or prematurely reaching out to decide grave and
            perhaps unsettling constitutional questions retain any vitality, see Ashwander v. TVA,
            297 U. S. 288, 346-348 (Brandeis, J., concurring), surely there have been few cases more
            demanding of their application than this one. And those principles are entitled to
            special respect in suits, like this suit, for declaratory and injunctive relief, which
            it is within a court's broad discretion to withhold. "We have cautioned against
            declaratory judgments on issues of public moment, even falling short of
            constitutionality, in speculative situations." Public Affairs Press v. Rickover, 369 U.
            S. 111, 112. "Especially where governmental action is involved, courts should not
            intervene unless the need for equitable relief is clear, not remote or speculative."
            Eccles v. Peoples Bank of Lakewood Village, 333 U. S. 426, 431.</p>
         <p>If this lawsuit is to be prolonged, I would at the very least not reach the merits
            without ascertaining that a decision can lead to some effective relief. The Court's
            remand for determination of that question implicitly recognizes that there may be no
            remaining controversy between petitioner Powell and any of these respondents redressable
            by a court, and that its opinion today may be wholly advisory. But I see no good reason
            for any court even to pass on the question of the availability <span
               class="star-pagination">*574</span> of relief against any of these respondents.
            Because the essential purpose of the action against them is no longer attainable and
            Powell has a fully adequate and far more appropriate remedy for his incidental back-pay
            claim, I would withhold the discretionary relief prayed for and terminate this lawsuit
            now. Powell's claim for salary may not be dead, but this case against all these
            respondents is truly moot. Accordingly, I would vacate the judgment below and remand the
            case with directions to dismiss the complaint.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="notes">
         <p>[1] Powell requested that he be given (1) notice of the charges pending against him,
            including a bill of particulars as to any accuser; (2) the opportunity to confront any
            accuser, to attend all committee sessions where evidence was given, and the right to
            cross-examine all witnesses; (3) public hearings; (4) the right to have the Select
            Committee issue its process to summon witnesses for his defense; (5) and a transcript of
            every hearing. Hearings on H. R. Res. No. 1 before Select Committee Pursuant to H. R.
            Res. No. 1, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 54 (1967). </p>
         <p>The Select Committee noted that it had given Powell notice of the matters it would
            inquire into, that Powell had the right to attend all hearings (which would be public)
            with his counsel, and that the Committee would call witnesses upon Powell's written
            request and supply a transcript of the hearings. Id., at 59.</p>
         <p>[2] The complaint also attacked the House Resolution as a bill of attainder, an ex post
            facto law, and as cruel and unusual punishment. Further, petitioners charged that the
            hearing procedures adopted by the Select Committee violated the Due Process Clause of
            the Fifth Amendment.</p>
         <p>[3] The District Court refused to convene a three-judge court and the Court of Appeals
            affirmed. Petitioners did not press this issue in their petition for writ of certiorari,
            apparently recognizing the validity of the Court of Appeals' ruling. See Stamler v.
            Willis, 393 U. S. 217 (1968).</p>
         <p>[4] Petitioners also requested that a writ of mandamus issue ordering that the named
            officials perform the same acts.</p>
         <p>[5] The District Court entered its order April 7, 1967, and a notice of appeal was filed
            the same day. On April 11, 1967, Powell was re-elected to the House of Representatives
            in a special election called to fill his seat. The formal certification of election was
            received by the House on May 1, 1967, but Powell did not again present himself to the
            House or ask to be given the oath of office.</p>
         <p>[6] Respondents' authority for this assertion is a footnote contained in Gojack v.
            United States, 384 U. S. 702, 707, n. 4. (1966): "Neither the House of Representatives
            nor its committees are continuing bodies."</p>
         <p>[7] The rule that this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the merits of a moot case is
            a branch of the constitutional command that the judicial power extends only to cases or
            controversies. See Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40, 57 (1968); R. Robertson &amp;amp;
            F. Kirkham, Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States &#x9e;&#x9e; 270-271
            (R. Wolfson &amp;amp; P. Kurland ed. 1951); Diamond, Federal Jurisdiction To Decide Moot
            Cases, 94 U. Pa. L. Rev. 125 (1946); Note, Cases Moot on Appeal: A Limit on the Judicial
            Power, 103 U. Pa. L. Rev. 772 (1955).</p>
         <p>[8] Petitioners do not press their claim that respondent McCormack should be required to
            administer the oath to Powell, apparently conceding that the seating of Powell has
            rendered this specific claim moot. Where several forms of relief are requested and one
            of these requests subsequently becomes moot, the Court has still considered the
            remaining requests. See Standard Fashion Co. v. Magrane-Houston Co., 258 U. S. 346, 353
            (1922). Respondents also argue that the seating of petitioner Powell has mooted the
            claims of Powell's constituents. Since this case will be remanded, that issue as well as
            petitioners' other claims can be disposed of by the court below.</p>
         <p>[9] Alejandrino's brief did not consider either the possibility that his request for
            injunctive relief had become moot or whether his salary claim required that the Court
            treat the propriety of his suspension. No brief was filed on behalf of respondents.</p>
         <p>[10] After discussing the insufficiency of Alejandrino's averments as to the officer
            responsible for his salary, the Court stated: "Were that set out, the remedy of the
            Senator would seem to be by mandamus to compel such official in the discharge of his
            ministerial duty to pay him the salary due . . . ." 271 U. S., at 534. That the
            insufficiency of Alejandrino's averments was the reason for dismissal is further
            substantiated by a later passage: "As we are not able to derive from the petition
            sufficient information upon which properly to afford such a remedy [mandamus], we must
            treat the whole cause as moot and act accordingly." Id., at 535.</p>
         <p>[11] Paragraph 18b of petitioners' complaint avers that "Leake W. Johnson, as
            Sergeant-at-Arms of the House" is responsible for and refuses to pay Powell's salary and
            prays for an injunction restraining the Sergeant at Arms from implementing the House
            resolution depriving Powell of his salary as well as mandamus to order that the salary
            be paid.</p>
         <p>[12] Federal courts were first empowered to grant declaratory judgments in 1934, see 48
            Stat. 955, 10 years after Alejandrino filed his complaint.</p>
         <p>[13] It was expressly stated in Alejandrino that a properly pleaded mandamus action
            could be brought, 271 U. S., at 535, impliedly holding that Alejandrino's salary claim
            had not been mooted by the expiration of his suspension.</p>
         <p>[14] Respondents do not supply any substantiation for their assertion that the term of
            the Georgia Legislature did not expire until December 31. Presumably, they base their
            statement upon Ga. Code Ann. &#x9e;&#x9e; 2-1601, 2-1603 (Supp. 1968).</p>
         <p>[15] Respondents also suggest that Bond is not applicable because the parties in Bond
            had stipulated that Bond would be entitled to back salary if his constitutional
            challenges were accepted, while there is no stipulation in this case. However, if the
            claim in Bond was moot, a stipulation by the parties could not confer jurisdiction. See,
            e. g., California v. San Pablo &amp;amp; Tulare R. Co., 149 U. S. 308, 314 (1893).</p>
         <p>[16] Since the court below disposed of this case on grounds of justiciability, it did
            not pass upon whether Powell had brought an appropriate action to recover his salary.
            Where a court of appeals has misconceived the applicable law and therefore failed to
            pass upon a question, our general practice has been to remand the case to that court for
            consideration of the remaining issues. See, e. g., Utah Pie Co. v. Continental Baking
            Co., 386 U. S. 685, 704 (1967); Bank of America National Trust &amp;amp; Savings Assn.
            v. Parnell, 352 U. S. 29, 34 (1956). We believe that such action is appropriate for
            resolution of whether Powell in this litigation is entitled to mandamus against the
            Sergeant at Arms for salary withheld pursuant to the House resolution.</p>
         <p>[17] Article I, &#x9e; 6, provides: "for any Speech or Debate in either House, they

         <p>[18] Petitioners ask the Court to draw a distinction between declaratory relief sought
            against members of Congress and either an action for damages or a criminal prosecution,

            deterrent nature." Brief for Petitioners 171.</p>

         <p>[25] A Congressman is not by virtue of the Speech or Debate Clause absolved of the

            the applicability of the clause to plaintiff's action. See Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.
            S. 367, 377 (1951).</p>
         <p>[26] Given our disposition of this issue, we need not decide whether under the Speech or
            Debate Clause petitioners would be entitled to maintain this action solely against
            members of Congress where no agents participated in the challenged action and no other
            remedy was available. Cf. Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U. S. 168, 204-205 (1881).</p>
         <p>[27] Powell was "excluded" from the 90th Congress, i. e., he was not administered the
            oath of office and was prevented from taking his seat. If he had been allowed to take
            the oath and subsequently had been required to surrender his seat, the House's action
            would have constituted an "expulsion." Since we conclude that Powell was excluded from
            the 90th Congress, we express no view on what limitations may exist on Congress' power
            to expel or otherwise punish a member once he has been seated.</p>
         <p>[28] House Resolution No. 278, as amended and adopted, provided: </p>
         <p>"That said Adam Clayton Powell . . . be and the same hereby is excluded from membership
            in the 90th Congress . . . ." 113 Cong. Rec. 5020. (Emphasis added.)</p>
         <p>[29] Other Congresses have expressed an identical view. The Report of the Judiciary
            Committee concerning the proposed expulsion of William S. King and John G. Schumaker
            informed the House: </p>
         <p>"Your committee are of opinion that the House of Representatives has no authority to
            take jurisdiction of violations of law or offenses committed against a previous
            Congress. This is purely a legislative body, and entirely unsuited for the trial of
            crimes. The fifth section of the first article of the Constitution authorizes `each
            house to determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly
            behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.' This power is
            evidently given to enable each house to exercise its constitutional function of
            legislation unobstructed. It cannot vest in Congress a jurisdiction to try a member for
            an offense committed before his election; for such offense a member, like any other
            citizen, is amenable to the courts alone." H. R. Rep. No. 815, 44th Cong., 1st Sess., 2
            (1876).</p>
         <p>See also 15 Cong. Rec. 4434 (1884) (ruling of the Speaker); H. R. Rep. No. 81, 42d
            Cong., 3d Sess., 8 (1873) (expulsion of James Brooks and Oakes Ames); H. R. Rep. No.
            179, 35th Cong., 1st Sess., 4-5 (1858) (expulsion of Orsamus B. Matteson).</p>
         <p>[30] We express no view as to whether such a ruling would have been proper. A further
            distinction between expulsion and exclusion inheres in the fact that a member whose
            expulsion is contemplated may as a matter of right address the House and participate
            fully in debate while a member-elect apparently does not have a similar right. In prior
            cases the member whose expulsion was under debate has been allowed to make a long and
            often impassioned defense. See Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 3d Sess., 1723 (1873) (expulsion
            of Oakes Ames); Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 2d Sess., 1524-1525, 1544 (1870) (expulsion of
            B. F. Whittemore); Cong. Globe, 34th Cong., 3d Sess., 925-926 (1857) (expulsion of
            William A. Gilbert); Cong. Globe, 34th Cong., 3d Sess., 947-951 (1857) (expulsion of
            William W. Welch); 9 Annals of Cong. 2966 (1799) (expulsion of Matthew Lyon). On at
            least one occasion the member has been allowed to cross-examine other members during the
            expulsion debate. 2 A. Hinds, Precedents of the House of Representatives &#x9e; 1643

         <p>[31] A motion for the previous question is a debate-limiting device which, when carried,

         <p>[32] Eckhardt, The Adam Clayton Powell Case, 45 Texas L. Rev. 1205, 1209 (1967). The
            views of Congressman Eckhardt were echoed during the exclusion proceedings. Congressman
            Cleveland stated that, although he voted in favor of and supported the Select
            Committee's recommendation, if the exclusion amendment received a favorable vote on the
            motion for the previous question, then he would support the amendment "on final
            passage." 113 Cong. Rec. 5031. Congressman Gubser was even more explicit: </p>
         <p>"I shall vote against the previous question on the Curtis amendment simply because I
            believe future and perfecting amendments should be allowed. But if the previous question
            is ordered, then I will be placed on the horns of an impossible dilemma.</p>
         <p>"Mr. Speaker, I want to expel Adam Clayton Powell, by seating him first, but that will
            not be my choice when the Curtis amendment is before us. I will be forced to vote for
            exclusion, about which I have great constitutional doubts, or to vote for no punishment
            at all. Given this raw and isolated issue, the only alternative I can follow is to vote
            for the Curtis amendment. I shall do so, Mr. Speaker, with great reservation." Ibid.</p>
         <p>[33] Although each judge of the panel wrote a separate opinion, all were clear in
            stating that the District Court possessed subject matter jurisdiction. Powell v.
            McCormack, 129 U. S. App. D. C. 354, 368, 384, 385, 395 F. 2d 577, 591, 607, 608
            (1968).</p>
         <p>[34] We have determined that the case is not moot. See Part II, supra.</p>
         <p>[35] Indeed, the thrust of respondents' argument on this jurisdictional issue is similar
            to their contentions that this case presents a nonjusticiable "political question." They
            urge that it would have been "unthinkable" to the Framers of the Constitution for courts
            to review the decision of a legislature to exclude a member. However, we have previously
            determined that a claim alleging that a legislature has abridged an individual's
            constitutional rights by refusing to seat an elected representative constitutes a "case
            or controversy" over which federal courts have jurisdiction. See Bond v. Floyd, 385 U.
            S. 116, 131 (1966). To the extent the expectations of the Framers are discernible and
            relevant to this case, they must therefore relate to the special problem of review by
            federal courts of actions of the federal legislature. This is of course a problem of
            separation of powers and is to be considered in determining justiciability. See Baker v.
            Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 210 (1962).</p>
         <p>[36] Brief for Respondents 39.</p>
         <p>[37] Petitioners' complaint is predicated, inter alia, on several sections of Article I,
            Article III, and several amendments to the Constitution. Respondents do not challenge
            the substantiality of these claims.</p>
         <p>[38] Act of May 31, 1870, &#x9e; 23, 16 Stat. 146. The statute is now 28 U. S. C. &#x9e;
            1344.</p>
         <p>[39] See Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 2d Sess., 3872 (1870).</p>
         <p>[40] Respondents rely on Barry v. United States ex rel. Cunningham, 279 U. S. 597
            (1929). Barry involved the power of the Senate to issue an arrest warrant to summon a
            witness to give testimony concerning a senatorial election. The Court ruled that
            issuance of the warrant was constitutional, relying on the power of the Senate under
            Art. I, &#x9e; 5, to be the judge of the elections of its members. Respondents
            particularly rely on language the Court used in discussing the power conferred by Art.
            I, &#x9e; 5. The Court noted that under &#x9e; 5 the Senate could "render a judgment
            which is beyond the authority of any other tribunal to review." Id., at 613. </p>
         <p>Barry provides no support for respondents' argument that this case is not justiciable,
            however. First, in Barry the Court reached the merits of the controversy, thus
            indicating that actions allegedly taken pursuant to Art. I, &#x9e; 5, are not
            automatically immune from judicial review. Second, the quoted statement is dictum; and,
            later in the same opinion, the Court noted that the Senate may exercise its power
            subject "to the restraints imposed by or found in the implications of the Constitution."
            Id., at 614. Third, of course, the statement in Barry leaves open the particular
            question that must first be resolved in this case: the existence and scope of the
            textual commitment to the House to judge the qualifications of members.</p>
         <p>[41] In addition to the three qualifications set forth in Art. I, &#x9e; 2, Art. I,
            &#x9e; 3, cl. 7, authorizes the disqualification of any person convicted in an
            impeachment proceeding from "any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United
            States"; Art. I, &#x9e; 6, cl. 2, provides that "no Person holding any Office under the
            United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office"; and
            &#x9e; 3 of the 14th Amendment disqualifies any person "who, having previously taken an
            oath . . . to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in
            insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies
            thereof." It has been argued that each of these provisions, as well as the Guarantee
            Clause of Article IV and the oath requirement of Art. VI, cl. 3, is no less a
            "qualification" within the meaning of Art. I, &#x9e; 5, than those set forth in Art. I,
            &#x9e; 2. Dionisopoulos, A Commentary on the Constitutional Issues in the Powell and
            Related Cases, 17 J. Pub. L. 103, 111-115 (1968). We need not reach this question,
            however, since both sides agree that Powell was not ineligible under any of these
            provisions.</p>
         <p>[42] Consistent with this interpretation, federal courts might still be barred by the
            political question doctrine from reviewing the House's factual determination that a
            member did not meet one of the standing qualifications. This is an issue not presented
            in this case and we express no view as to its resolution.</p>
         <p>[43] Indeed, the force of respondents' other arguments that this case presents a
            political question depends in great measure on the resolution of the textual commitment
            question. See Part VI, B (2), infra.</p>
         <p>[44] Since Art. I, &#x9e; 5, cl. 1, applies to both Houses of Congress, the scope of the
            Senate's power to judge the qualifications of its members necessarily is identical to
            the scope of the House's power, with the exception, of course, that Art. I, &#x9e; 3,
            cl. 3, establishes different age and citizenship requirements for membership in the
            Senate.</p>
         <p>[45] Since the reign of Henry IV (1399-1413), no clergyman had sat in the House of
            Commons. 1 E. Porritt, The Unreformed House of Commons 125 (1963).</p>
         <p>[46] Because the British do not have a written constitution, standing incapacities or
            disqualifications for membership in Parliament are derived from "the custom and law of
            parliament." 1 W. Blackstone's Commentaries *162; see id., at *175. The groups thus
            disqualified as of 1770 included aliens; minors; judges who sat in the House of Lords;
            clergy who were represented in their own convocation; persons "attainted of treason or
            felony"; sheriffs, mayors, and bailiffs as representatives for their own jurisdictions;
            and certain taxing officials and officers of the Crown. Id., at *175-176. Not until the
            exclusion of John Wilkes, discussed infra, did Blackstone subscribe to the theory that,
            in addition, the Commons could declare ineligible an individual "in particular
            [unspecified] circumstances . . . for that parliament" if it deemed him unfit to serve
            on grounds not encompassed by the recognized standing incapacities. As we explain,
            infra, this position was subsequently repudiated by the House in 1782. A Clerk of the
            House of Commons later referred to cases in which this theory was relied upon "as
            examples of an excess of . . . jurisdiction by the Commons; for one house of Parliament
            cannot create a disability unknown to the law." T. May's Parliamentary Practice 67 (13th
            ed. T. Webster 1924).</p>
         <p>[47] In 1619, the Virginia House of Burgesses challenged the eligibility of certain
            delegates on the ground that they did not hold their plantations under proper patents
            from the Virginia Company in England. See generally 7 The Federal and State
            Constitutions, Colonial Charters, and Other Organic Laws 3783-3810 (F. Thorpe ed. 1909)
            (hereinafter cited as Thorpe). One of them, a Captain Warde, was admitted on condition
            that he obtain the necessary patent. The others, representatives from Martin's Brandon
            plantation, were excluded on the ground that the owner of the plantation had claimed
            that his patent exempted him from the colony's laws. See Journals of the House of
            Burgesses of Virginia: 1619-1658/59, pp. 4-5 (1915); M. Clarke, Parliamentary Privilege
            in the American Colonies 133-134 (1943). The questions presented by these two cases,
            therefore, seem to be jurisdictional in nature; that is, an attempt was made to gain
            representation for plantations over which the assembly may have had no power to act.
            Thus viewed these cases are analogous to the exclusions for failure to comply with
            standing qualifications. They certainly are not precedents which support the view that a
            legislative body could exclude members for mere character defects or prior misconduct
            disapproved by the assembly. See generally Clarke, supra, at 132-204; J. Greene, The
            Quest for Power: The Lower Houses of Assembly in the Southern Royal Colonies: 1689-1776,
            pp. 171-204 (1963).</p>
         <p>[48] For example, in 1585 the Commons expelled a Doctor Parry for unspecified
            misbehavior. A Compleat Journal of the Votes, Speeches and Debates of the House of Lords
            and House of Commons Throughout the Whole Reign of Queen Elizabeth, of Glorious Memory
            352 (S. D'Ewes ed. 1708); and in 1628 Sir Edmund Sawyer was expelled because he had
            sought to induce a witness to suppress evidence against Sir Edmund in testimony before
            the House. 1 H. C. Jour. 917.</p>
         <p>[49] In expelling Sir Edmund Sawyer in 1628, the Commons declared "him to be unworthy
            ever to serve as a Member of this House." Ibid. Almost identical language was used in
            the expulsion of H. Benson in 1641. 2 id., at 301. But by 1642, the formula had been
            changed to "disabled to serve any longer in this Parliament as a Member of this House .
            . . ." Id., at 703. (Emphasis added.) By the 18th century it was apparently well
            established that an expulsion by the House of Commons could last no longer than the
            duration of the Parliament from which the member was expelled. See 1 W. Blackstone's
            Commentaries *176.</p>
         <p>[50] For example, in 1652, the Virginia House of Burgesses expelled two members for
            prior conduct disapproved by the assembly, Journals of the House of Burgesses, supra, at
            85; and in 1683, Rhode Island expelled a member "from acting in this present Assembly"
            for refusing to answer a court summons. 1 S. Arnold, History of the State of Rhode

            173-204.</p>
         <p>[51] In 1726, the Massachusetts House of Representatives excluded Gershom Woodle, who
            had been expelled on three previous occasions as "unworthy to be a Member." 7 Journals
            of the House of Representatives of Massachusetts 1726-1727, pp. 4-5, 15, 68-69 (1926).
            In 1758, North Carolina expelled Francis Brown for perjury. He was re-elected twice in
            1760 and excluded on both occasions; however, when he was elected at the 1761 general
            elections, he was allowed to take his seat. 5 Colonial Records of North Carolina
            1057-1058 (1887); 6 id., at 375, 474, 662-663, 672-673 (1888). There may have been
            similar exclusions of two men elected in 1710 to the New Jersey Assembly. See Clarke,
            supra, at 197-198.</p>
         <p>[52] Significantly, the occasional assumption of this broader expulsion power did not go
            unchallenged, Clarke, supra, at 196-202; and it was not supported by the only
            parliamentary precedent, the Walpole case.</p>
         <p>[53] Pursuant to a general warrant, Wilkes was arrested, his home ransacked, and his
            private papers seized. In his later election campaigns, Wilkes denounced the use of
            general warrants, asserting that he was fighting for liberty itself. See 11 L. Gipson,
            The British Empire Before the American Revolution 213-214 (1965).</p>
         <p>[54] The issue before the Commons was clear: Could the Commons "put in any
            disqualification, that is not put in by the law of the land." 1 H. Cavendish's Debates
            384 (J. Wright ed. 1841). The affirmative answer was somewhat less than resounding.
            After Wilkes' third re-election, the motion to seat his opponent carried 197 to 143.</p>
         <p>[55] The validity of the House's action against Wilkes rested to a large extent on the
            validity of the Walpole precedent. Taswell-Langmead, supra, at 585. Thus, the House of
            Commons resolution expunging, as subversive to the rights of the whole electorate, the
            action taken against Wilkes was also a tacit repudiation of the similar action taken
            against Walpole in 1712.</p>
         <p>[56] English law is apparently the same today. See T. May's Parliamentary Practice
            105-108 (17th ed. B. Cocks 1964).</p>
         <p>[57] The Council of Censors was established by the 1776 Pennsylvania Constitution. It
            was an elected body that was specifically charged with the duty "to enquire whether the
            constitution has been preserved inviolate in every part; and whether the legislative and
            executive branches of government have performed their duty as guardians of the people,
            or assumed to themselves, or exercised other or greater powers than they are intitled to
            by the constitution." Pa. Const. of 1776, &#x9e; 47, 5 Thorpe 3091. See Pennsylvania
            Convention Proceedings: 1776 and 1790, Introduction, p. IV (1825).</p>
         <p>[58] In discussing the case, respondents characterize the earlier action as an
            exclusion. The Council of Censors, however, stated that the general assembly had
            resolved that the member "is expelled from his seat." Pennsylvania Convention
            Proceedings, supra, at 89. The account of the dissenting committee members suggests that
            the term expulsion was properly used. They note that in February 1783 the assembly
            received a letter from the Comptroller General charging the assemblyman with fraud. Not
            until September 9, 1783, did the assembly vote to expel him. Presumably, he held his
            seat until that time. But, even if he had been excluded, arguably he was excluded for
            not meeting a standing incapacity, since the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 required
            assemblymen to be "most noted for wisdom and virtue." Pa. Const. of 1776, &#x9e; 7, 5
            Thorpe 3084. (Emphasis added.) In fact, the dissenting members of the Committee argued
            that the expelled member was ineligible under this very provision. Pennsylvania
            Convention Proceedings, supra, at 89. </p>
         <p>Respondents cite one other exclusion during the period between the Declaration of
            Independence and the Constitutional Convention 11 years later. In 1780 the Virginia
            Assembly excluded John Breckenridge because he was a minor. Minority, of course, was a
            traditional standing incapacity, and Charles Warren therefore appears to have been
            correct in concluding that this exclusion was probably based upon an interpretation of
            the state constitutional requirement that members must be duly qualified according to
            law. Va. Const., 7 Thorpe 3816. See C. Warren, The Making of the Constitution 423, n. 1
            (1928). Respondents, based upon their misinterpretation of the Pennsylvania case just
            discussed, criticize Charles Warren for concluding that there had been only one
            exclusion during this period. Our research, however, has disclosed no other cases.</p>
         <p>[59] Wilkes had established a reputation both in England and the Colonies as a champion
            of free elections, freedom from arbitrary arrest and seizure, and freedom of the press.
            See 11 Gipson, supra, at 191-222.</p>
         <p>[60] See R. Postgate, That Devil Wilkes 171-172, 173-174 (1929). During the House of
            Commons debates in 1781, a member remarked that expelling Wilkes had been "one of the
            great causes which had separated . . . [England] from America." 22 Parl. Hist. Eng.
            100-101 (1781). </p>
         <p>The writings of the pamphleteer "Junius" were widely reprinted in colonial newspapers
            and lent considerable support to the revolutionary cause. See 3 Dictionary of American
            History 190 (1940). Letter XVIII of the "Letters of Junius" bitterly attacked the
            exclusion of Wilkes. This letter, addressed to Blackstone, asserted:</p>
         <p>"You cannot but know, sir, that what was Mr. Wilkes's case yesterday may be yours or
            mine to-morrow, and that, consequently the common right of every subject of the realm is
            invaded by it. . . . If the expulsion of a member, not under any legal disability, of
            itself creates in him an incapacity to be elected, I see a ready way marked out, by
            which the majority may, at any time, remove the honestest and ablest men who happen to
            be in opposition to them. To say that they will not make this extravagant use of their
            power would be a language unfit for a man so learned in the laws as you are. By your
            doctrine, sir, they have the power: and laws, you know, are intended to guard against
            what men may do, not to trust to what they will do." 1 Letters of Junius, Letter XVIII,
            p. 118 (1821).</p>
         <p>[61] See Warren, supra, at 399-426.</p>
         <p>[62] Dickinson also said that a built-in veneration for wealth would be inconsistent
            with the republican ideal that merit alone should determine who holds the public trust.

         <p>[63] On August 10, a delegate moved to reconsider the citizenship qualification. The
            delegate proposed to substitute a three-year requirement for the seven-year requirement
            already agreed upon. The motion passed. Id., at 251. However, when this proposal was
            considered on August 13, it was rejected. Id., at 265-266.</p>
         <p>[64] Charles Pinckney proposed that the President, judges, and legislators of the United
            States be required to swear that they possessed a specified amount of unincumbered
            property. Benjamin Franklin expressed his strong opposition, observing that "[s]ome of
            the greatest rogues he was ever acquainted with, were the richest rogues." Id., at 249.
            He voiced the fear that a property requirement would "discourage the common people from
            removing to this Country." Ibid. Thereafter, "the Motion of Mr. Pinkney [sic] was
            rejected by so general a no, that the States were not called." Ibid. (Emphasis in
            original.)</p>
         <p>[65] "That the right of the electors to be represented by men of their own choice, was
            so essential for the preservation of all their other rights, that it ought to be
            considered as one of the most sacred parts of our constitution. . . . That the law of
            the land had regulated the qualifications of members to serve in parliament, and that
            the freeholders . . . had an indisputable right to return whom they thought proper,
            provided he was not disqualified by any of those known laws. . . . They are not
            occasional but fixed: to rule and govern the question as it shall arise; not to start up
            on a sudden, and shift from side to side, as the caprice of the day or the fluctuation
            of party shall direct." 16 Parl. Hist. Eng. 589-590 (1769).</p>
         <p>[66] Id., at 589.</p>
         <p>[67] Wilkes had made essentially the same argument in one of his early attempts to have
            the resolutions denying him a seat expunged: </p>
         <p>"This usurpation, if acquiesced under, would be attended with the most alarming
            consequences. If you can reject those disagreeable to a majority, and expel whom you
            please, the House of Commons will be self-created and self-existing. You may expel till
            you approve, and thus in effect you nominate. The original idea of this House being the
            representative of the Commons of the realm will be lost." 18 Parl. Hist. Eng. 367
            (1775).</p>
         <p>[68] Charles Warren concluded that "Madison's reference was undoubtedly to the famous
            election case of John Wilkes . . . ." Warren, supra, at 420, n. 1. It is also possible,
            however, that he was referring to the Parliamentary Test Act, 30 Car. 2, Stat. 2, c. 1
            (1678), which had excluded Catholics as a group from serving in Parliament.</p>
         <p>[69] Charles Warren, upon whose interpretation of these events petitioners rely,
            concluded that the Convention's decision to reject Gouverneur Morris' proposal and the
            more limited proposal of the Committee of Detail was an implicit adoption of Madison's
            position that the qualifications of the elected "were fundamental articles in a
            Republican Govt. and ought to be fixed by the Constitution." 2 Farrand 249-250. See
            Warren, supra, at 420-421. Certainly, Warren argued, "[s]uch action would seem to make
            it clear that the Convention did not intend to grant to a single branch of Congress . .
            . the right to establish any qualifications for its members, other than those
            qualifications established by the Constitution itself . . . . For certainly it did not
            intend that a single branch of Congress should possess a power which the Convention had
            expressly refused to vest in the whole Congress." Id., at 421. See 1 J. Story,
            Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States &#x9e; 625, at 445 (1873).
            Although Professor Chafee argued that congressional precedents do not support this
            construction, he nevertheless stated that forbidding any additions to the qualifications
            expressed in the Constitution was "the soundest policy." Z. Chafee, Free Speech in the
            United States 256 (1941).</p>
         <p>[70] See 10 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 540-542 (1938).</p>
         <p>[71] Holdsworth notes that in the first edition of Blackstone's Commentaries Blackstone
            enumerated various incapacities and then concluded that "subject to these standing
            restrictions and disqualifications, every subject of the realm is eligible [for
            membership in the House of Commons] of common right." 1 W. Blackstone's Commentaries
            *176. Blackstone was called upon in Commons to defend Wilkes' exclusion and the passage
            was quoted against him. Blackstone retaliated by writing a pamphlet and making two
            additions to later editions of his Commentaries in an effort to justify the decision of
            Parliament. Holdsworth, supra, at 540-541.</p>
         <p>[72] Appendix D to Brief for Respondents 52.</p>
         <p>[73] Warren, supra, at 422, n. 1. Charles Warren buttressed his conclusion by nothing
            that the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780 "contained affirmative qualifications for
            Representatives and exactly similar negative qualifications for Senators." Ibid.
            Apparently, these provisions were not considered substantively different, for each house
            was empowered in identical language to "judge of the elections, returns and
            qualifications of their own members, as pointed out in the constitution." Mass. Const.,
            pt. 2, c. I, &#x9e; 2, Art. IV, 3 Thorpe 1897, and &#x9e; 3, Art. X, 3 Thorpe 1899.
            (Emphasis added.) See Warren, supra, at 422-423, n. 1.</p>
         <p>[74] In No. 52 of The Federalist, Madison stated: </p>
         <p>"The qualifications of the elected, being less carefully and properly defined by the
            State constitutions, and being at the same time more susceptible of uniformity, have
            been very properly considered and regulated by the convention. [He then enumerated the
            qualifications for both representatives and Senators.] . . . Under these reasonable
            limitations, the door of this part of the federal government is open to merit of every
            description, whether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and without regard to
            poverty or wealth, or to any particular profession or religious faith." The Federalist
            Papers 326 (Mentor ed. 1961).</p>
         <p>[75] Respondents dismiss Madison's assertion that the "qualifications of the elected, .
            . . being at the same time more susceptible of uniformity, have been very properly
            considered and regulated by the convention," as nothing more than a refutation of the
            charge that the new national legislature would be free to establish additional "standing
            incapacities." However, this conclusion cannot be reconciled with the pre-Convention
            history on this question, the Convention debates themselves, and, in particular, the
            delegates' decision to require a two-thirds vote for expulsion.</p>
         <p>[76] At the same convention, Robert Livingston, one of the new Constitution's most
            ardent supporters and one of the State's most substantial landowners, endorsed this same
            fundamental principle: "The people are the best judges who ought to represent them. To
            dictate and control them, to tell them whom they shall not elect, is to abridge their
            natural rights." 2 Elliot's Debates 292-293.</p>
         <p>[77] Appendix D to Brief for Respondents 62.</p>
         <p>[78] In 1797, during the 5th Congress, 1st Session, the House considered expelling
            Matthew Lyon, a Republican, for sedition. The vote to expel, however, was 49 to 45, and
            broke down largely along partisan lines. Although Lyon's opponents, the Federalists,
            retained a majority in the 6th Congress, to which Lyon was re-elected, and although
            there were political advantages to be gained from trying to prevent him from taking his
            seat, there was no effort made to exclude him. See Dionisopoulos, A Commentary on the
            Constitutional Issues in the Powell and Related Cases, 17 J. Pub. L. 103, 123-127
            (1968).</p>
         <p>[79] Another Maryland representative was unsuccessfully challenged in 1808 on grounds
            almost identical to those asserted in the challenge of McCreery. See 18 Annals of Cong.
            1848-1849 (1808). In 1844, the Senate declined to exclude John M. Niles, who was accused
            of being mentally incompetent, after a special committee reported him competent. Cong.
            Globe, 28th Cong., 1st Sess., 564-565, 602 (1844). In 1856, the House rejected an
            attempt to exclude Samuel Marshall for violating an Illinois law prohibiting state
            judges from running for other offices. 1 Hinds &#x9e; 415. That same year, the Senate
            refused to exclude Lyman Trumbull for violating the same Illinois law. Ibid.</p>
         <p>[80] Between 1862 and 1867, both the House and Senate resisted several attempts to
            exclude members-elect who were accused of being disloyal to the Union during the Civil
            War. See, id., &#x9e;&#x9e; 448, 455, 458; Senate Election, Expulsion and Censure Cases,
            S. Doc. No. 71, 87th Cong., 2d Sess., 21 (1962) (hereinafter cited as Senate Cases).</p>
         <p>[81] That same year the Senate also excluded a supporter of the Confederacy. Senate
            Cases 40. The House excluded two others shortly thereafter, one for the same offense,
            and another for selling appointments to the Military and Naval Academies. See 1 Hinds
            &#x9e;&#x9e; 459, 464; 2 Hinds &#x9e; 1273.</p>
         <p>[82] This departure from previous House construction of its power to exclude was
            emphasized by Congressman William P. Fessenden: "[T]he power which we have under the
            Constitution to judge of the qualifications of members of the body is not a mere
            arbitrary power, to be exerted according to the will of the individuals who may vote
            upon the subject. It ought to be a power subject to certain rules and founded upon
            certain principles. So it was up to a very late period, until the rebellion. The rule
            simply was, if a man came here and presented proper credentials from his State, to allow
            him to take the ordinary oath, which we all took, to support the Constitution, and be
            admitted, and if there was any objection to him to try that question afterward." Cong.
            Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., 685 (1868).</p>
         <p>[83] For example, in 1870, the House refused to exclude a Texas Congressman accused of a
            variety of criminal acts, 1 Hinds &#x9e; 465; but in 1882 and again in 1900 the House
            excluded a member-elect for practicing polygamy. 1 Hinds &#x9e;&#x9e; 473, 477-480.
            Thereafter, it apparently did not consider excluding anyone until shortly after World
            War I, when it twice excluded Victor L. Berger, an avowed Socialist, for giving aid and
            comfort to the enemy. Significantly, the House committee investigating Berger concluded
            that he was ineligible under the express provision of &#x9e; 3 of the Fourteenth
            Amendment. 6 C. Cannon, Precedents of the House of Representatives of the United States
            &#x9e;&#x9e; 56-59 (1935) (hereinafter cited as Cannon). Berger, the last person to be
            excluded from the House prior to Powell, was later re-elected and finally admitted after
            his criminal conviction was reversed. 65 Cong. Rec. 7 (1923). </p>
         <p>The House next considered the problem in 1925 when it contemplated excluding John W.
            Langley for his alleged misconduct. Langley resigned after losing a criminal appeal, and
            the House therefore never voted upon the question. 6 Cannon &#x9e; 238. The most recent
            exclusion attempt prior to Powell's occurred in 1933, when the House refused to exclude
            a Representative from Minnesota who had been convicted of sending defamatory matter
            through the mail. See 77 Cong. Rec. 73-74, 131-139 (1933).</p>
         <p>The Senate has not excluded anyone since 1929; in that year it refused to seat a
            member-elect because of improper campaign expenditures. 6 Cannon &#x9e; 180. In 1947, a
            concerted effort was made to exclude Senator Theodore G. Bilbo of Mississippi for
            allegedly accepting gifts from war contractors and illegally intimidating Negroes in
            Democratic primaries. See 93 Cong. Rec. 3-28 (1947). He died, however, before a decision
            was reached.</p>
         <p>[84] During the debates over H. R. Res. No. 278, Congressman Celler, chairman of both
            the Select Committee and the Judiciary Committee, forcefully insisted that the
            Constitution "unalterably fixes and defines" the qualifications for membership in the
            House and that any other construction of Art. I, &#x9e; 5, would be "improper and
            dangerous." 113 Cong. Rec. 4998. See H. R. Rep. No. 484, 43d Cong., 1st Sess., 11-15
            (1874) (views of minority); H. R. Rep. No. 85, 56th Cong., 1st Sess., 53-77 (1900)
            (views of minority). In the latter report, the dissenters argued: "A small partisan
            majority might render the desire to arbitrarily exclude, by a majority vote, in order to
            more securely intrench itself in power, irresistible. Hence its exercise is controlled
            by legal rules. In case of expulsion, when the requisite two-thirds can be had, the
            motive for the exercise of arbitrary power no longer exists, as a two-thirds partisan
            majority is sufficient for every purpose. . . . The power of exclusion is matter of law,
            to be exercised by a majority vote, in accordance with legal principles, and exists only
            where a member-elect lacks some of the qualifications required by the Constitution."
            Id., at 76-77.</p>
         <p>[85] "Determining the basis for a congressional action is itself difficult; since a
            congressional action, unlike a reported judicial decision, contains no statement of the
            reasons for the disposition, one must fall back on the debates and the committee
            reports. If more than one issue is raised in the debates, one can never be sure on what
            basis the action was predicated. Unlike a court, which is presumed to be disinterested,
            in an exclusion case the concerned house is in effect a party to the controversy that it
            must adjudicate. Consequently, some members may be inclined to vote for exclusion though
            they strongly doubt its constitutionality." 81 Harv. L. Rev., at 679.</p>
         <p>[86] In fact, the Court has noted that it is an "inadmissible suggestion" that action
            might be taken in disregard of a judicial determination. McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U. S.
            1, 24 (1892).</p>
         <p>[1] U. S. Const., Art. I, &#x9e; 2, cl. 2: </p>
         <p>"No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty
            five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when
            elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen."</p>
         <p>[2] The Constitutional Convention had the occasion to consider several proposals for
            giving Congress discretion to shape its own qualifications for office and explicitly
            rejected them. James Madison led the opposition by arguing that such discretion would be
            "an improper &amp;amp; dangerous power in the Legislature. The qualifications of
            electors and elected were fundamental articles in a Republican Govt. and ought to be
            fixed by the Constitution. If the Legislature could regulate those of either, it can by
            degrees subvert the Constitution." 2 M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of
            1787, pp. 249-250 (1911). </p>
         <p>Alexander Hamilton echoed that same conclusion:</p>
         <p>"The qualifications of the persons who may choose or be chosen, as has been remarked
            upon other occasions, are defined and fixed in the Constitution, and are unalterable by
            the legislature." The <ref type="intent" num="60">Federalist</ref> Papers, No. 60, p.
            371 (Mentor ed. 1961).</p>
         <p>And so, too, the early Congress of 1807 decided to seat Representative-elect William
            McCreery on the ground that its power to "judge" was limited by the enumerated
            qualifications.</p>
         <p>"The Committee of Elections considered the qualifications of members to have been
            unalterably determined by the Federal Convention, unless changed by an authority equal
            to that which framed the Constitution at first . . . . Congress, by the Federal
            Constitution, are not authorized to prescribe the qualifications of their own members,
            but they are authorized to judge of their qualifications; in doing so, however, they
            must be governed by the rules prescribed by the Federal Constitution, and by them only."
            17 Annals of Cong. 872 (1807) (remarks of Rep. Findley, Chairman of House Committee of
            Elections).</p>
         <p>Constitutional scholars of two centuries have reaffirmed the principle that
            congressional power to "judge" the qualifications of its members is limited to those
            enumerated in the Constitution. 1 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 462 (5th
            ed. 1891); C. Warren, The Making of the Constitution 420-426 (1928). See also remarks by
            Emmanuel Celler, Chairman of the House Select Committee which inquired into the
            qualifications of Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., and which recommended seating him:</p>
         <p>"The Constitution lays down three qualifications for one to enter CongressÔÇöage,
            inhabitancy, citizenship. Mr. Powell satisfies all three. The House cannot add to these
            qualifications." 113 Cong. Rec. 4998.</p>
         <p>[3] Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 242, n. 2 (DOUGLAS, J., concurring).</p>
         <p>[4] The question whether Congress has authority under the Constitution to add to
            enumerated qualifications for office is itself a federal question within the particular
            expertise of this Court. Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 211. Where that authority has
            been exceeded, redress may be properly sought here. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137.
            Congress itself suspected no less in deciding to exclude Rep. Powell: </p>
         <p>"[C]ases may readily be postulated where the action of a House in excluding or expelling
            a Member may directly impinge upon rights under other provisions of the Constitution. In
            such cases, the unavailability of judicial review may be less certain. Suppose, for
            example, that a Member was excluded or expelled because of his religion or race,
            contrary to the equal protection clause, or for making an unpopular speech protected by
            the first amendment . . . . [E]xclusion of the Member-elect on grounds other than age,
            citizenship, or inhabitancy could raise an equally serious constitutional issue." H. R.

         <p>[5] With the exception of Gray, the "continuing controversy" cases relied on by the
            petitioners were actions by the Government or its agencies to halt illegal conduct of
            the defendants, and, by example, of others engaged in similar conduct. See cases cited,
            supra, nn. 1, 3, 4. The principle that voluntary abandonment of an illegal practice will
            not make an action moot is especially, if not exclusively, applicable to such public law
            enforcement suits. </p>
         <p>"Private parties may settle their controversies at any time, and rights which a
            plaintiff may have had at the time of the commencement of the action may terminate
            before judgment is obtained or while the case is on appeal, and in any such case the
            court, being informed of the facts, will proceed no further in the action. Here,
            however, there has been no extinguishment of the rights . . . of the public, the
            enforcement of which the Government has endeavored to procure by a judgment of a court .
            . . . The defendants cannot foreclose those rights nor prevent the assertion thereof by
            the Government as a substantial trustee for the public under the act of Congress, by
            [voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct]." United States v. Trans-Missouri
            Freight Assn., 166 U. S., at 309.</p>
         <p>The considerations of public enforcement of a statutory or regulatory scheme which
            inhere in those cases are not present in this litigation.</p>
         <p>[6] Certainly in every decision relied on by the petitioners the Court did not reject
            the mootness argument solely on the ground that the illegal practice had been
            voluntarily terminated. In each it proceeded to determine that there was in fact a
            continuing controversy.</p>
         <p>[7] House Resolution No. 2 provided in pertinent part: </p>
         <p>"(2) That as punishment Adam Clayton Powell be and he hereby is fined the sum of
            $25,000, said sum to be paid to the Clerk to be disposed of by him according to law. The
            Sergeant at Arms of the House is directed to deduct $1,150 per month from the salary
            otherwise due the said Adam Clayton Powell, and pay the same to said Clerk until said
            $25,000 fine is fully paid.</p>
         <p>"(3) That as further punishment the seniority of the said Adam Clayton Powell in the
            House of Representatives commence as of the date he takes the oath as a Member of the
            91st Congress."</p>
         <p>The petitioners' argument that the case is kept alive by Powell's loss of seniority, see
            ante, at 496, is founded on the mistaken assumption that the loss of seniority is
            attributable to the exclusion from the 90th Congress and that seniority would
            automatically be restored if that exclusion were declared unconstitutional. But the fact
            is that Powell was stripped of seniority by the action of the 91st Congress, action
            which is not involved in this case and which would not be affected by judicial review of
            the exclusion from the 90th Congress. Moreover, even if the conduct of the 91st Congress
            were challenged in this case, the Court would clearly have no power whatsoever to pass
            upon the propriety of such internal affairs of the House of Representatives.</p>
         <p>[8] Article I, &#x9e; 5, of the Constitution specifically empowers each House to "punish
            its Members for disorderly Behaviour."</p>
         <p>[9] The salary claim is personal to Congressman Powell, and the other petitioners
            therefore clearly have no further interest in this lawsuit.</p>
         <p>[10] The Philippines Senate was composed of 24 Senators, 22 of whom were elected, and
            two of whom were appointed by the Governor General. Alejandrino was one of the two
            appointees. See 271 U. S., at 531-532.</p>
         <p>[11] Under the Philippine Autonomy Act, 39 Stat. 545, this Court had jurisdiction to
            examine by writ of error the final judgments and decrees of the Supreme Court of the
            Philippine Islands in cases under the Constitution or statutes of the United States. A
            subsequent statute substituted the writ of certiorari. 39 Stat. 726.</p>
         <p>[12] "Section 18 [of the Autonomy Act] provides that the Senate and House respectively
            shall be the sole judges of the elections, returns and qualifications of their elective
            members, and each House may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members
            for disorderly behavior, and with the concurrence of two-thirds expel an elective
            member. The Senators and Representatives shall receive an annual compensation for their
            services to be ascertained by law and paid out of the Treasury of the Philippine

            or debate in either House they shall not be questioned in any other place." 271 U. S.,
            at 532.</p>
         <p>[13] The petitioners rely on the following passage from Bond v. Floyd, 385 U. S. 116,
            128, n. 4, as dispositive of their contention that the salary claim prevents this case
            from being moot: </p>
         <p>"A question was raised in oral argument as to whether this case might not be moot since
            the session of the House which excluded Bond was no longer in existence. The State has
            not pressed this argument, and it could not do so, because the State has stipulated that
            if Bond succeeds on this appeal he will receive back salary for the term from which he
            was excluded."</p>
         <p>I do not believe that this offhand dictum in Bond is determinative of the issue of
            mootness in this case. In the first place, as the Court in Bond noted, it was not there
            contended by any party that the case was moot. Moreover, contrary to the implication of
            the statement, the legislative term from which Bond was excluded had not ended at the
            time of the Court's decision. (The Court's decision was announced on December 5, 1966;
            Bond's term of office expired on December 31, 1966.) In any event, he had not been
            seated in a subsequent term, so the continuing controversy had not been rendered clearly
            moot by any action of the Georgia House, as it has here by the House of Representatives
            of the 91st Congress. No one suggested in Bond that the money claim was the only issue
            left in the case. Furthermore, the considerations which governed the Court's decision in
            Alejandrino were simply not present in Bond. Because of the State's stipulation, there
            was no doubt, as there is here, see infra, at 570-571, that the Court's decision would
            lead to effective relief with respect to Bond's salary claim. And finally, there was no
            suggestion that Bond had an alternative remedy, as Powell has here, see infra, at
            571-572, by which he could obtain full relief without requiring the Court to decide
            novel and delicate constitutional issues.</p>
         <p>[14] Alejandrino was the only petitioner in the case, and since he was an appointed
            Senator, it appears that there was no group of voters who remained without
            representation of their choice in the Senate during his suspension.</p>

         <p>[21] The respondents allege without contradiction that the Sergeant at Arms does not
            have sufficient funds to pay Congressman Powell's back salary claims. Separate
            appropriations for the salaries of Congressmen are made in each fiscal year, see, e. g.,
            80 Stat. 354, 81 Stat. 127, 82 Stat. 398, and, according to the respondents, "it is the
            custom of the Sergeant to turn back to the Treasury all unexpended funds at the end of
            each fiscal year." Thus, the only funds still held by the Sergeant are said to be those
            appropriated for the present fiscal year commencing July 1, 1968.</p>

            such claims only in amounts less than $10,000. 28 U. S. C. &#x9e; 1346.</p>
         <p>[23] United States v. King, ante, p. 1. The petitioners suggest that the inability of
            the Court of Claims to grant such relief might make any remedy in that court inadequate.
            But since Powell's only remaining interest in the case is to collect his salary, a money
            judgment in the Court of Claims would be just as good as, and probably better than,
            mandatory relief against the agents of the House. The petitioners also suggest that the
            Court of Claims would be unable to grant relief because of the pendency of Powell's
            claim in another court, 28 U. S. C. &#x9e; 1500, but that would, of course, constitute
            no obstacle if, as I suggest, the Court should order this action dismissed on grounds of
            mootness.</p>
         <p>[24] It is possible, for example, that the United States in such an action would not
            deny Powell's entitlement to the salary but would seek to offset that sum against the
            amounts which Powell was found by the House to have appropriated unlawfully from
            Government coffers to his own use.</p>
         <p>[25] Relying on Bank of Marin v. England, 385 U. S. 99, 101, the petitioners complain
            that it would impose undue hardship on Powell to force him to "start all over again" now
            that he has come this far in the present suit. In view of the Court's remand of this
            case for further proceedings with respect to Powell's remedy, it is at least doubtful
            that remitting him to an action in the Court of Claims would entail much more cost and
            delay than will be involved in the present case. And the inconvenience to litigants of
            further delay or litigation has never been deemed to justify departure from the sound
            principle, rooted in the Constitution, that important issues of constitutional law
            should be decided only if necessary and in cases presenting concrete and living
            controversies.</p>
