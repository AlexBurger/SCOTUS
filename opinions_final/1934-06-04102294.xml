            E. Fixel, John J. McCreary, and M. Frome Barbour were on the brief, for petitioner in

         <p>Solicitor General Biggs, with whom Assistant to the Attorney General Stanley and Messrs.

         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*574</span> MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of
            the Court.</p>
         <p>These cases, which are here on certiorari, present for decision the same question. In
            each, the plaintiff is the beneficiary under a policy for yearly renewable term
               insurance<span class="sup">[1]</span> issued during the World War pursuant to the War
            Risk Insurance Act of October 6, 1917, c. 105, <span class="star-pagination">*575</span>
            Article IV, §§ 400-405. The actions were brought in April, 1933, in federal district
            courts to recover amounts alleged to be due. In each case it is alleged that the insured
            had, before September 1, 1919 and while the policy was in force, been totally and
            permanently disabled; that he was entitled to compensation sufficient to pay the
            premiums on the policy until it matured by death; that no compensation had ever been
            paid; that the claim for payment was presented by the beneficiary after the death of the
            insured; that payment was refused; and that thereby the disagreement arose which the law
            makes a condition precedent to the right to bring suit. In No. 855, which comes here
            from the Fifth Circuit, the insured died November 27, 1924. In No. 861, which comes here
            from the Seventh Circuit, the insured died May 15, 1929.</p>
         <p>In each case, the United States demurred to the petition on the ground that the court
            was without jurisdiction to entertain the suit, because the consent of the United States
            to be sued had been withdrawn by the Act of March 20, 1933, c. 3, 48 Stat. 9, commonly
            called the Economy Act.</p>
         <p>The plaintiffs duly claimed that the Act deprived them of property without due process
            of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The district courts overruled the objection;
            sustained the demurrers and dismissed the complaints. Their judgments were affirmed by
            the circuit courts of appeals. 67 F. (2d) 490; 68 id. 442. The only question requiring
            serious consideration relates to the construction and effect to be given to the clause
            of § 17 of the Economy Act upon which the Government relies; for the character and
            incidents of War Risk Insurance and the applicable rules of constitutional law have been
            settled by decisions of this Court. The clause in question is:</p>
         <p>". . . all laws granting or pertaining to yearly renewable term insurance are hereby
            repealed. . . ."</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*576</span> First. War Risk Insurance policies are
            contracts of the United States. As consideration for the Government's obligation, the
            insured paid prescribed monthly premiums. White v. United States, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/vXM/white-v-united-states/">
                  <span class="volume">270</span>
                  <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
                  <span class="page">175</span>
               </a>
            </span>, 180. True, these contracts, unlike others, were not entered into by the United
            States for a business purpose. The policies granted insurance against death or total
            disability without medical examination, at net premium rates based on the American
            Experience Table of Mortality and three and one-half per cent interest, the United
            States bearing both the whole expense of administration and the excess mortality and
            disability cost resulting from the hazards of war. In order to effect a benevolent
            purpose heavy burdens were assumed by the Government.<span class="sup">[2]</span> But
            the policies, although not entered into for gain, are legal obligations of the same
            dignity as other contracts of the United States and possess the same legal
            incidents.</p>
         <p>War Risk Insurance, while resembling in benevolent purpose pensions, compensation
            allowances, hospital and other privileges accorded to former members of the army and
            navy or their dependents, differs from them fundamentally <span class="star-pagination"
               >*577</span> in legal incidents. Pensions, compensation allowances and privileges are
            gratuities. They involve no agreement of parties; and the grant of them creates no
            vested right. The benefits conferred by gratuities may be redistributed or withdrawn at
            any time in the discretion of Congress. United States v. Teller, <span class="citation">

            </span>, 527. On the other hand War Risk policies, being contracts, are property and
            create vested rights. The terms of these contracts are to be found in part in the
            policy, in part in the statutes under which they are issued and the regulations
            promulgated thereunder.</p>
         <p>In order to promote efficiency in administration and justice in the distribution of War
            Risk Insurance benefits, the Administration was given power to prescribe the form of
            policies and to make regulations. The form prescribed provided that the policy should be
            subject to all amendments to the original Act, to all regulations then in force or
            thereafter adopted. Within certain limits of application this form was deemed authorized
            by the Act, White v. United States, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/vXM/white-v-united-states/">
                  <span class="volume">270</span>
                  <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
                  <span class="page">175</span>
               </a>
            </span>, 180, and, as held in that case, one whose vested rights were not thereby
            disturbed could not complain of subsequent legislation affecting the terms of the
            policy. Such legislation has been frequent.<span class="sup">[3]</span> Moreover, from
            time to time, privileges granted <span class="star-pagination">*578</span> were
            voluntarily enlarged and new ones were given by the Government.<span class="sup"
               >[4]</span> But no power to curtail the amount of the benefits which Congress
            contracted to pay was reserved to Congress; and none could be given by any regulation
            promulgated by the Administrator. Prior to the Economy Act, no attempt was made to
            lessen the obligation of the Government.<span class="sup">[5]</span> Then, Congress, by
            a clause of thirteen words included in a very long section dealing with gratuities,
            repealed "all laws granting or pertaining <span class="star-pagination">*579</span> to
            yearly renewable term insurance." The repeal, if valid, abrogated outstanding contracts;
            and relieved the United States from all liability on the contracts without making
            compensation to the beneficiaries.</p>
         <p>Second. The Fifth Amendment commands that property be not taken without making just
            compensation. Valid contracts are property, whether the obligor be a private individual,
            a municipality, a State or the United States. Rights against the United States arising
            out of a contract with it are protected by the Fifth Amendment. United States v. Central

            </span>, 64, 67. When the United States enters into contract relations, its rights and
            duties therein are governed generally by the law applicable to contracts between private
               individuals.<span class="sup">[6]</span> That the contracts of war risk insurance
            were valid when made is not questioned. As Congress had the power to authorize the
            Bureau of War Risk Insurance to issue them, the due process clause prohibits the United
            States from annulling them, unless, indeed, the action taken falls within the federal
            police power or some other paramount power.<span class="sup">[7]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The Solicitor General does not suggest, either in brief or argument, that there were
            supervening conditions <span class="star-pagination">*580</span> which authorized
            Congress to abrogate these contracts in the exercise of the police or any other power.
            The title of the Act of March 20, 1933, repels any such suggestion. Although popularly
            known as the Economy Act, it is entitled an "Act to maintain the credit of the United
            States." Punctilious fulfillment of contractual obligations is essential to the
            maintenance of the credit of public as well as private debtors. No doubt there was in
            March, 1933, great need of economy. In the administration of all government business
            economy had become urgent because of lessened revenues and the heavy obligations to be
            issued in the hope of relieving widespread distress. Congress was free to reduce
            gratuities deemed excessive. But Congress was without power to reduce expenditures by
            abrogating contractual obligations of the United States. To abrogate contracts, in the
            attempt to lessen government expenditure, would be not the practice of economy, but an
            act of repudiation. "The United States are as much bound by their contracts as are
            individuals. If they repudiate their obligations, it is as much repudiation, with all
            the wrong and reproach that term implies, as it would be if the repudiator had been a
            State or a municipality or a citizen." Sinking-Fund Cases, <span class="citation">

         <p>Third. Contracts between individuals or corporations are impaired within the meaning of
            the Constitution whenever the right to enforce them by legal process is taken away or
            materially lessened.<span class="sup">[8]</span> A different rule prevails in respect to
            contracts of sovereigns. Compare Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, ante, p. 313.
            "The contracts between a Nation and an individual are only binding on the conscience of
            the sovereign and have no <span class="star-pagination">*581</span> pretensions to
            compulsive force. They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign
               will."<span class="sup">[9]</span> The rule that the United States may not be sued
            without its consent is all embracing.</p>
         <p>In establishing the system of War Risk Insurance, Congress vested in its administrative
            agency broad power in making determinations of essential facts &#x97; power similar to
            that exercised in respect to pensions, compensation, allowances and other gratuitous
            privileges provided for veterans and their dependents. But while the statutes granting
            gratuities contain no specific provision for suits against the United States,<span
               class="sup">[10]</span> Congress, as if to emphasize the contractual obligation
            assumed by the United States when issuing War Risk policies, conferred upon
            beneficiaries substantially the same legal remedy which beneficiaries enjoy under
            policies issued by private corporations. The original Act provided in § 405:</p>
         <p>"That in the event of disagreement as to a claim under the contract of insurance between
            the bureau and any beneficiary or beneficiaries thereunder, an action on the claim may
            be brought against the United States in the district court of the United States in and
            for the district in which such beneficiaries or any one of them resides."<span
               class="sup">[11]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Although consent to sue was thus given when the policy issued, Congress retained power
            to withdraw the consent at any time. For consent to sue the United States is a privilege
            accorded; not the grant of a property right protected by the Fifth Amendment. The
            consent may be withdrawn, although given after much deliberation and for a pecuniary
            consideration. DeGroot v. United States, <span class="star-pagination">*582</span>

            contract as distinguished from tort &#x97; may be important in determining (as under the
            Tucker Act) whether consent to sue was given. Otherwise, it is of no significance. For
            immunity from suit is an attribute of sovereignty which may not be bartered away.</p>
         <p>Mere withdrawal of consent to sue on policies for yearly renewable term insurance would
            not imply repudiation. When the United States creates rights in individuals against

            </span>, 576. And withdrawal of all remedy, administrative as well as legal, would not
            necessarily imply repudiation. So long as the contractual obligation is recognized,
            Congress may direct its fulfilment without the interposition of either a court or an
            administrative tribunal.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*583</span> Fourth. The question requiring decision is,
            therefore, whether in repealing "all laws granting or pertaining to yearly renewable
            term insurance" Congress aimed at the right or merely at the remedy. It seems clear that
            it intended to take away the right; and that Congress did not intend to preserve the
            right and merely withdraw consent to sue the United States.<span class="sup">[13]</span>
            As Congress took away the contractual right it had no occasion to provide for withdrawal
            of the remedy. Moreover, it appears both from the language of the repealing clause and
            from the context of § 17 that Congress did not aim at the remedy. The clause makes no
            mention of consent to sue. The consent to sue had been given originally by § 405 of the
            Act of 1917, which, like the later substituted sections, applied to all kinds of
            insurance, making no specific reference to yearly renewable term policies. Obviously,
            Congress did not intend to repeal generally the section providing for suits.<span
               class="sup">[14]</span> For in March 1933, most of the policies then outstanding were
            "converted" policies, in no way affected by the Economy Act.<span class="sup"
               >[15]</span>
         </p>
         <p>That Congress sought to take away the right of beneficiaries of yearly renewable term
            policies and not to withdraw their privilege to sue the United States, appears, also,
            from an examination of the other provisions of § 17. The section reads:</p>
         <p>"All public laws granting medical or hospital treatment, domiciliary care, compensation
            and other allowances, pensions, <span class="star-pagination">*584</span> disability
            allowance, or retirement pay to veterans and the dependents of veterans of the
            Spanish-American War, including the Boxer Rebellion and the Philippine Insurrection, and
            the World War, or to former members of the military and naval service for injury or
            disease incurred or aggravated in the line of duty in the military or naval service
            (except so far as they relate to persons who served prior to the Spanish-American War
            and to the dependents of such persons, and the retirement of officers and enlisted men
            of the Regular Army, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard) are hereby repealed, and all
            laws granting or pertaining to yearly renewable term insurance are hereby repealed, but
            payments in accordance with such laws shall continue to the last day of the third
            calendar month following the month during which this Act is enacted."<span class="sup"
               >[16]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*585</span> That section deals principally with the many
            grants of gratuities to veterans and dependents of veterans. Congress apparently assumed
            that there was no difference between the legal status of these gratuities and the
            outstanding contracts for yearly renewable term insurance. It used in respect to both
            classes of benevolences the substantially same phrase. It repealed "all public laws"
            relating to the several categories of gratuities; and it repealed "all laws granting or
            pertaining to" such insurance. No right to sue the United States on any of these
            gratuities had been granted in the several statutes conferring them; and the right to
            the gratuity might be withdrawn at any time. The dominant intention was obviously to
            abolish rights, not remedies.</p>
         <p>That Congress intended to take away the right under outstanding yearly renewable term
            policies, and was not concerned with the consent to sue the United States thereon,
            appears also from the saving clauses in § 17. These provide that "all allowed claims
            under the above referred to laws" are to be reviewed and the benefits are to be paid
            "where a person is found entitled under this Act"; and that "nothing contained in this
            section shall interfere with payments to be made under contracts of yearly renewable
            term insurance under which payments have commenced, or on any judgment heretofore
            rendered in a court of competent jurisdiction in any suit on a contract of yearly
            renewable term insurance, or which may hereafter be rendered in any such suit now
            pending." <span class="star-pagination">*586</span> That is, the rights under certain
            yearly renewable term policies are excepted from the general repealing clause.<span
               class="sup">[17]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Fifth. There is a suggestion that although, in repealing all laws "granting or
            pertaining to yearly renewable term insurance," Congress intended to take away the
            contractual right, it also intended to take away the remedy; that since it had power to
            take away the remedy, the statute should be given effect to that extent, even if void
            insofar as it purported to take away the contractual right. The suggestion is at war
            with settled rules of construction. It is true that a statute bad in part is not
            necessarily void in its entirety. A provision within the legislative power may be
            allowed to stand if it is separable from the bad. But no provision however
            unobjectionable in itself, can stand unless it appears both that, standing alone, the
            provision can be given legal effect and that the legislature intended the
            unobjectionable provision to stand in case other provisions held bad should fall. Dorchy
            v. Kansas, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/vQz/dorchy-v-kansas/">
                  <span class="volume">264</span>
                  <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
                  <span class="page">286</span>
               </a>
            </span>, 288, 290. Here, both those essentials are absent. There is no separate
            provision in § 17 dealing with the remedy; and it does not appear that Congress wished
            to deny the remedy if the repeal of the contractual right was held void under the Fifth
            Amendment.</p>
         <p>War Risk Insurance and the war gratuities were enjoyed, in the main, by the same classes
            of persons; and were administered by the same governmental agency. In respect of both,
            Congress had theretofore expressed its benevolent purpose perhaps more generously than
            would have been warranted in 1933 by the financial condition of the Nation. When it
            became advisable to reduce the Nation's existing expenditures, the two classes of
            benevolences were associated in the minds of the legislators; and it was natural that
            they should have wished to subject <span class="star-pagination">*587</span> both to the
            same treatment. But it is not to be assumed that Congress would have resorted to the
            device of withdrawing the legal remedy from beneficiaries of outstanding yearly
            renewable term policies if it had realized that these had contractual rights. It is, at
            least, as probable that Congress overlooked the fundamental difference in legal
            incidents between the two classes of benevolences dealt with in § 17 as that it wished
            to evade payment of the Nation's legal obligations.</p>
         <p>Sixth. The judgments below appear to have been based, in the main, not on § 17 of the
            Economy Act, but on § 5 which provides:</p>
         <p>"All decisions rendered by the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs under the provisions
            of this title, or the regulations issued pursuant thereto, shall be final and conclusive
            on all questions of law and fact, and no other official or court of the United States
            shall have jurisdiction to review by mandamus or otherwise any such decision."</p>
         <p>This section, as the Solicitor General concedes, does not relate to War Risk Insurance.
            It concerns only grants to veterans and their dependents &#x97; pensions, compensation
            allowances and special privileges, all of which are gratuities. The purpose of the
            section appears to have been to remove the possibility of judicial relief in that class
            of cases even under the special circumstances suggested in Crouch v. United States, 266
            U.S. 180; Silberschein v. United States, 266 U.S. 221; United States v. Williams, 278
            U.S. 255; Smith v. United States, 57 F. (2d) 998. Compare United States v. Meadows, 281
            U.S. 271.</p>
         <p>Seventh. The Solicitor General concedes that in No. 861 no question is presented except
            that of jurisdiction dependent upon the construction of the clause in § 17 of the
            Economy Act discussed above. He contends in No. 855, that if jurisdiction is
            entertained, the demurrer <span class="star-pagination">*588</span> should be sustained
            on the ground that the complaint fails to set forth a good cause of action, since it
            fails to show that the suit was brought within the period allowed by law. This alleged
            defect was not pleaded or brought to the attention of either of the courts below. Nor
            was it brought by the Solicitor General to the attention of this Court when opposing the
            petition for a writ of certiorari. We do not pass upon that question, which like others
            relating to the merits, will be open for consideration by the lower courts upon the
            remand.</p>
         <p>Eighth. Mention should be made of legislation by Congress enacted since the commencement
            of these suits.</p>
         <p>1. Act of June 16, 1933, c. 101, § 20, 48 Stat. 309 provides:</p>
         <p>"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 17, title I, Public Numbered 2, Seventy-third
            Congress, any claim for yearly renewable term insurance on which premiums were paid to
            the date of death of the insured . . . under the provisions of laws repealed by said
            section 17 wherein claim was duly filed prior to March 20, 1933, may be adjudicated by
            the Veterans' Administration on the proofs and evidence received by Veterans'
            Administration prior to March 20, 1933, and any person found entitled to the benefits
            claimed shall be paid such benefits in accordance with and in the amounts provided by
            such prior laws. .. ."</p>
         <p>2. Section 35 of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1935, passed on March
            27-28, 1934, over the President's veto, provides:</p>
         <p>"That notwithstanding the provisions of section 17 of title I, of an Act entitled `An
            Act to maintain the Credit of the United States Government' approved March 20, 1933, and
            section 20 of an Act entitled `An Act making appropriations for the Executive offices,
            etc. . . .' approved June 16, 1933, any claim for yearly renewable term insurance under
            the provisions of laws repealed by said section 17, wherein claim was duly filed prior
            to <span class="star-pagination">*589</span> March 20, 1933, and on which maturity of
            the insurance contract had been determined by the Veterans' Administration prior to
            March 20, 1933, and where payments could not be made because of the provisions of the
            Act of March 20, 1933, or under the provisions of the Act of June 16, 1933, may be
            adjudicated by the Veterans' Administration and any person found entitled to yearly
            renewable term insurance benefits claimed shall be paid such benefits in accordance with
            and in the amounts provided by such prior laws."<span class="sup">[18]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The provision in the Act of June 16, 1933, which was enacted before the entry of
            judgments by the district courts, does not appear to have been considered by the lower
            courts. The provision in the Act of March 27-28, 1934, was enacted after the filing in
            this Court of the petitions for certiorari but before the writs were granted. As neither
            of these Acts was referred to by the Solicitor General or by counsel for the
            petitioners, we assume that there is nothing in them, or in any action taken thereunder,
            which should affect the disposition of the cases now before us. Any such matter also
            will be open for consideration by the lower courts upon the remand.</p>

            Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</p>
         <p>[2] Section 404 provides: "That during the period of war and thereafter until converted
            the insurance shall be term insurance for successive terms of one year each. Not later
            than five years after the date of the termination of the war as declared by proclamation
            of the President of the United States, the term insurance shall be converted, without
            medical examination, into such form or forms of insurance as may be prescribed by
            regulations and as the insured may request. Regulations shall provide for the right to
            convert into ordinary life, twenty payment life, endowment maturing at age sixty-two,
            and into other usual forms of insurance. . . ."</p>
         <p>[3] The disbursements to June 30, 1933, for term and automatic insurance (the latter
            provided for those who were permanently and totally disabled or who died within 120 days
            after entrance into the service and before making application for term insurance)
            exceeded the premium receipts by $1,166,939,057. Administrator of Veterans' Affairs,
            Report for Year 1933, p. 28. The annual cost of administration was estimated at
            $1,744,038.56. Report of United States Veterans' Bureau for 1922, p. 465. War Risk
            Insurance was devised in the hope that it would, in large measure, avoid the necessity
            of granting pensions. Term insurance was issued at a very low premium rate. Over
            4,684,000 persons applied before the armistice to the amount of about $40,000,000,000
            for War Risk term insurance; but over 75 per cent. of the men who carried term insurance
            while in the service never paid a premium after the war. See Report of Bureau of War
            Risk Insurance for 1920, pp. 5, 7, 41; Report of United States Veterans' Bureau for
