         </span> (1964) SEARS, ROEBUCK &amp;amp; CO. v. STIFFEL COMPANY. No. 108. <p>Supreme Court
            of United States.</p> Argued January 16, 1964. Decided March 9, 1964. CERTIORARI TO THE
         UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT. <p>Will Freeman argued the cause
            for petitioner. With him on the briefs were Frank H. Marks, D. D. Allegretti and George
            B. Newitt.</p>
         <p>Warren C. Horton argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Max R.
            Kraus.</p>
         <p>Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Orrick, Daniel M. Friedman and Lionel
            Kestenbaum filed a brief for the United States, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.</p>
         <p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
         <p>The question in this case is whether a State's unfair competition law can, consistently
            with the federal patent laws, impose liability for or prohibit the copying of an article
            which is protected by neither a federal patent nor a copyright. The respondent, Stiffel
            Company, secured design and mechanical patents on a "pole lamp"&#x97; a vertical <span
               class="star-pagination">*226</span> tube having lamp fixtures along the outside, the
            tube being made so that it will stand upright between the floor and ceiling of a room.
            Pole lamps proved a decided commercial success, and soon after Stiffel brought them on
            the market Sears, Roebuck &amp;amp; Company put on the market a substantially identical
            lamp, which it sold more cheaply, Sears' retail price being about the same as Stiffel's
            wholesale price. Stiffel then brought this action against Sears in the United States
            District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, claiming in its first count that
            by copying its design Sears had infringed Stiffel's patents and in its second count that
            by selling copies of Stiffel's lamp Sears had caused confusion in the trade as to the
            source of the lamps and had thereby engaged in unfair competition under Illinois law.
            There was evidence that identifying tags were not attached to the Sears lamps although
            labels appeared on the cartons in which they were delivered to customers, that customers
            had asked Stiffel whether its lamps differed from Sears', and that in two cases
            customers who had bought Stiffel lamps had complained to Stiffel on learning that Sears
            was selling substantially identical lamps at a much lower price.</p>
         <p>The District Court, after holding the patents invalid for want of invention, went on to
            find as a fact that Sears' lamp was "a substantially exact copy" of Stiffel's and that
            the two lamps were so much alike, both in appearance and in functional details, "that
            confusion between them is likely, and some confusion has already occurred." On these
            findings the court held Sears guilty of unfair competition, enjoined Sears "from
            unfairly competing with [Stiffel] by selling or attempting to sell pole lamps identical
            to or confusingly similar to" Stiffel's lamp, and ordered an accounting to fix profits
            and damages resulting from Sears' "unfair competition."</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*227</span> The Court of Appeals affirmed.<span
               class="sup">[1]</span> 313 F. 2d 115. That court held that, to make out a case of
            unfair competition under Illinois law, there was no need to show that Sears had been
            "palming off" its lamps as Stiffel lamps; Stiffel had only to prove that there was a
            "likelihood of confusion as to the source of the products"&#x97;that the two articles
            were sufficiently identical that customers could not tell who had made a particular one.
            Impressed by the "remarkable sameness of appearance" of the lamps, the Court of Appeals
            upheld the trial court's findings of likelihood of confusion and some actual confusion,
            findings which the appellate court construed to mean confusion "as to the source of the
            lamps." The Court of Appeals thought this enough under Illinois law to sustain the trial
            court's holding of unfair competition, and thus held Sears liable under Illinois law for
            doing no more than copying and marketing an unpatented article.<span class="sup"
               >[2]</span> We granted certiorari to consider whether this <span
               class="star-pagination">*228</span> use of a State's law of unfair competition is
            compatible with the federal patent law. 374 U. S. 826.</p>
         <p>Before the Constitution was adopted, some States had granted patents either by special
            act or by general statute,<span class="sup">[3]</span> but when the Constitution was
            adopted provision for a federal patent law was made one of the enumerated powers of
            Congress because, as Madison put it in The <ref type="treatise" num="43">Federalist</ref> No. 43, the States "cannot
            separately make effectual provision" for either patents or copyrights.<span class="sup"
               >[4]</span> That constitutional provision is Art. I, § 8, cl. 8, which empowers
            Congress "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited
            Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and
            Discoveries." Pursuant to this constitutional <span class="star-pagination">*229</span>
            authority, Congress in 1790 enacted the first federal patent and copyright law, 1 Stat.
            109, and ever since that time has fixed the conditions upon which patents and copyrights
            shall be granted, see 17 U. S. C. §§ 1-216; 35 U. S. C. §§ 1-293. These laws, like other
            laws of the United States enacted pursuant to constitutional authority, are the supreme
            law of the land. See Sperry v. Florida, 373 U. S. 379 (1963). When state law touches
            upon the area of these federal statutes, it is "familiar doctrine" that the federal
            policy "may not be set at naught, or its benefits denied" by the state law. Sola Elec.
            Co. v. Jefferson Elec. Co., 317 U. S. 173, 176 (1942). This is true, of course, even if
            the state law is enacted in the exercise of otherwise undoubted state power.</p>
         <p>The grant of a patent is the grant of a statutory monopoly;<span class="sup">[5]</span>
            indeed, the grant of patents in England was an explicit exception to the statute of
            James I prohibiting monopolies.<span class="sup">[6]</span> Patents are not given as
            favors, as was the case of monopolies given by the Tudor monarchs, see The Case of
            Monopolies (Darcy v. Allein), 11 Co. Rep. 84 b., 77 Eng. Rep. 1260 (K. B. 1602), but are
            meant to encourage invention by rewarding the inventor with the right, limited to a term
            of years fixed by the patent, to exclude others from the use of his invention. During
            that period of time no one may make, use, or sell the patented <span
               class="star-pagination">*230</span> product without the patentee's authority. 35 U.
            S. C. § 271. But in rewarding useful invention, the "rights and welfare of the community
            must be fairly dealt with and effectually guarded." Kendall v. Winsor, <span
               class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/rVM/kendall-v-winsor/">

               </a>
            </span>, 329 (1859). To that end the prerequisites to obtaining a patent are strictly
            observed, and when the patent has issued the limitations on its exercise are equally
            strictly enforced. To begin with, a genuine "invention" or "discovery" must be
            demonstrated "lest in the constant demand for new appliances the heavy hand of tribute
            be laid on each slight technological advance in an art." Cuno Engineering Corp. v.
            Automatic Devices Corp., 314 U. S. 84, 92 (1941); see Great Atlantic &amp;amp; Pacific
            Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U. S. 147, 152-153 (1950); Atlantic Works v.
            Brady, 107 U. S. 192, 199-200 (1883). Once the patent issues, it is strictly construed,
            United States v. Masonite Corp., 316 U. S. 265, 280 (1942), it cannot be used to secure
            any monopoly beyond that contained in the patent, Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co.,
            314 U. S. 488, 492 (1942), the patentee's control over the product when it leaves his
            hands is sharply limited, see United States v. Univis Lens Co., 316 U. S. 241, 250-252
            (1942), and the patent monopoly may not be used in disregard of the antitrust laws, see
            International Business Machines Corp. v. United States, 298 U. S. 131 (1936); United
            Shoe Machinery Corp. v. United States, 258 U. S. 451, 463-464 (1922). Finally, and
            especially relevant here, when the patent expires the monopoly created by it expires,
            too, and the right to make the article&#x97;including the right to make it in precisely
            the shape it carried when patented&#x97;passes to the public. Kellogg Co. v. National
            Biscuit Co., 305 U. S. 111, 120-122 (1938); Singer Mfg. Co. v. June Mfg. Co., 163 U. S.
            169, 185 (1896).</p>
         <p>Thus the patent system is one in which uniform federal standards are carefully used to
            promote invention <span class="star-pagination">*231</span> while at the same time
            preserving free competition.<span class="sup">[7]</span> Obviously a State could not,
            consistently with the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution,<span class="sup">[8]</span>
            extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date or give a patent on an article
            which lacked the level of invention required for federal patents. To do either would run
            counter to the policy of Congress of granting patents only to true inventions, and then
            only for a limited time. Just as a State cannot encroach upon the federal patent laws
            directly, it cannot, under some other law, such as that forbidding unfair competition,
            give protection of a kind that clashes with the objectives of the federal patent
            laws.</p>
         <p>In the present case the "pole lamp" sold by Stiffel has been held not to be entitled to
            the protection of either a mechanical or a design patent. An unpatentable article, like
            an article on which the patent has expired, is in the public domain and may be made and
            sold by whoever chooses to do so. What Sears did was to copy Stiffel's design and to
            sell lamps almost identical to those sold by Stiffel. This it had every right to do
            under the federal patent laws. That Stiffel originated the pole lamp and made it popular
            is immaterial. "Sharing in the goodwill of an article unprotected by patent or
            trade-mark is the exercise of a right possessed by all&#x97;and in the free exercise of
            which the consuming public is deeply interested." Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co.,
            supra, 305 U. S., at 122. To allow a State by use of its law of unfair competition to
            prevent the copying of an article which represents <span class="star-pagination"
               >*232</span> too slight an advance to be patented would be to permit the State to
            block off from the public something which federal law has said belongs to the public.
            The result would be that while federal law grants only 14 or 17 years' protection to
            genuine inventions, see 35 U. S. C. §§ 154, 173, States could allow perpetual protection
            to articles too lacking in novelty to merit any patent at all under federal
            constitutional standards. This would be too great an encroachment on the federal patent
            system to be tolerated.</p>
         <p>Sears has been held liable here for unfair competition because of a finding of
            likelihood of confusion based only on the fact that Sears' lamp was copied from
            Stiffel's unpatented lamp and that consequently the two looked exactly alike. Of course
            there could be "confusion" as to who had manufactured these nearly identical articles.
            But mere inability of the public to tell two identical articles apart is not enough to
            support an injunction against copying or an award of damages for copying that which the
            federal patent laws permit to be copied. Doubtless a State may, in appropriate
            circumstances, require that goods, whether patented or unpatented, be labeled or that
            other precautionary steps be taken to prevent customers from being misled as to the
            source, just as it may protect businesses in the use of their trademarks, labels, or
            distinctive dress in the packaging of goods so as to prevent others, by imitating such
            markings, from misleading purchasers as to the source of the goods.<span class="sup"
               >[9]</span> But because of the federal patent laws a State may not, when the article
            is unpatented and uncopyrighted, prohibit the <span class="star-pagination">*233</span>
            copying of the article itself or award damages for such copying. Cf. G. Ricordi
            &amp;amp; Co. v. Haendler, 194 F. 2d 914, 916 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1952). The judgment below
            did both and in so doing gave Stiffel the equivalent of a patent monopoly on its
            unpatented lamp. That was error, and Sears is entitled to a judgment in its favor.</p>

         <p>[1] No review is sought here of the ruling affirming the District Court's holding that

         <p>[2] 313 F. 2d, at 118 and nn. 6, 7. At least one Illinois case has held in an exhaustive
            opinion that unfair competition under the law of Illinois is not proved unless the
            defendant is shown to have "palmed off" the article which he sells-as that of another
            seller; the court there said that "[t]he courts in this State do not treat the `palming
            off' doctrine as merely the designation of a typical class of cases of unfair
            competition, but they announce it as the rule of law itself&#x97;the test by which it is
            determined whether a given state of facts constitutes unfair competition as a matter of
            law. . . . The `palming off' rule is expressed in a positive, concrete form which will
            not admit of `broadening' or `widening' by any proper judicial process." Stevens-Davis

            </span>, 65-66 (1923). In spite of this the Court of Appeals in its opinions both in
            this case and in Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., v. Compco Corp., 311 F. 2d 26, rev'd, post,
            p. 234, relied upon one of its previous decisions in a trade-name case, Independent Nail
            &amp;amp; Packing Co. v. Stronghold Screw Products, 205 F. 2d 921 (C. A. 7th Cir. 1953),
            which concluded that as to use of trade names the Stevens-Davis rule had been overruled
            by two subsequent Illinois decisions. Those two cases, however, discussed only
            misleading use of trade names, not copying of articles of trade. One prohibited the use
            of a name so similar to that of another seller as to deceive or confuse customers, even
            though the defendant company did not sell the same products as the plaintiff and so in
            one sense could not be said to have palmed off its goods as those of a competitor, since
            the plaintiff was not a competitor. Lady Esther, Ltd., v. Lady Esther Corset Shoppe,
            Inc., <span class="citation no-link">

            </span>, 46 N. E. 2d 165 (1943). The other Illinois case on which the Court of Appeals
            relied was a mandamus action which held that under an Illinois statute a corporation was
            properly denied registration in the State when its name was "deceptively similar" to
            that of a corporation already registered. Investors Syndicate of America, Inc., v.
            Hughes, <span class="citation no-link">

               <span class="page">413</span>
            </span>, 38 N. E. 2d 754 (1941). The Court of Appeals, by holding that because Illinois
            forbids misleading use of trade names it also forbids as unfair competition the mere
            copying of an article of trade without any palming off, thus appears to have extended
            greatly the scope of the Illinois law of unfair competition beyond the limits indicated
            in the Illinois cases and beyond any previous decisions of the Seventh Circuit itself.
            Because of our disposition of these cases we need not decide whether it was correct in
            doing so.</p>

            excepted patents of 14 years to "the true and first Inventor and Inventors" of "new

            be inferred from such statutes as that which vests exclusive jurisdiction to hear patent
            and copyright cases in federal courts, 28 U. S. C. § 1338 (a), and that section of the
