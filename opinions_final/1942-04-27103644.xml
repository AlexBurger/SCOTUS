         <p>The effect of § 6 of the Federal Employers' Liability Act<span class="sup">[1]</span> on
            the power of a state court to enjoin its citizens, on the ground of oppressiveness and
            inequity to the defendant carrier, from suing on a F.E.L.A. claim in the state courts of
            another state, furthering such a suit in any manner, or receiving the proceeds of any
            judgment so obtained, is before us for decision.</p>
         <p>The respondent, an Illinois corporation, hereafter referred to as the Illinois Central,
            brought an original bill in the Chancery Court of Shelby County, Tennessee, seeking to
            enjoin one of the petitioners here, Mrs. Miles, then the Tennessee administratrix of her
            husband, a resident of that State, from further prosecuting in a Missouri state court
            her F.E.L.A. claim against the Illinois Central for the death of her husband, its
            employee. The fatal accident had occurred at Memphis, Tennessee. After a temporary
            injunction issued, Mrs. Miles promptly dismissed her Missouri suit and was discharged as
            administratrix by <span class="star-pagination">*700</span> the Tennessee probate court.
            A Missouri administrator was then appointed at her suggestion, and he instituted another
            Missouri suit for the same cause of action. The Illinois Central filed an amended and
            supplemental bill, adding decedent's children, likewise residents of Tennessee, as
            defendants, and enlarging its prayer to forbid furthering the new suit in any manner or
            receiving the proceeds of any judgment. A new temporary injunction was issued as
            prayed.</p>
         <p>The grounds for the injunction were the inconvenience and expense to the Illinois
            Central of taking its Memphis employees to St. Louis, and the resulting burden upon
            interstate commerce. The anticipated extra expense was several hundred dollars per day
            for an estimated two days of actual trial and whatever additional time might be lost by
            continuances or delay. Inconvenience was expected through the withdrawal of some twelve
            to twenty employees and officials from their duties for the same period. The defense
            relied upon a timely plea that § 6 of the F.E.L.A. prevented the enjoining of
            proceedings in the Missouri courts.</p>
         <p>The trial court found that the continued prosecution of the pending Missouri case would
            be "oppressive and inequitable" to the Illinois Central and "a burden on the commerce
            and business of the complainant." As a matter of law, the court concluded, however, that
            the Illinois Central was not entitled to permanent injunctions. On appeal the Court of
            Appeals reversed the decree and made the temporary injunctions permanent. Further state
            review by certiorari in the Supreme Court of Tennessee was refused, and we granted
            certiorari to the Court of Appeals to settle an important federal question<span
               class="sup">[2]</span> as to the applicability <span class="star-pagination"

         <p>The Kepner case dealt with the power of a state court to enjoin a resident from
            continued prosecution of a suit under the F.E.L.A. in a distant federal district court
            on the ground of inequity, vexatiousness and harassment. The decision denied the power
            to interfere with the privileges of federal venue "for the benefit of the carrier or the
            national transportation system."</p>
         <p>As in the Kepner case, there is in this case no occasion to go into the question of the
            availability, as support for an injunction, of a charge of interference with interstate
            commerce by reason of the burden of expense and inconvenience. The trial court found a
            burden on the commerce of the Illinois Central, but made no finding as to any burden on
            interstate commerce. Moreover, the Court of Appeals stated that the Illinois Central
            "expressly abandoned the contention" "that the prosecution of the suit in St. Louis was
            a burden on interstate commerce." No contention is made here that there is any such
            burden or that the Illinois Central is not doing substantial business in Missouri, as
            found by the trial court. It operates daily passenger trains with its own crews into St.
            Louis over the St. Louis Terminal Company tracks, maintains passenger and freight
            offices and had total receipts, in St. Louis, of a million-and-a-half the year the suit
            was filed. Under the rule announced in Denver &amp;amp; R.G.W.R. Co. v. Terte, <span

            </span>, 287, the Illinois Central is properly suable in Missouri. In the Kepner case,
               <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/wMk/baltimore-ohio-r-co-v-kepner/">
                  <span class="volume">314</span>
                  <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>

               </a>
            </span>, 51, we pointed out, with a discussion of the applicable cases, that the carrier
            must submit to inconvenience and expense, if there is jurisdiction, "although thereby
            interstate commerce is incidentally <span class="star-pagination">*702</span> burdened."
            There is no occasion to repeat the comments here. The specific declaration in § 6 that
            the United States courts should have concurrent jurisdiction with those of the several
            states, and the prohibition against removal, point clearly to the conclusion that
            Congress has exercised its authority over interstate commerce to the extent of
            permitting suits in state courts, despite the incidental burden, where process may be
            obtained on a defendant, not merely soliciting business but actually carrying on
            railroading by operating trains and maintaining traffic offices within the territory of
            the court's jurisdiction.<span class="sup">[3]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The real point of controversy here is whether that portion of § 6 of the F.E.L.A., which
            holds litigation in the state court where it is instituted, prevents the court of
            another state from enjoining citizens, within its jurisdiction, from continued
            prosecution of the suit on grounds of inequity. Here, as in Kepner's case, there is no
            question but that the Missouri court has venue of the proceeding. Here, too, we need to
            look no farther into Tennessee law than the opinion of the state's highest court, in
            this record, to conclude that under state law a court of equity may enjoin a resident
            citizen from attempting to enforce his rights, oppressively and inequitably,<span
               class="sup">[4]</span> and that the expense and inconvenience hereinbefore set out
            resulted in oppressiveness and inconvenience in the eye of the state court.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*703</span> In the legislative history of § 6,<span
               class="sup">[5]</span> the provision that removal may not be had from a "state court
            of competent jurisdiction" was added to the House bill on the floor of the Senate and
            later accepted by the House, in order to assure a hearing to the employee in a state
            court. Words were simultaneously adopted recognizing the jurisdiction of the state
            courts by providing that the federal jurisdiction should be concurrent. The venue of
            state court suits was left to the practice of the forum. The opportunity to present
            causes of action arising under the F.E.L.A. in the state courts came, however, not from
            the state law but from the federal. By virtue of the Constitution, the courts of the
            several states must remain open to such litigants on the same basis that they are open
            to litigants with causes of action springing from a different source. This is so because
            the Federal Constitution makes the laws of the United States the supreme law of <span
               class="star-pagination">*704</span> the land, binding on every citizen and every
            court and enforceable wherever jurisdiction is adequate for the purpose. Second

            </span>, 56-59. The Missouri court here involved must permit this litigation. To deny
            citizens from other states, suitors under F.E.L.A., access to its courts would, if it
            permitted access to its own citizens, violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause.

               </a>
            </span>, 233.<span class="sup">[6]</span> Since the existence of the cause of action and
            the privilege of vindicating rights under the F.E.L.A. in state courts spring from
            federal law, the right to sue in state courts of proper venue where their jurisdiction
            is adequate is of the same quality as the right to sue in federal courts. It is no more
            subject to interference by state action than was the federal venue in the Kepner
            case.</p>
         <p>This is not to say that states cannot control their courts. We do not deal here with the
            power of Missouri by judicial decision or legislative enactment to regulate the use of
            its courts generally, as was approved in the Douglas or the Chambers cases, note 6
            supra. We are considering another state's power to so control its own citizens that they
            cannot exercise the federal privilege of litigating a federal right in the court of
            another state.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*705</span> State courts have assumed the right to enjoin
            their citizens from proceeding in the courts of other states. This was done, for
            example, in Reed's Admrx. v. Illinois Central R. Co., <span class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">182</span>

               <span class="page">455</span>
            </span>, 206 S.W. 794. The basis of the decision was the inequity of allowing a suit at
            a distant point in a state or federal court, Page 464.<span class="sup">[7]</span>Reed's
            case was relied upon by Kern v. Cleveland, C., C. &amp;amp; St. L. Ry. Co., <span

            </span>, for the authority of a state court to enjoin its citizens from inequitable
            conduct under the F.E.L.A. Other state courts deny their authority to issue such
               injunctions.<span class="sup">[8]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The permission granted by Congress to sue in state courts may be exercised only where
            the carrier is found doing business. If suits in federal district courts at those points
            do not unduly burden interstate commerce, suits in similarly located state courts cannot
            be burdensome. As Congress has permitted both the state and federal suits, its
            determination that the carriers must bear the incidental burden is a determination that
            the state courts may not treat the normal expense and inconvenience of trial in
            permitted places, such as the one selected here, as inequitable and unconscionable.</p>
         <p>The judgment below is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Court of Appeals of
            Tennessee for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>
         <p>Reversed.</p>
         <p>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON, concurring:</p>
         <p>I agree with the conclusion and, with exceptions stated herein, with the opinion of MR.
            JUSTICE REED, though I <span class="star-pagination">*706</span> am not able to
            sublimate the conflict that underlies this case to the level of either of the
            conflicting opinions. Realistically considered, the issue is earthy and unprincipled. So
            viewed, the real issue is whether a plaintiff with a cause of action under the Federal
            Employers' Liability Act may go shopping for a judge or a jury believed to be more
            favorable than he would find in his home forum. An advantage which it is hoped will be
            reflected in a judgment is what makes plaintiffs leave home and incur burdens of expense
            and inconvenience that would be regarded as oppressive if forced upon them. And that is
            what makes railroads seek injunctions such as this one.</p>
         <p>The judiciary has never favored this sort of shopping for a forum. It has sought to
            protect its own good name as well as to protect defendants by injunctions against the
            practice of seeking out soft spots in the judicial system in which to bring particular
            kinds of litigation. But the judges, with lawyerly indirection, have not avowed the
            interest of the judiciary in orderly resort to the courts as a basis for their decision,
            and have cast their protective doctrines in terms of sheltering defendants against
            vexatious and harassing suits. This judicial treatment of the subject of venue leads
            Congress and the parties to think of the choice of a forum as a private matter between
            litigants, and in cases like the present obscures the public interest in venue practices
            behind a rather fantastic fiction that a widow is harassing the Illinois Central
            Railroad. If Congress had left us free to consult the ultimate public interest in
            orderly resort to the judicial system, I should agree with MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER'S
            conclusion. But the plaintiffs say that they go shopping, not by leave of the courts
            themselves, but by the authority of Congress. Whether the Congress has granted such
            latitude is our question.</p>
         <p>Unless there is some hidden meaning in the language Congress has employed, the injured
            workman or his surviving <span class="star-pagination">*707</span> dependents may choose
            from the entire territory served by the railroad any place in which to sue, and in which
            to choose either a federal or a state court of which to ask his remedy. There is nothing
            which requires a plaintiff to whom such a choice is given to exercise it in a
            self-denying or large-hearted manner. There is nothing to restrain use of that
            privilege, as all choices of tribunal are commonly used by all plaintiffs to get away
            from judges who are considered to be unsympathetic, and to get before those who are
            considered more favorable; to get away from juries thought to be small-minded in the
            matter of verdicts, and to get to those thought to be generous; to escape courts whose
            procedures are burdensome to the plaintiff, and to seek out courts whose procedures make
            the going easy.</p>
         <p>That such a privilege puts a burden on interstate commerce may well be admitted, but
            Congress has the power to burden. The Federal Employers' Liability Act itself leaves
            interstate commerce under the burden of a medieval system of compensating the injured
            railroad worker or his survivors. He is not given a remedy, but only a lawsuit. It is
            well understood that in most cases he will be unable to pursue that except by splitting
            his speculative prospects with a lawyer. The functioning of this backward system of
            dealing with industrial accidents in interstate commerce burdens it with perhaps two
            dollars of judgment for every dollar that actually reaches those who have been damaged,
            and it leaves the burden of many injuries to be borne by them utterly uncompensated.
            Such being the major burden under which the workmen and the industry must function, I
            see no reason to believe that Congress could not have intended the relatively minor
            additional burden to interstate commerce from loading the dice a little in favor of the
            workman in the matter of venue. It seems more probable that Congress intended to give
            the disadvantaged workman some leverage in <span class="star-pagination">*708</span> the
            choice of venue, than that it intended to leave him in a position where the railroad
            could force him to try one lawsuit at home to find out whether he would be allowed to
            try his principal lawsuit elsewhere. This latter would be a frequent result if we upheld
            the contention made in this case and in the Kepner case. I think, therefore, that the
            petitioner had a right to resort to the Missouri court under the circumstances of this
            case for her remedy.</p>
         <p>I do not, however, agree with the statement in MR. JUSTICE REED'S opinion that "the
            Missouri court here involved must permit this litigation." It is very doubtful if any
            requirement can be spelled out of the Federal Constitution that a state must furnish a
            forum for a nonresident plaintiff and a foreign corporation to fight out issues imported
            from another state where the cause of action arose. It seems unnecessary to decide now
            whether this litigation could be imposed on the Missouri court, for it appears to have
            embraced the litigation. Even if Missouri, by reason of its control of its own courts
            might refuse to open them to such a case, it does not follow that another state may
            close Missouri's courts to one with a federal cause of action. If Missouri elects to
            entertain the case, the courts of no other state can obstruct or prevent its exercise of
            jurisdiction as conferred by the federal statute or its right to obtain evidence and to
            distribute the proceeds, if any, in accordance with the Federal Employers' Liability
            Act. I therefore favor reversal.</p></div>

         <p>For a decision so far-reaching in its implications, warrant is found in the inarticulate
            radiations of § 6 of the 1910 amendment to the Federal Employers' Liability Act. While
            the words of a statute do not by themselves distil its meaning, we must at least begin
            with them. The language of § 6 is simple and direct. After establishing a two-year
            period of limitations, it continues: "Under this Act an action may be brought in a
            circuit court of the United States, in the district of the residence of the defendant,
            or in which the cause of action arose, or in which the defendant shall be doing business
            at the time of commencing such action. The jurisdiction of the courts of the United
            States under this Act shall be concurrent with that of the courts of the several States,
            and no case arising under this Act and brought in any state court of competent
            jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the United States." 36 Stat. 291.</p>
         <p>This is a conventional provision. There is nothing novel or distinctive about it.
            Recognition of concurrent jurisdiction in the state courts to vindicate federal rights
            is found in the first Judiciary Act of 1789. 1 Stat. 73, 77. <span
               class="star-pagination">*710</span> And the statute books are replete with instances
            in which Congress has acknowledged the existence of this jurisdiction in the state
            courts unless explicitly withheld from them. See the discussion of Mr. Justice Bradley
            in Claflin v. Houseman, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/syA/claflin-v-houseman/">

               </a>
            </span>, 139-43. The essence of § 6 is merely that the state courts are open to a
            plaintiff suing under the Act, and that if he chooses to bring suit in a state court,
            the defendant may not remove the cause to a federal court. So far as language conveys
            ideas, the Act affords no intimation that Congress intended anything more.</p>

            Historically, the problem of interferences, direct or indirect, between federal and
            state courts is entirely separate from the problem of the relations of the state courts
            to each other. See Warren, Federal and State Court Interference, 43 Harv. L. Rev. 345.
            The question now before us &#x97; relating to the power of a state to enjoin those
            subject to its jurisdiction from unjustly resorting to the courts of a sister state
            &#x97; is an aspect of the latter problem. In the Kepner case, this Court held only that
            the provision of § 6 "filled the entire field of venue in federal courts" and that what
            had thus been legislatively given to the federal courts could not judicially be taken
            away. The Kepner decision cast no cloud upon Douglas v. New York, N.H. &amp;amp; H.R.
            Co., <span class="citation">

            </span>, which sustained the power of a state to apply the principle of forum non
            conveniens to suits under the Act brought in its courts by non-residents. The issue in
            the case at bar is essentially another phase of the problem in the Douglas case &#x97;
            whether merely by authorizing access to the state courts to enforce rights created by
            the Federal Employers' Liability Act, Congress impliedly repealed pro tanto the means
            for <span class="star-pagination">*711</span> achieving justice which the states
            customarily employ in similar cases. Specifically, the question for decision is this:
            Has Congress, by providing explicitly that state courts shall have concurrent
            jurisdiction of suits under the Act, withdrawn from each state its recognized power to
            enjoin persons within its jurisdiction from bringing a suit under the Act "contrary to
            equity and good conscience" in the courts of another state? This question was wholly
            outside the scope of the Kepner case. It was not presented, and was therefore not
            decided, by that case.</p>
         <p>The relevant circumstances here are these. A resident of Tennessee was killed in a
            railroad accident occurring in Tennessee. The railroad, an Illinois corporation, has its
            principal offices in Tennessee. All of the witnesses reside in Tennessee, as do the
            deceased's legal representatives. But suit was brought in a state court of Missouri,
            where the railroad does some business. Finding that the Missouri suit was "oppressive
            and inequitable," the Tennessee Court of Appeals sustained the power of the chancellor
            to restrain the further prosecution of that suit. The finding that the Missouri suit was
            "oppressive and inequitable" was challenged by the petitioners neither before us nor in
            the courts of Tennessee, and the propriety of the action taken by the Tennessee court,
            as a matter of equitable discretion, is not here in issue. We are called upon to decide
            only whether Congress has deprived Tennessee of the power which it has asserted in this
            case.</p>
         <p>It is admitted that the courts of Tennessee customarily exercise this power in
            situations like the present case. See American Express Co. v. Fox, <span
               class="citation no-link">

            </span>, 187 S.W. 1117. If the accident here had occurred while the deceased was engaged
            in intrastate commerce, and consequently had not given rise to a right of action under
            the federal statute, Tennessee would unquestionably have <span class="star-pagination"
               >*712</span> had the power to do what she has done here. For while the Privileges and
            Immunities Clause, Art. IV, § 2, secures to citizens of other states such right of
            access to the courts of a state as that state gives to its own citizens, Chambers v.

            </span>. Moreover, the Constitution would not prevent Missouri from declining to
            entertain a suit to vindicate a federal right, such as was brought here, if an action to
            enforce a similar non-federal right would also not lie in her courts. The availability
            of state courts for the enforcement of federal rights has not resulted in putting
            federal rights on any different footing from state rights. "A state may not discriminate
            against rights arising under federal laws," McKnett v. St. Louis &amp;amp; S.F. Ry. Co.,
            supra, at 234, but neither the Constitution nor Congress has compelled the states to
            discriminate in favor of federal rights. And this Court has expressly held that the
            rights created by the Federal Employers' Liability Act are not different, in this
            respect, from other federal rights. "As to the grant of jurisdiction in the Employers'
            Liability Act, that statute does not purport to require State Courts to entertain suits
            arising under it, but only to empower them to do so, so far as the authority of the
            United States is concerned." Douglas v. New York, N.H. &amp;amp; H.R. Co., supra, at
            387.</p>
         <p>The utilization of state courts for the vindication of federal rights does not require
            that their established procedures be remodeled or that their customary modes for
            administering justice be restricted. "And it was of course presumably an appreciation of
            the principles so thoroughly settled which caused Congress in the enactment of the
            Employers' Liability Act to clearly contemplate the <span class="star-pagination"
               >*713</span> existence of a concurrent power and duty of both Federal and state
            courts to administer the rights conferred by the statute in accordance with the modes of
            procedure prevailing in such courts." Minneapolis &amp;amp; St. Louis R. Co. v.

            </span>, 56. The mere fact that a federal right is the basis of suit cannot therefore
            deprive the state courts of the power to use their customary procedures for the
            achievement of justice. In simply taking advantage of the facilities afforded by the
            courts of the states, Congress cannot be deemed to have altered the settled
            jurisprudence of the states so as to operate more favorably for federal rights than for
            similar rights created by the states themselves. Such drastic inroads upon the authority
            of the states should be made only upon clear Congressional mandate.</p>
         <p>The Court finds such a plain command in the Act because Congress has explicitly provided
            in § 6 that the jurisdiction of the state courts "shall be concurrent" with that of the
            federal courts. But Congress thereby merely spelt out what has always been unquestioned
            constitutional doctrine. "It is a general rule that the grant of jurisdiction to one
            court does not, of itself, imply that the jurisdiction is to be exclusive. . . . Upon
            the state courts, equally with the courts of the Union, rests the obligation to guard
            and enforce every right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States

            </span>, 476, the Court reaffirmed the doctrine that "the state and federal courts have
            concurrent jurisdiction of suits of a civil nature arising under the Constitution and
            laws of the United <span class="star-pagination">*714</span> States, save in exceptional
            instances where the jurisdiction has been restricted by Congress to the federal courts."
            The source of these formulations is Hamilton's classic statement in No. 82 of the
            <ref type="treatise" num="82">Federalist</ref> (sesquicentennial ed., p. 536):</p>
         <p>"I hold that the State courts will be divested of no part of their primitive
            jurisdiction, further than may relate to an appeal; and I am even of opinion that in
            every case in which they were not expressly excluded by the future acts of the national
            legislature, they will of course take cognizance of the causes to which those acts may
            give birth. This I infer from the nature of judiciary power, and from the general genius
            of the system. The judiciary power of every government looks beyond its own local or
            municipal laws, and in civil cases lays hold of all subjects of litigation between
            parties within its jurisdiction, though the causes of dispute are relative to the laws
            of the most distant part of the globe. . . . When in addition to this we consider the
            State governments and the national governments, as they truly are, in the light of
            kindred systems, and as parts of ONE WHOLE, the inference seems to be conclusive, that
            the State courts would have a concurrent jurisdiction in all cases arising under the
            laws of the Union, where it was not expressly prohibited."</p>
         <p>Therefore, if Congress had been silent with respect to the jurisdiction of state courts
            of suits arising under the Act, the state courts would still have had such jurisdiction.
            If it be suggested that by articulating what would otherwise have been implied, Congress
            must have had some purpose, some interest of emphasis, it would be enough to say that
            such punctiliousness, and perhaps redundancy, of phrasing is not uncommon in procedural
            legislation. But, in any event, the legislative history of the 1910 amendment
            conclusively shows that Congress did not insert this <span class="star-pagination"
               >*715</span> provision in order to cut down the normal powers of state courts. The
            concurrent jurisdiction of the state courts was explicitly defined in order to dissipate
            an unwarranted doubt as to the right and duty of state courts to entertain suits arising
            under the Act. Congress wanted to avoid an implication of denial to the state courts of
            power to entertain cases under the Act, and not to create an implication of denial to
            the state courts of their traditional powers in dealing with such cases.</p>
         <p>The Act of 1908 contained no provision specifically dealing with venue. 35 Stat. 65. On
            January 7, 1910, Representative Sterling introduced a bill, H.R. 17263, that eventually
            became the 1910 amendment to the Act. The bill had this provision: "This Act shall not
            be construed as excluding the exercise of a concurrent jurisdiction of cases arising
            under the Act by the courts of the several States." The House Committee on the Judiciary
            reporting on the bill explained its purpose:</p>
         <p>"It is proposed to further amend the act by making the jurisdiction of the courts of the
            United States `concurrent with the courts of the several States.'</p>
         <p>"This is proposed in order that there shall be no excuse for courts of the States to
            follow in the error of . . . Hoxie v. N.Y., N.H. &amp;amp; H.R.R. Co. [82 Conn. 352] (73
            Atlantic Rep., 754) in which the court declined jurisdiction upon the ground, inter
            alia, that Congress did not intend that jurisdiction of cases arising under the act
            should be assumed by state courts.</p>
         <p>"It is clear under the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, that this
            conclusion of the Connecticut court is erroneous. And the reasons recited by the
            Connecticut court lead to an opposite conclusion from that which the opinion declares
            upon the subject. But no harm can come, and much injustice and wrong to suitors may be
            prevented by an express declaration that <span class="star-pagination">*716</span> there
            is no intent on the part of Congress to confine remedial actions brought under the
            employers' liability act to the courts of the United States." H. Rep. No. 513, 61st
            Cong., 2d Sess., p. 7.</p>
         <p>The Committee also recommended that the wording of the provision be changed to read as
            follows: "The jurisdiction of the courts of the United States under this act shall be
            concurrent with that of the courts of the several States." This language was embodied in
            the Act.</p>
         <p>When the bill came to the floor of the House, Representative Sterling, who was in charge
            of the measure, underscored the sole reason for the provision:</p>
         <p>"The second change in the law provides that the federal courts and the state courts
            shall have concurrent jurisdiction. I am very sure that they have concurrent
            jurisdiction as the law is now, but on account of a decision of one of the state courts
            of Connecticut, where one judge declined to take jurisdiction in a case because it was
            under a federal statute, the committee thought best to expressly provide in the law that
            the federal courts and the state courts should have concurrent jurisdiction to avoid the
            possibility of such a construction in the future." 45 Cong. Rec. 2253.</p>
         <p>In reply to a question as to the Committee's purpose in recommending this provision,
            "Did you intend to limit the state courts in any way in this matter?", the answer was,
            "Oh, no; just the contrary." 45 Cong. Rec. 2254.</p>
         <p>With these authoritative explanations the bill was passed by the House on February 23,
            1910. 45 Cong. Rec. 2260. It was then sent to the Senate and there referred to its
            Judiciary Committee. The report of that Committee repeated in haec verba the explanation
            of the provision made by the House Committee. See Sen. Rep. No. 432, 61st Cong., 2d
            Sess., p. 5. Senator Borah, who steered the bill in the Senate, said:</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*717</span> "The amendment which has been proposed in the
            latter portion of section 6 was necessitated, if that term can properly be used, by
            reason of a decision of the supreme court of the State of Connecticut. My individual
            view is that the law is now as the amendment attempts to make it &#x97; that is to say,
            that both the federal and state courts have jurisdiction of this matter &#x97;
            concurrent jurisdiction. . . . As I understand the law, unless there is a clause
            prohibiting or inhibiting the state court it always has concurrent jurisdiction with the
            federal courts in such a subject-matter as this. The report cites a number of
            authorities to this effect. But the supreme court of Connecticut refused to assume
            jurisdiction or to take jurisdiction of the matter, though the well-established legal
            principle seems to be absolutely different. I do not believe this amendment is
            necessary. I believe it is thoroughly established that the federal courts and the state
            courts have concurrent jurisdiction. But in order to avoid courts being misled upon this
            proposition this specific provision is thought to be necessary in the law." 45 Cong.
            Rec. 3995. See also his remarks at 45 Cong. Rec. 4034-35.</p>
         <p>The Court appears to draw comfort from the provision of the Act prohibiting removal of a
            suit from a state court of competent jurisdiction to a federal court. The bill as passed
            by the House contained no such provision. It was offered as an amendment on the floor of
            the Senate by Senator Paynter who, in proposing the amendment, made a few remarks that
            are unenlightening for present purposes. The amendment was approved by the Senate
            without further discussion. 45 Cong. Rec. 4093. When the bill came back to the House,
            Representative Clayton, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, explained the purpose
            of this amendment:</p>
         <p>"The real amendment [made by the Senate] and the one that I think is a distinct
            improvement of the bill, <span class="star-pagination">*718</span> certainly more so
            than the other two, is to add . . . these words: `And no case arising under this act and
            brought in any state court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of
            the United States.' And the gentleman, being, as I am, a states-rights Democrat, will
            certainly say that is a decided improvement upon the bill as it originally passed the
            House. Furthermore, I say that this amendment will tend to relieve the federal courts of
            some litigation which can be as well, if not better, determined in the courts of the
            States." 45 Cong. Rec. 4158.</p>
         <p>Such a restriction against removal of litigation normally arising in the state courts is
            not unique in the history of legislation dealing with the business of the lower federal
            courts. Thirty years earlier, Congress had begun to limit the right of removal to the
            federal courts. See, e.g., Act of July 12, 1882, § 4, 22 Stat. 162, 163; Act of March 3,
            1887, 24 Stat. 552, corrected by Act of August 13, 1888, 25 Stat. 433. The removal
            prohibition of the 1910 Act must be regarded as a phase of the movement to ease the
            pressure upon the lower federal courts by curtailing access to them rather than by
            multiplying unduly the number of federal judges. Nothing warrants the inference that
            thereby Congress intended a reversal of the historic relation of state courts to one
            another.</p>
         <p>That no expression of Congress, nor the purposes revealed by it outside of the language
            it employed, calls for a break with the past in giving effect to the 1910 amendment was
            the conclusion reached by this Court upon the fullest consideration of the significance
            of the provision. "The amendment, as appears by its language," it was held in the Second
            Employers' Liability Cases, <span class="citation no-link">
               <span class="volume">223</span>
               <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
               <span class="page">1</span>
            </span>, 56, "instead of granting jurisdiction to the state courts, presupposes that
            they already possessed it." Later, in the Douglas case, the Court noted that the
            amendment "does not purport to require State Courts to entertain suits arising under it,
            but only to empower them to do so, so far <span class="star-pagination">*719</span> as
            the authority of the United States is concerned." 279 U.S. at 387. And again in
            McKnett's case, 292 U.S. at 233, the Court emphasized that "Congress has not attempted
            to compel states to provide courts for the enforcement of the Federal Employers'
            Liability Act." In short, every time the question has arisen this Court has recognized
            that by the 1910 amendment Congress did not write a new chapter in judicial history, nor
            did it modify the historic function of state courts as agencies for the enforcement of
            federal rights employing the same instruments for achieving justice as they employ when
            enforcing rights having their source in state law.</p>
         <p>The Court now holds that, where considerations of equity and justice are otherwise
            compelling, § 6 has deprived the state courts of the power to enjoin a plaintiff from
            pursuing a suit against a carrier in the courts of any state in which the carrier does
            business. But a series of decisions following Davis v. Farmers Co-operative Co., <span

            R.G.W.R. Co. v. Terte, <span class="citation">

            </span>, suits against a carrier in a state where it did business were nevertheless
            found to constitute an unjustifiable burden on commerce and therefore could not be
            maintained. If Congress had conferred obligatory jurisdiction upon the state courts, it
            would have been entirely beyond the province of this Court to hold, as it did in these
            decisions, that a suit in a state court which was given "concurrent jurisdiction" by the
            1910 amendment constituted a burden on commerce. To suggest that the grant of
            "concurrent jurisdiction" repealed the historic powers of equity sanctioned by Cole v.
            Cunningham, <span class="citation">
               <a href="/scotus/txu/cole-v-cunningham/">

               </a>
            </span>, is to imply that in all these cases the Court disregarded what is now found to
            be the right of a plaintiff to resort to a state court, unhampered by the authority of
            the state courts to invoke their familiar equitable powers to restrain oppressive and
               <span class="star-pagination">*720</span> vexatious suits in other state courts. This
            is to say that in all these cases over a period of years this Court disregarded the
            jurisdictional requirements of the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Yet the Act was
            constantly before the Court, and, it may not be amiss to recall, no member of this
            Court, in modern times at least, was more familiar with and more mindful of
            jurisdictional requirements than Mr. Justice Brandeis, who spoke for a unanimous Court
            in both the Davis and Mix cases.</p>
         <p>The Court does not now overrule these decisions. They stand as unchallenged authorities
            that, in giving the state courts concurrent jurisdiction of suits under the Act,
            Congress did not thereby preclude the application of principles of equity and justice to
            such suits. These decisions show clearly that § 6 did not give the state courts
            compulsive jurisdiction; it merely conferred authority to be administered in the context
            of existing law.</p>
         <p>The power invoked by Tennessee in this case was a familiar head of equity jurisdiction
            long before the Constitution. Injunctions by the chancellor against suits in other
            courts go back to at least the late sixteenth century. See Cliffe v. Turnor, Cary 83
            (1579); Chock v. Chea, Cary 83 (1579); Tanfield v. Davenport, Tot. 114 (1638); Trinick
            v. Bordfield, Tot. 117 (1638). When Lord Chancellor Clarendon in 1677 refused to enjoin
            a foreign attachment, Love v. Baker, Ch. Cas. 67, the reporter noted that "all the bar
            was of another opinion. It was said, the injunction did not lie for foreign
            jurisdictions, nor out of the king's dominions. But to that it was answered, the
            injunction was not to the court, but to the party." The opinion of the bar soon became
            the accepted law of England. In the leading case of Lord Portarlington v. Soulby, 3 Myl.
            &amp;amp; K. 104, Brougham, L.C., expressed the historic doctrine of equity
            jurisdiction. Referring to the attitude of the bar towards Love v. Baker, he commented:
            "A very sound answer, as it appears to me; for the same argument might <span
               class="star-pagination">*721</span> apply to a Court within this country, which no
            order of this Court ever affects to bind, our orders being only pointed at the parties
            to restrain them from proceeding. Accordingly, this case of Love v. Baker has not been
            recognized or followed in later times." 3 Myl. &amp;amp; K. at 107. See Wharton v. May,
            5 Ves. Jr. 27; Kennedy v. Earl of Cassillis, 2 Swans. 313; Harrison v. Gurney, 2 Jac.
            &amp;amp; W. 563; Bushby v. Munday, 5 Madd. 184; Beauchamp v. Marquis of Huntley, Jac.
            546; Eden on Injunctions (1822 ed.) pp. 3 et seq., 101-02.</p>
         <p>This doctrine of equitable power has been universally accepted by American courts. See,

            the very fabric of the state courts as we have known them in our whole history. And
            nothing in the Federal Employers' Liability Act, its language, its history, or its

            no more than maintain facilities for solicitation of business. The three cases last

         <p>[5] House Resolution 17263, 61st Congress, 2d Session, which eventually became the Act
            of 1910, contained no prohibition or restriction upon removal of suits from state courts
            when it passed the House, and was reported to the Senate by the Senate Committee on the
            Judiciary. Sen. Rep. No. 432, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., March 22, 1910. Upon the floor of
            the Senate several amendments were proposed, varying in terms, but all seeking to
            achieve some such limitation. 45 Cong. Rec. 3995, 3998, 4051. Senator Paynter's second
            version was the amendment eventually adopted. 45 Cong. Rec. 4093. The House concurred in
            the Senate amendment without modification. 45 Cong. Rcc. 4159. </p>
         <p>The reason for the amendment was stated by Senator Paynter thus:</p>
         <p>"I offer an amendment which will give to the plaintiff the right to select the forum in
            which his case shall be tried. He can select the federal or the state court, as he may
            prefer, to try his case arising under the act in question." P. 4051.</p>
         <p>"If this amendment is adopted, the Congress has not conferred by the act under
            consideration the exclusive jurisdiction upon state courts. The plaintiff can choose
            either the federal or state court in which to prosecute his action. The effect of my
            amendment is to prevent the removal of the action from the state courts when brought
            there." P. 4093.</p>

            </span>, do not impinge upon this principle. In the former case, an Ohio statute forbade
            suits in its courts for wrongful death occurring in another state unless the decedent
            was a citizen of Ohio. This Court saw no discrimination against personal representatives
            of any decedent, since their right to sue did not depend upon their citizenship but upon
            the citizenship of their decedent. In the latter case, a statute of New York, which gave
            only discretionary jurisdiction to suits by nonresidents but compulsory jurisdiction to
            suits by residents was held valid because it treated citizens and noncitizens alike and
            tested their right to maintain an action by their residence or nonresidence.</p>
