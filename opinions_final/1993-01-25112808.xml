         <p>Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
         <p>Petitioner Leonel Torres Herrera was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death
            in January 1982. He unsuccessfully challenged the conviction on direct appeal and state
            collateral proceedings in the Texas state courts, and in a federal habeas petition. In
            February 1992-10 years after his conviction &#x97; he urged in a second federal habeas
            petition that he was "actually innocent" of the murder for which he was sentenced to
            death, and that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment
            and the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due process of law therefore forbid his
            execution. He supported this claim with affidavits tending to show that his now-dead
            brother, rather than he, had been the perpetrator of the crime. Petitioner urges us to
            hold that this showing of innocence entitles him to relief in this federal habeas
            proceeding. We hold that it does not.</p>
         <p>Shortly before 11 p.m. on an evening in late September 1981, the body of Texas
            Department of Public Safety Officer David Rucker was found by a passer-by on a stretch
            of highway about six miles east of Los Fresnos, Texas, a few miles north of Brownsville
            in the Rio Grande Valley. Rucker's body was lying beside his patrol car. He had been
            shot in the head.</p>
         <p>At about the same time, Los Fresnos Police Officer Enrique Carrisalez observed a
            speeding vehicle traveling west towards Los Fresnos, away from the place where Rucker's
            body had been found, along the same road. Carrisalez, who was accompanied in his patrol
            car by Enrique Hernandez, turned on his flashing red lights and pursued the speeding
               <span class="star-pagination">*394</span> vehicle. After the car had stopped briefly
            at a red light, it signaled that it would pull over and did so. The patrol car pulled up
            behind it. Carrisalez took a flashlight and walked toward the car of the speeder. The
            driver opened his door and exchanged a few words with Carrisalez before firing at least
            one shot at Carrisalez' chest. The officer died nine days later.</p>
         <p>Petitioner Herrera was arrested a few days after the shootings and charged with the
            capital murder of both Carrisalez and Rucker. He was tried and found guilty of the
            capital murder of Carrisalez in January 1982, and sentenced to death. In July 1982,
            petitioner pleaded guilty to the murder of Rucker.</p>
         <p>At petitioner's trial for the murder of Carrisalez, Hernandez, who had witnessed
            Carrisalez' slaying from the officer's patrol car, identified petitioner as the person
            who had wielded the gun. A declaration by Officer Carrisalez to the same effect, made
            while he was in the hospital, was also admitted. Through a license plate check, it was
            shown that the speeding car involved in Carrisalez' murder was registered to
            petitioner's "live-in" girlfriend. Petitioner was known to drive this car, and he had a
            set of keys to the car in his pants pocket when he was arrested. Hernandez identified
            the car as the vehicle from which the murderer had emerged to fire the fatal shot. He
            also testified that there had been only one person in the car that night.</p>
         <p>The evidence showed that Herrera's Social Security card had been found alongside
            Rucker's patrol car on the night he was killed. Splatters of blood on the car identified
            as the vehicle involved in the shootings, and on petitioner's blue jeans and wallet were
            identified as type A blood&#x97;the same type which Rucker had. (Herrera has type O
            blood.) Similar evidence with respect to strands of hair found in the car indicated that
            the hair was Rucker's and not Herrera's. A handwritten letter was also found on the
            person of petitioner <span class="star-pagination">*395</span> when he was arrested,
            which strongly implied that he had killed Rucker.<span class="sup">[1]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Petitioner appealed his conviction and sentence, arguing, among other things, that
            Hernandez' and Carrisalez' identifications were unreliable and improperly admitted. The
            Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, Herrera v. State, 682 S. W. 2d 313 (1984), and
            we denied certiorari, 471 U. S. 1131 (1985). Petitioner's application for state habeas
            relief was denied. Ex parte Herrera, No. 12,848-02 (Tex. Crim. App., Aug. 2, 1985).
            Petitioner then filed a federal habeas <span class="star-pagination">*396</span>
            petition, again challenging the identifications offered against him at trial. This
            petition was denied, see 904 F. 2d 944 (CA5), and we again denied certiorari, 498 U. S.
            925 (1990).</p>
         <p>Petitioner next returned to state court and filed a second habeas petition, raising,
            among other things, a claim of "actual innocence" based on newly discovered evidence. In
            support of this claim petitioner presented the affidavits of Hector Villarreal, an
            attorney who had represented petitioner's brother, Raul Herrera, Sr., and of Juan Franco
            Palacious, one of Raul, Senior's former cellmates. Both individuals claimed that Raul,
            Senior, who died in 1984, had told them that he &#x97; and not petitioner &#x97; had
            killed Officers Rucker and Carrisalez.<span class="sup">[2]</span> The State District
            Court denied this application, finding that "no evidence at trial remotely suggest[ed]
            that anyone other than [petitioner] committed the offense." Ex parte Herrera, No.
            81&#x97;CR-672&#x97;C (Tex. 197th Jud. Dist., Jan. 14, 1991), ¶ 35. The Texas Court of
            Criminal Appeals affirmed, Ex parte Herrera, 819 S. W. 2d 528 (1991), and we denied
            certiorari, Herrera v. Texas, 502 U. S. 1085 (1992).</p>
         <p>In February 1992, petitioner lodged the instant habeas petition &#x97; his second
            &#x97;in federal court, alleging, among other things, that he is innocent of the murders
            of Rucker and Carrisalez, and that his execution would thus violate the Eighth <span
               class="star-pagination">*397</span> and Fourteenth Amendments. In addition to
            proffering the above affidavits, petitioner presented the affidavits of Raul Herrera,
            Jr., Raul, Senior's son, and Jose Ybarra, Jr., a schoolmate of the Herrera brothers.
            Raul, Junior, averred that he had witnessed his father shoot Officers Rucker and
            Carrisalez and petitioner was not present. Raul, Junior, was nine years old at the time
            of the killings. Ybarra alleged that Raul, Senior, told him one summer night in 1983
            that he had shot the two police officers.<span class="sup">[3]</span> Petitioner alleged
            that law enforcement officials were aware of this evidence, and had withheld it in
            violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963).</p>
         <p>The District Court dismissed most of petitioner's claims as an abuse of the writ. No.
            M-92-30 (SD Tex., Feb. 17, 1992). However, "in order to ensure that Petitioner can
            assert his constitutional claims and out of a sense of fairness and due process," the
            District Court granted petitioner's request for a stay of execution so that he could
            present his claim of actual innocence, along with the Raul, Junior, and Ybarra
            affidavits, in state court. App. 38-39. Although it initially dismissed petitioner's
            Brady claim on the ground that petitioner had failed to present "any evidence of
            withholding exculpatory material by the prosecution," App. 37, the District Court also
            granted an evidentiary hearing on this claim after reconsideration, id., at 54.</p>
         <p>The Court of Appeals vacated the stay of execution. 954 F. 2d 1029 (CA5 1992). It agreed
            with the District Court's initial conclusion that there was no evidentiary basis for
            petitioner's Brady claim, and found disingenuous petitioner's attempt to couch his claim
            of actual innocence in Brady terms. 954 F. 2d, at 1032. Absent an accompanying
            constitutional violation, the Court of Appeals held that petitioner's claim <span
               class="star-pagination">*398</span> of actual innocence was not cognizable because,
            under Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 317 (1963), "the existence merely of newly
            discovered evidence relevant to the guilt of a state prisoner is not a ground for relief
            on federal habeas corpus." See 954 F. 2d, at 1034.<span class="sup">[4]</span> We
            granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 1085 (1992), and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
            stayed petitioner's execution. We now affirm.</p>
         <p>Petitioner asserts that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States
            Constitution prohibit the execution of a person who is innocent of the crime for which
            he was convicted. This proposition has an elemental appeal, as would the similar
            proposition that the Constitution prohibits the imprisonment of one who is innocent of
            the crime for which he was convicted. After all, the central purpose of any system of
            criminal justice is to convict the guilty and free the innocent. See United States v.
            Nobles, 422 U. S. 225, 230 (1975). But the evidence upon which petitioner's claim of
            innocence rests was not produced at his trial, but rather eight years later. In any
            system of criminal justice, "innocence" or "guilt" must be determined in some sort of a
            judicial proceeding. Petitioner's showing of innocence, and indeed his constitutional
            claim for relief based upon that showing, must be evaluated in the light of the previous
            proceedings in this case, which have stretched over a span of 10 years.</p>
         <p>A person when first charged with a crime is entitled to a presumption of innocence, and
            may insist that his guilt be established beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Winship, 397
            U. S. 358 (1970). Other constitutional provisions also have the effect of ensuring
            against the risk of convicting an innocent <span class="star-pagination">*399</span>
            person. See, e. g., Coy v. Iowa, 487 U. S. 1012 (1988) (right to confront adverse
            witnesses); Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U. S. 400 (1988) (right to compulsory process);
            Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984) (right to effective assistance of
            counsel); Winship, supra (prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt);
            Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145 (1968) (right to jury trial); Brady v. Maryland,
            supra (prosecution must disclose exculpatory evidence); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S.
            335 (1963) (right to assistance of counsel); In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133, 136 (1955)
            (right to "fair trial in a fair tribunal"). In capital cases, we have required
            additional protections because of the nature of the penalty at stake. See, e. g., Beck
            v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980) (jury must be given option of convicting the defendant
            of a lesser offense). All of these constitutional safeguards, of course, make it more
            difficult for the State to rebut and finally overturn the presumption of innocence which
            attaches to every criminal defendant. But we have also observed that "[d]ue process does
            not require that every conceivable step be taken, at whatever cost, to eliminate the
            possibility of convicting an innocent person." Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 208
            (1977). To conclude otherwise would all but paralyze our system for enforcement of the
            criminal law.</p>
         <p>Once a defendant has been afforded a fair trial and convicted of the offense for which
            he was charged, the presumption of innocence disappears. Cf. Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S.
            600, 610 (1974) ("The purpose of the trial stage from the State's point of view is to
            convert a criminal defendant from a person presumed innocent to one found guilty beyond
            a reasonable doubt"). Here, it is not disputed that the State met its burden of proving
            at trial that petitioner was guilty of the capital murder of Officer Carrisalez beyond a
            reasonable doubt. Thus, in the eyes of the law, petitioner does not come before the
            Court as one who is "innocent," but, on the <span class="star-pagination">*400</span>
            contrary, as one who has been convicted by due process of law of two brutal murders.</p>
         <p>Based on affidavits here filed, petitioner claims that evidence never presented to the
            trial court proves him innocent notwithstanding the verdict reached at his trial. Such a
            claim is not cognizable in the state courts of Texas. For to obtain a new trial based on
            newly discovered evidence, a defendant must file a motion within 30 days after
            imposition or suspension of sentence. Tex. Rule App. Proc. 31(a)(1) (1992). The Texas
            courts have construed this 30-day time limit as jurisdictional. See Beathard v. State,
            767 S. W. 2d 423, 433 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989); Drew v. State, 743 S. W. 2d 207, 222-223
            (Tex. Crim. App. 1987).</p>
         <p>Claims of actual innocence based on newly discovered evidence have never been held to
            state a ground for federal habeas relief absent an independent constitutional violation
            occurring in the underlying state criminal proceeding. Chief Justice Warren made this
            clear in Townsend v. Sain, supra, at 317 (emphasis added):</p> "Where newly discovered
         evidence is alleged in a habeas application, evidence which could not reasonably have been
         presented to the state trier of facts, the federal court must grant an evidentiary hearing.
         Of course, such evidence must bear upon the constitutionality of the applicant's detention;
         the existence merely of newly discovered evidence relevant to the guilt of a state prisoner
         is not a ground for relief on federal ha- beas corpus. " <p>This rule is grounded in the
            principle that federal habeas courts sit to ensure that individuals are not imprisoned
            in violation of the Constitution &#x97; not to correct errors of fact. See, e. g., Moore
            v. Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86, 87-88 (1923) (Holmes, J.) ("[W]hat we have to deal with [on
            habeas review] is not the petitioners' innocence or guilt but solely the question
            whether their constitutional rights have been preserved"); <span class="star-pagination"
               >*401</span> Hyde v. Shine, 199 U. S. 62, 84 (1905) ("[I]t is well settled that upon
            habeas corpus the court will not weigh the evidence") (emphasis in original); Ex parte
            Terry, 128 U. S. 289, 305 (1888) ("As the writ of habeas corpus does not perform the
            office of a writ of error or an appeal, [the facts establishing guilt] cannot be
            re-examined or reviewed in this collateral proceeding") (emphasis in original).</p>
         <p>More recent authority construing federal habeas statutes speaks in a similar vein.
            "Federal courts are not forums in which to relitigate state trials." Barefoot v.
            Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 887 (1983). The guilt or innocence determination in state
            criminal trials is "a decisive and portentous event." Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72,
            90 (1977). "Society's resources have been concentrated at that time and place in order
            to decide, within the limits of human fallibility, the question of guilt or innocence of
            one of its citizens." Ibid. Few rulings would be more disruptive of our federal system
            than to provide for federal habeas review of free standing claims of actual
            innocence.</p>
         <p>Our decision in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), comes as close to authorizing
            evidentiary review of a statecourt conviction on federal habeas as any of our cases.
            There, we held that a federal habeas court may review a claim that the evidence adduced
            at a state trial was not sufficient to convict a criminal defendant beyond a reasonable
            doubt. But in so holding, we emphasized:</p> "[T]his inquiry does not require a court to
         `ask itself whether it believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a
         reasonable doubt.' Instead, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in
         the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found
         the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. This familiar standard gives
         full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the
         testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable <span class="star-pagination"
            >*402</span> inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts." Id., at 318-319 (citations
         omitted; emphasis in original). <p>We specifically noted that "the standard announced . . .
            does not permit a court to make its own subjective determination of guilt or innocence."
            Id., at 320, n. 13.</p>
         <p>The type of federal habeas review sought by petitioner here is different in critical
            respects than that authorized by Jackson. First, the Jackson inquiry is aimed at
            determining whether there has been an independent constitutional violation&#x97;i. e., a
            conviction based on evidence that fails to meet the Winship standard. Thus, federal
            habeas courts act in their historic capacity &#x97; to assure that the habeas petitioner
            is not being held in violation of his or her federal constitutional rights. Second, the
            sufficiency of the evidence review authorized by Jackson is limited to "record
            evidence." 443 U. S., at 318. Jackson does not extend to nonrecord evidence, including
            newly discovered evidence. Finally, the Jackson inquiry does not focus on whether the
            trier of fact made the correct guilt or innocence determination, but rather whether it
            made a rational decision to convict or acquit.</p>
         <p>Petitioner is understandably imprecise in describing the sort of federal relief to which
            a suitable showing of actual innocence would entitle him. In his brief he states that
            the federal habeas court should have "an important initial opportunity to hear the
            evidence and resolve the merits of Petitioner's claim." Brief for Petitioner 42.
            Acceptance of this view would presumably require the habeas court to hear testimony from
            the witnesses who testified at trial as well as those who made the statements in the
            affidavits which petitioner has presented, and to determine anew whether or not
            petitioner is guilty of the murder of Officer Carrisalez. Indeed, the dissent's approach
            differs little from that hypothesized here.</p>
         <p>The dissent would place the burden on petitioner to show that he is "probably" innocent.
            Post, at 442. Although <span class="star-pagination">*403</span> petitioner would not be
            entitled to discovery "as a matter of right," the District Court would retain its
            "discretion to order discovery . . . when it would help the court make a reliable
            determination with respect to the prisoner's claim." Post, at 444. And although the
            District Court would not be required to hear testimony from the witnesses who testified
            at trial or the affiants upon whom petitioner relies, the dissent would allow the
            District Court to do so "if the petition warrants a hearing." Ibid. At the end of the
            day, the dissent would have the District Court "make a case-by-case determination about
            the reliability of the newly discovered evidence under the circumstances," and then
            "weigh the evidence in favor of the prisoner against the evidence of his guilt." Post,
            at 443.</p>
         <p>The dissent fails to articulate the relief that would be available if petitioner were to
            meets its "probable innocence" standard. Would it be commutation of petitioner's death
            sentence, new trial, or unconditional release from imprisonment? The typical relief
            granted in federal habeas corpus is a conditional order of release unless the State
            elects to retry the successful habeas petitioner, or in a capital case a similar
            conditional order vacating the death sentence. Were petitioner to satisfy the dissent's
            "probable innocence" standard, therefore, the District Court would presumably be
            required to grant a conditional order of relief, which would in effect require the State
            to retry petitioner 10 years after his first trial, not because of any constitutional
            violation which had occurred at the first trial, but simply because of a belief that in
            light of petitioner's new-found evidence a jury might find him not guilty at a second
            trial.</p>
         <p>Yet there is no guarantee that the guilt or innocence determination would be any more
            exact. To the contrary, the passage of time only diminishes the reliability of criminal
            adjudications. See McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 491 (1991) ("[W]hen a habeas
            petitioner succeeds in obtaining a new trial, the `erosion of memory and dispersion of
            witnesses <span class="star-pagination">*404</span> that occur with the passage of time'
            prejudice the government and diminish the chances of a reliable criminal adjudication")
            (quoting Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S. 436, 453 (1986) (plurality opinion) (internal
            quotation marks omitted; citation omitted)); United States v. Smith, 331 U. S. 469, 476
            (1947). Under the dissent's approach, the District Court would be placed in the even
            more difficult position of having to weigh the probative value of "hot" and "cold"
            evidence on petitioner's guilt or innocence.</p>
         <p>This is not to say that our habeas jurisprudence casts a blind eye toward innocence. In
            a series of cases culminating with Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333 (1992), decided last
            Term, we have held that a petitioner otherwise subject to defenses of abusive or
            successive use of the writ may have his federal constitutional claim considered on the
            merits if he makes a proper showing of actual innocence. This rule, or fundamental
            miscarriage of justice exception, is grounded in the "equitable discretion" of habeas
            courts to see that federal constitutional errors do not result in the incarceration of
            innocent persons. See McCleskey, supra, at 502. But this body of our habeas
            jurisprudence makes clear that a claim of "actual innocence" is not itself a
            constitutional claim, but instead a gateway through which a habeas petitioner must pass
            to have his otherwise barred constitutional claim considered on the merits.</p>
         <p>Petitioner in this case is simply not entitled to habeas relief based on the reasoning
            of this line of cases. For he does not seek excusal of a procedural error so that he may
            bring an independent constitutional claim challenging his conviction or sentence, but
            rather argues that he is entitled to habeas relief because newly discovered evidence
            shows that his conviction is factually incorrect. The fundamental miscarriage of justice
            exception is available "only where the prisoner supplements his constitutional claim
            with a colorable showing of factual innocence." Kuhlmann, supra, at 454 (emphasis
            added). We have never held that it extends to <span class="star-pagination">*405</span>
            free standing claims of actual innocence. Therefore, the exception is inapplicable
            here.</p>
         <p>Petitioner asserts that this case is different because he has been sentenced to death.
            But we have "refused to hold that the fact that a death sentence has been imposed
            requires a different standard of review on federal habeas corpus." Murray v. Giarratano,
            492 U. S. 1, 9 (1989) (plurality opinion). We have, of course, held that the Eighth
            Amendment requires increased reliability of the process by which capital punishment may
            be imposed. See, e. g., McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U. S. 433 (1990) (unanimity
            requirement impermissibly limits jurors' consideration of mitigating evidence); Eddings
            v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982) (jury must be allowed to consider all of a capital
            defendant's mitigating character evidence); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978)
            (plurality opinion) (same). But petitioner's claim does not fit well into the doctrine
            of these cases, since, as we have pointed out, it is far from clear that a second trial
            10 years after the first trial would produce a more reliable result.</p>
         <p>Perhaps mindful of this, petitioner urges not that he necessarily receive a new trial,
            but that his death sentence simply be vacated if a federal habeas court deems that a
            satisfactory showing of "actual innocence" has been made. Tr. of Oral Arg. 19-20. But
            such a result is scarcely logical; petitioner's claim is not that some error was made in
            imposing a capital sentence upon him, but that a fundamental error was made in finding
            him guilty of the underlying murder in the first place. It would be a rather strange
            jurisprudence, in these circumstances, which held that under our Constitution he could
            not be executed, but that he could spend the rest of his life in prison.</p>
         <p>Petitioner argues that our decision in Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399 (1986),
            supports his position. The plurality in Ford held that, because the Eighth Amendment
            prohibits the execution of insane persons, certain procedural protections inhere in the
            sanity determination. "[I]f the Constitution <span class="star-pagination">*406</span>
            renders the fact or timing of his execution contingent upon establishment of a further
            fact," Justice Marshall wrote, "then that fact must be determined with the high regard
            for truth that befits a decision affecting the life or death of a human being." Id., at
            411. Because the Florida scheme for determining the sanity of persons sentenced to death
            failed "to achieve even the minimal degree of reliability," id., at 413, the plurality
            concluded that Ford was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his sanity before the
            District Court.</p>
         <p>Unlike petitioner here, Ford did not challenge the validity of his conviction. Rather,
            he challenged the constitutionality of his death sentence in view of his claim of
            insanity. Because Ford's claim went to a matter of punishment &#x97; not guilt &#x97; it
            was properly examined within the purview of the Eighth Amendment. Moreover, unlike the
            question of guilt or innocence, which becomes more uncertain with time for evidentiary
            reasons, the issue of sanity is properly considered in proximity to the execution.
            Finally, unlike the sanity determination under the Florida scheme at issue in Ford, the
            guilt or innocence determination in our system of criminal justice is made "with the
            high regard for truth that befits a decision affecting the life or death of a human
            being." Id., at 411.</p>
         <p>Petitioner also relies on Johnson v. Mississippi, 486 U. S. 578 (1988), where we held
            that the Eighth Amendment requires reexamination of a death sentence based in part on a
            prior felony conviction which was set aside in the rendering State after the capital
            sentence was imposed. There, the State insisted that it was too late in the day to raise
            this point. But we pointed out that the Mississippi Supreme Court had previously
            considered similar claims by writ of error coram nobis. Thus, there was no need to
            override state law relating to newly discovered evidence in order to consider Johnson's
            claim on the merits. Here, there is no doubt that petitioner seeks additional process
            &#x97; an evidentiary hearing on his claim of "actual innocence" based on <span
               class="star-pagination">*407</span> newly discovered evidence &#x97; which is not
            available under Texas law more than 30 days after imposition or suspension of sentence.
            Tex. Rule App. Proc. 31(a)(1) (1992).<span class="sup">[5]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Alternatively, petitioner invokes the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due process of
            law in support of his claim that his showing of actual innocence entitles him to a new
            trial, or at least to a vacation of his death sentence.<span class="sup">[6]</span>
            "[B]ecause the States have considerable expertise in matters of criminal procedure and
            the criminal process is grounded in centuries of common-law tradition," we have
            "exercis[ed] substantial deference to legislative judgments in this area." Medina v.
            California, 505 U. S. 437, 445-446 (1992). Thus, we have found criminal process lacking
            only where it "`offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and <span
               class="star-pagination">*408</span> conscience of our people as to be ranked as
            fundamental' " Ibid. (quoting Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 202 (1977)).
            "Historical practice is probative of whether a procedural rule can be characterized as
            fundamental." 505 U. S., at 446.</p>
         <p>The Constitution itself, of course, makes no mention of new trials. New trials in
            criminal cases were not granted in England until the end of the 17th century. And even
            then, they were available only in misdemeanor cases, though the writ of error coram
            nobis was available for some errors of fact in felony cases. Orfield, New Trial in
            Federal Criminal Cases, 2 Vill. L. Rev. 293, 304 (1957). The First Congress provided for
            new trials for "reasons for which new trials have usually been granted in courts of
            law." Act of Sept. 24, 1789, ch. 20, § 17, 1 Stat. 83. This rule was early held to
            extend to criminal cases. See Sparf v. United States, 156 U. S. 51, 175 (1895) (Gray,
            J., dissenting) (citing cases). One of the grounds upon which new trials were granted
            was newly discovered evidence. See F. Wharton, Criminal Pleading and Practice §§
            854-874, pp. 584-592 (8th ed. 1880).</p>
         <p>The early federal cases adhere to the common-law rule that a new trial may be granted
            only during the term of court in which the final judgment was entered. See, e. g.,
            United States v. Mayer, 235 U. S. 55, 67 (1914); United States v. Simmons, <span

            power to correct inaccuracies in mere matters of form, or clerical errors." 235 U. S.,
            at 67. In 1934, this Court departed from the common-law rule and adopted a time
            limit&#x97;60 days after final judgment &#x97; for filing new trial motions based on
            newly discovered evidence. Rule II(3), Criminal Rules of Practice and Procedure, 292 U.
            S. 659, 662. Four years later, we amended Rule II(3) to allow such motions in capital
            cases "at any time" before the execution took place. 304 U. S. 592 (1938) (codified at
            18 U. S. C. § 688 (1940)).</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*409</span> There ensued a debate as to whether this Court
            should abolish the time limit for filing new trial motions based on newly discovered
            evidence to prevent a miscarriage of justice, or retain a time limit even in capital
            cases to promote finality. See Orfield, supra, at 299-304. In 1946, we set a 2-year time
            limit for filing new trial motions based on newly discovered evidence and abolished the
            exception for capital cases. Rule 33, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 327 U. S.
            821, 855-856 ("A motion for a new trial based on the ground of newly discovered evidence
            may be made only before or within two years after final judgment").<span class="sup"
               >[7]</span> We have strictly construed the Rule 33 time limits. Cf. United States v.
            Smith, 331 U. S. 469, 473 (1947). And the Rule's treatment of new trials based on newly
            discovered evidence has not changed since its adoption.</p>
         <p>The American Colonies adopted the English common law on new trials. Riddell, New Trial
            in Present Practice, 27 Yale L. J. 353, 360 (1917). Thus, where new trials were
            available, motions for such relief typically had to be filed before the expiration of
            the term during which the trial was held. H. Underhill, Criminal Evidence 579, n. 1
            (1898); J. Bassett, Criminal Pleading and Practice 313 (1885). Over time, many States
            enacted statutes providing for new trials <span class="star-pagination">*410</span> in
            all types of cases. Some States also extended the time period for filing new trial
            motions beyond the term of court, but most States required that such motions be made
            within a few days after the verdict was rendered or before the judgment was entered. See
            American Law Institute Code of Criminal Procedure 1040-1042 (Official Draft 1931)
            (reviewing contemporary new trials rules).</p>
         <p>The practice in the States today, while of limited relevance to our historical inquiry,
            is divergent. Texas is one of 17 States that requires a new trial motion based on newly
            discovered evidence to be made within 60 days of judgment.<span class="sup">[8]</span>
            One State adheres to the common-law rule and requires that such a motion be filed during
            the term in which judgment was rendered.<span class="sup">[9]</span> Eighteen
            jurisdictions have time limits ranging between one and three years, with 10 States and
            the District of Columbia following the 2-year federal time limit.<span class="sup"
               >[10]</span>
            <span class="star-pagination">*411</span> Only 15 States allow a new trial motion based
            on newly discovered evidence to be filed more than three years after conviction. Of
            these States, four have waivable time limits of less than 120 days, two have waivable
            time limits of more than 120 days, and nine States have no time limits.<span class="sup"

         <p>In light of the historical availability of new trials, our own amendments to Rule 33,
            and the contemporary practice in the States, we cannot say that Texas' refusal to
            entertain petitioner's newly discovered evidence eight years after his conviction
            transgresses a principle of fundamental fairness "rooted in the traditions and
            conscience of our people." Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S., at 202 (internal quotation
            marks and citations omitted). This is not to say, however, that petitioner is left
            without a forum to raise his actual innocence claim. For under Texas law, petitioner may
            file a request for executive clemency. See Tex. Const., Art. IV, § 11; Tex. Code Crim.
            Proc. Ann., Art. 48.01 (Vernon 1979). Clemency<span class="sup">[12]</span> is deeply
            rooted in our Anglo-American tradition <span class="star-pagination">*412</span> of law,
            and is the historic remedy for preventing miscarriages of justice where judicial process
            has been exhausted.<span class="sup">[13]</span>
         </p>
         <p>In England, the clemency power was vested in the Crown and can be traced back to the
            700's. W. Humbert, The Pardoning Power of the President 9 (1941). Blackstone thought
            this "one of the great advantages of monarchy in general, above any other form of
            government; that there is a magistrate, who has it in his power to extend mercy,
            wherever he thinks it is deserved: holding a court of equity in his own breast, to
            soften the rigour of the general law, in such criminal cases as merit an exemption from
            punishment." 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *397. Clemency provided the principal avenue
            of relief for individuals convicted of criminal offenses &#x97; most of which were
            capital &#x97; because there was no right of appeal until 1907. 1 L. Radzinowicz, A
            History of English Criminal Law 122 (1948). It was the only means by which one could
            challenge his conviction on the ground of innocence. United States Dept. of Justice, 3

            </span>, 160-161 (1833), Chief Justice Marshall expounded on the President's pardon
            power:</p> "As this power had been exercised from time immemorial by the executive of
         that nation whose language is our language, and to whose judicial institutions ours bear a
         close resemblance; we adopt their principles respecting the operation and effect of a
         pardon, and look into their books for the rules prescribing the manner in which it is to be
         used by the person who would avail himself of it. "A pardon is an act of grace, proceeding
         from the power entrusted with the execution of the laws, which exempts the individual, on
         whom it is bestowed, from the punishment the law inflicts for a crime he has committed. It
         is the private, though official act of the executive magistrate, delivered to the
         individual for whose benefit it is intended, and not communicated officially to the court.
         It is a constituent part of the judicial system, that the judge sees only with judicial
         eyes, and knows nothing respecting any particular case, of which he is not informed
         judicially. A private deed, not communicated to him, whatever may be its character, whether
         a pardon or release, is totally unknown and cannot be acted on. The looseness which would
         be introduced into judicial proceedings, would prove fatal to the great principles of
         justice, if the judge might notice and act upon facts not brought regularly into the cause.
         Such a proceeding, in ordinary cases, would subvert the best established principles, and
         overturn those rules which have been settled by the wisdom of ages." <p>See also Ex parte

         <p>Of course, although the Constitution vests in the President a pardon power, it does not
            require the States to enact a clemency mechanism. Yet since the British Colonies were
            founded, clemency has been available in America. C. Jensen, The Pardoning Power in the
            American States 3-4 (1922). The original States were reluctant to vest the clemency
            power in the executive. And although this power has gravitated toward the executive over
            time, several States have split the clemency power between the Governor and an advisory
            board selected by the legislature. See Survey of Release Procedures, supra, at 91-98.
            Today, all 36 States that authorize capital punishment have constitutional or statutory
            provisions for clemency.<span class="sup">[14]</span>

         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*415</span> Executive clemency has provided the "fail
            safe" in our criminal justice system. K. Moore, Pardons: Justice, Mercy, and the Public
            Interest 131 (1989). It is an unalterable fact that our judicial system, like the human
            beings who administer it, is fallible. But history is replete with examples of
            wrongfully convicted persons who have been pardoned in the wake of after-discovered
            evidence establishing their innocence. In his classic work, Professor Edwin Borchard
            compiled 65 cases in which it was later determined that individuals had been wrongfully
            convicted of crimes. Clemency provided the relief mechanism in 47 of these cases; the
            remaining cases ended in judgments of acquittals after new trials. E. Borchard,
            Convicting the Innocent (1932). Recent authority confirms that over the past century
            clemency has been exercised frequently in capital cases in which demonstrations of
            "actual innocence" have been made. See M. Radelet, H. Bedau, &amp;amp; C. Putnam, In
            Spite of Innocence 282-356 (1992).<span class="sup">[15]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*416</span> In Texas, the Governor has the power, upon the
            recommendation of a majority of the Board of Pardons and Paroles, to grant clemency.
            Tex. Const., Art. IV, § 11; Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 48.01 (Vernon 1979). The
            board's consideration is triggered upon request of the individual sentenced to death,
            his or her representative, or the Governor herself. In capital cases, a request may be
            made for a full pardon, Tex. Admin. Code, Tit. 37, § 143.1 (West Supp. 1992), a
            commutation of death sentence to life imprisonment or appropriate maximum penalty, §
            143.57, or a reprieve of execution, § 143.43. The Governor has the sole authority to
            grant one reprieve in any capital case not exceeding 30 days. § 143.41(a).</p>
         <p>The Texas clemency procedures contain specific guidelines for pardons on the ground of
            innocence. The board will entertain applications for a recommendation of full pardon
            because of innocence upon receipt of the following: "(1) a written unanimous
            recommendation of the current trial officials of the court of conviction; and/or (2) a
            certified order or judgment of a court having jurisdiction accompanied by certified copy
            of the findings of fact (if any); and (3) affidavits of witnesses upon which the finding
            of innocence is based." § 143.2. In this case, petitioner has apparently sought a 30day
            reprieve from the Governor, but has yet to apply for a pardon, or even a commutation, on
            the ground of innocence or otherwise. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7, 34.</p>
         <p>As the foregoing discussion illustrates, in state criminal proceedings the trial is the
            paramount event for determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Federal habeas
            review of state convictions has traditionally been limited to claims of constitutional
            violations occurring in the course of the underlying state criminal proceedings. Our
            federal habeas cases have treated claims of "actual innocence," not as an independent
            constitutional claim, but as a basis upon which a habeas petitioner may have an
            independent constitutional claim considered on the merits, even though his habeas <span
               class="star-pagination">*417</span> petition would otherwise be regarded as
            successive or abusive. History shows that the traditional remedy for claims of innocence
            based on new evidence, discovered too late in the day to file a new trial motion, has
            been executive clemency.</p>
         <p>We may assume, for the sake of argument in deciding this case, that in a capital case a
            truly persuasive demonstration of "actual innocence" made after trial would render the
            execution of a defendant unconstitutional, and warrant federal habeas relief if there
            were no state avenue open to process such a claim. But because of the very disruptive
            effect that entertaining claims of actual innocence would have on the need for finality
            in capital cases, and the enormous burden that having to retry cases based on often
            stale evidence would place on the States, the threshold showing for such an assumed
            right would necessarily be extraordinarily high. The showing made by petitioner in this
            case falls far short of any such threshold.</p>
         <p>Petitioner's newly discovered evidence consists of affidavits. In the new trial context,
            motions based solely upon affidavits are disfavored because the affiants' statements are
            obtained without the benefit of cross-examination and an opportunity to make credibility
            determinations. See Orfield, 2 Vill. L. Rev., at 333. Petitioner's affidavits are
            particularly suspect in this regard because, with the exception of Raul Herrera, Jr.'s
            affidavit, they consist of hearsay. Likewise, in reviewing petitioner's new evidence, we
            are mindful that defendants often abuse new trial motions "as a method of delaying
            enforcement of just sentences." United States v. Johnson, 327 U. S. 106, 112 (1946).
            Although we are not presented with a new trial motion per se, we believe the likelihood
            of abuse is as great &#x97; or greater &#x97; here.</p>
         <p>The affidavits filed in this habeas proceeding were given over eight years after
            petitioner's trial. No satisfactory explanation has been given as to why the affiants
            waited until the 11th hour&#x97;and, indeed, until after the alleged perpetrator <span
               class="star-pagination">*418</span> of the murders himself was dead &#x97; to make
            their statements. Cf. Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U. S., at 414 ("[I]t is . .. reasonable to
            presume that there is something suspect about a defense witness who is not identified
            until after the 11th hour has passed"). Equally troubling, no explanation has been
            offered as to why petitioner, by hypothesis an innocent man, pleaded guilty to the
            murder of Rucker.</p>
         <p>Moreover, the affidavits themselves contain inconsistencies, and therefore fail to
            provide a convincing account of what took place on the night Officers Rucker and
            Carrisalez were killed. For instance, the affidavit of Raul, Junior, who was nine years
            old at the time, indicates that there were three people in the speeding car from which
            the murderer emerged, whereas Hector Villarreal attested that Raul, Senior, told him
            that there were two people in the car that night. Of course, Hernandez testified at
            petitioner's trial that the murderer was the only occupant of the car. The affidavits
            also conflict as to the direction in which the vehicle was heading when the murders took
            place and petitioner's whereabouts on the night of the killings.</p>
         <p>Finally, the affidavits must be considered in light of the proof of petitioner's guilt
            at trial &#x97; proof which included two eyewitness identifications, numerous pieces of
            circumstantial evidence, and a handwritten letter in which petitioner apologized for
            killing the officers and offered to turn himself in under certain conditions. See supra,
            at 393-395, and n. 1. That proof, even when considered alongside petitioner's belated
            affidavits, points strongly to petitioner's guilt.</p>
         <p>This is not to say that petitioner's affidavits are without probative value. Had this
            sort of testimony been offered at trial, it could have been weighed by the jury, along
            with the evidence offered by the State and petitioner, in deliberating upon its verdict.
            Since the statements in the affidavits contradict the evidence received at trial, the
            jury would have had to decide important issues of credibility. But coming 10 years after
            petitioner's trial, this showing of innocence falls <span class="star-pagination"
               >*419</span> far short of that which would have to be made in order to trigger the
            sort of constitutional claim which we have assumed, arguendo, to exist.</p>

            or offensive to a "` "principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of
            our people as to be ranked as fundamental,"` " ante, at 407-408 (opinion of the Court)
            (quoting Medina v. California, 505 U. S. 437, 445-446 (1992), in turn quoting Patterson
            v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 202 (1977))&#x97;the execution of a legally and factually
            innocent person would be a constitutionally intolerable event. Dispositive to this case,
            however, is an equally fundamental fact: Petitioner is not innocent, in any sense of the
            word.</p>
         <p>As the Court explains, ante, at 398-400, petitioner is not innocent in the eyes of the
            law because, in our system of justice, "the trial is the paramount event for determining
            the guilt or innocence of the defendant," ante, at 416. Accord, post, at 441 (dissenting
            opinion). In petitioner's case, that paramount event occurred 10 years ago. He was tried
            before a jury of his peers, with the full panoply of protections that our Constitution
            affords criminal defendants. At the conclusion of that trial, the jury found petitioner
            guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Petitioner therefore does not appear before us as an
            innocent man on the verge of execution. He is instead a legally guilty one who, refusing
            to accept <span class="star-pagination">*420</span> the jury's verdict, demands a
            hearing in which to have his culpability determined once again. Ante, at 399-400.</p>
         <p>Consequently, the issue before us is not whether a State can execute the innocent. It
            is, as the Court notes, whether a fairly convicted and therefore legally guilty person
            is constitutionally entitled to yet another judicial proceeding in which to adjudicate
            his guilt anew, 10 years after conviction, notwithstanding his failure to demonstrate
            that constitutional error infected his trial. Ante, at 407, n. 6; see ante, at 399-400.
            In most circumstances, that question would answer itself in the negative. Our society
            has a high degree of confidence in its criminal trials, in no small part because the
            Constitution offers unparalleled protections against convicting the innocent. Ante, at
            398-399. The question similarly would be answered in the negative today, except for the
            disturbing nature of the claim before us. Petitioner contends not only that the
            Constitution's protections "sometimes fail," post, at 430 (dissenting opinion), but that
            their failure in his case will result in his execution &#x97; even though he is
            factually innocent and has evidence to prove it.</p>
         <p>Exercising restraint, the Court and Justice White assume for the sake of argument that,
            if a prisoner were to make an exceptionally strong showing of actual innocence, the
            execution could not go forward. Justice Blackmun, in contrast, would expressly so hold;
            he would also announce the precise burden of proof. Compare ante, at 417 (opinion of the
            Court) (We assume, "for the sake of argument in deciding this case, that in a capital
            case a truly persuasive demonstration of `actual innocence' made after trial would
            render the execution of a defendant unconstitutional and warrant federal habeas relief
            if there were no state avenue open to process such a claim"), and ante, at 429 (White,
            J., concurring in judgment) (assuming that a persuasive showing of actual innocence
            would render a conviction unconstitutional but explaining that, even under such an
            assumption, "petitioner would at the very least be required to show that based <span
               class="star-pagination">*421</span> on proffered newly discovered evidence and the
            entire record before the jury that convicted him, `no rational trier of fact could
            [find] proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.' Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 314
            (1979)"), with post, at 442 (dissenting opinion) ("I would hold that, to obtain relief
            on a claim of actual innocence, the petitioner must show that he probably is innocent").
            Resolving the issue is neither necessary nor advisable in this case. The question is a
            sensitive and, to say the least, troubling one. It implicates not just the life of a
            single individual, but also the State's powerful and legitimate interest in punishing
            the guilty, and the nature of state-federal relations. Indeed, as the Court persuasively
            demonstrates, ante, at 398-417, throughout our history the federal courts have assumed
            that they should not and could not intervene to prevent an execution so long as the
            prisoner had been convicted after a constitutionally adequate trial. The prisoner's sole
            remedy was a pardon or clemency.</p>
         <p>Nonetheless, the proper disposition of this case is neither difficult nor troubling. No
            matter what the Court might say about claims of actual innocence today, petitioner could
            not obtain relief. The record overwhelmingly demonstrates that petitioner deliberately
            shot and killed Officers Rucker and Carrisalez the night of September 29, 1981;
            petitioner's new evidence is bereft of credibility. Indeed, despite its stinging
            criticism of the Court's decision, not even the dissent expresses a belief that
            petitioner might possibly be actually innocent. Nor could it: The record makes it
            abundantly clear that petitioner is not somehow the future victim of "simple murder,"
            post, at 446 (dissenting opinion), but instead himself the established perpetrator of
            two brutal and tragic ones.</p>
         <p>Petitioner's first victim was Texas Department of Public Safety Officer David Rucker,
            whose body was found lying beside his patrol car. The body's condition indicated that a
            struggle had taken place and that Rucker had been shot in the head at rather close
            range. Petitioner's Social Security <span class="star-pagination">*422</span> card was
            found nearby. Shortly after Rucker's body was discovered, petitioner's second victim,
            Los Fresnos Police Officer Enrique Carrisalez, stopped a car speeding away from the
            murder scene. When Carrisalez approached, the driver shot him. Carrisalez lived long
            enough to identify petitioner as his assailant. Enrique Hernandez, a civilian who was
            riding with Carrisalez, also identified petitioner as the culprit. Moreover, at the time
            of the stop, Carrisalez radioed a description of the car and its license plates to the
            police station. The license plates corresponded to a car that petitioner was known to
            drive. Although the car belonged to petitioner's girlfriend, she did not have a set of
            keys; petitioner did. He even had a set in his pocket at the time of his arrest.</p>
         <p>When the police arrested petitioner, they found more than car keys; they also found
            evidence of the struggle between petitioner and Officer Rucker. Human blood was
            spattered across the hood, the left front fender, the grill, and the interior of
            petitioner's car. There were spots of blood on petitioner's jeans; blood had even
            managed to splash into his wallet. The blood was, like Rucker's and unlike petitioner's,
            type A. Blood samples also matched Rucker's enzyme profile. Only 6% of the Nation's
            population shares both Rucker's blood type and his enzyme profile.</p>
         <p>But the most compelling piece of evidence was entirely of petitioner's own making. When
            the police arrested petitioner, he had in his possession a signed letter in which he
            acknowledged responsibility for the murders; at the end of the letter, petitioner
            offered to turn himself in:</p> "`I am terribly sorry for those [to whom] I have brought
         grief . . . . What happened to Rucker was for a certain reason. . . . [H]e violated some of
         [the] laws [of my drug business] and suffered the penalty, like the one you have for me
         when the time comes. . . . The other officer [Carrisalez] . . . had not[hing] to do [with]
         this. He was out to do what he had to do, protect, but that's life. . . . [I]f <span
            class="star-pagination">*423</span> this is read word for word over the media, I will
         turn myself in . . . .' "Ante, at 395, n. 1. <p>There can be no doubt about the letter's
            meaning. When the police attempted to interrogate petitioner about the killings, he told
            them "`it was all in the letter' " and suggested that, if "they wanted to know what
            happened," they should read it. Herrera v. State, 682 S. W. 2d 313, 317 (Tex. Crim. App.
            1984), cert. denied, 471 U. S. 1131 (1985).</p>
         <p>Now, 10 years after being convicted on that seemingly dispositive evidence, petitioner
            has collected four affidavits that he claims prove his innocence. The affidavits allege
            that petitioner's brother, who died six years before the affidavits were executed, was
            the killer&#x97;and that petitioner was not. Affidavits like these are not uncommon,
            especially in capital cases. They are an unfortunate although understandable occurrence.
            It seems that, when a prisoner's life is at stake, he often can find someone new to
            vouch for him. Experience has shown, however, that such affidavits are to be treated
            with a fair degree of skepticism.</p>
         <p>These affidavits are no exception. They are suspect, produced as they were at the 11th
            hour with no reasonable explanation for the nearly decade-long delay. See ante, at
            417-418. Worse, they conveniently blame a dead man&#x97; someone who will neither
            contest the allegations nor suffer punishment as a result of them. Moreover, they
            contradict each other on numerous points, including the number of people in the
            murderer's car and the direction it was heading when Officer Carrisalez stopped it.
            Ante, at 418. They do not even agree on when Officer Rucker was killed. According to
            one, Rucker was killed when he and the murderer met at a highway rest stop. Brief for
            Petitioner 30. In contrast, another asserts that there was an initial meeting, but that
            Rucker was not killed until afterward when he "pulled [the murderer's car] over" on the
            highway. Id., at 27. And the affidavits are inconsistent with petitioner's own admission
            of guilt. The affidavits blame petitioner's deceased <span class="star-pagination"
               >*424</span> brother for both the Rucker and Carrisalez homicides&#x97;even though
            petitioner pleaded guilty to murdering Rucker and contested only the Carrisalez
            slaying.</p>
         <p>Most critical of all, however, the affidavits pale when compared to the proof at trial.
            While some bits of circumstantial evidence can be explained, petitioner offers no
            plausible excuse for the most damaging piece of evidence, the signed letter in which
            petitioner confessed and offered to turn himself in. One could hardly ask for more
            unimpeachable&#x97;or more unimpeached&#x97;evidence of guilt.</p>
         <p>The conclusion seems inescapable: Petitioner is guilty. The dissent does not contend
            otherwise. Instead, it urges us to defer to the District Court's determination that
            petitioner's evidence was not "so insubstantial that it could be dismissed without any
            hearing at all." Post, at 444. I do not read the District Court's decision as making any
            such determination. Nowhere in its opinion did the District Court question the accuracy
            of the jury's verdict. Nor did it pass on the sufficiency of the affidavits. The
            District Court did not even suggest that it wished to hold an evidentiary hearing on
            petitioner's actual innocence claims. Indeed, the District Court apparently believed
            that a hearing would be futile because the court could offer no relief in any event. As
            the court explained, claims of "newly discovered evidence bearing directly upon guilt or
            innocence" are not cognizable on habeas corpus "unless the petition implicates a
            constitutional violation." App. 38.</p>
         <p>As the dissent admits, post, at 444, the District Court had an altogether different
            reason for entering a stay of execution. It believed, from a "sense of fairness and due
            process," App. 38, that petitioner should have the chance to present his affidavits to
            the state courts. Id., at 38-39; ante, at 397. But the District Court did not hold that
            the state courts should hold a hearing either; it instead ordered the habeas petition
            dismissed and the stay lifted once the state court action was filed, without further
            condition. App. 39. As <span class="star-pagination">*425</span> the Court of Appeals
            recognized, that rationale was insufficient to support the stay order. Texas courts do
            not recognize new evidence claims on collateral review. Id., at 67-68. Nor would they
            entertain petitioner's claim as a motion for a new trial; under Texas law, such motions
            must be made within 30 days of trial. See ante, at 400, 410; App. 68. Because petitioner
            could not have obtained relief&#x97;or even a hearing&#x97;through the state courts, it
            was error for the District Court to enter a stay permitting him to try.</p>
         <p>Of course, the Texas courts would not be free to turn petitioner away if the
            Constitution required otherwise. But the District Court did not hold that the
            Constitution required them to entertain petitioner's claim. On these facts, that would
            be an extraordinary holding. Petitioner did not raise his claim shortly after Texas'
            30-day limit expired; he raised it eight years too late. Consequently, the District
            Court would have had to conclude not that Texas' 30-day limit for new evidence claims
            was too short to comport with due process, but that applying an 8-year limit to
            petitioner would be. As the Court demonstrates today, see ante, at 408-411, there is
            little in fairness or history to support such a conclusion.</p>
         <p>But even if the District Court did hold that further federal proceedings were warranted,
            surely it abused its discretion. The affidavits do not reveal a likelihood of actual
            innocence. See ante, at 393-395, 417-419; supra, at 423-427. In-person repetition of the
            affiants' accounts at an evidentiary hearing could not alter that; the accounts are, on
            their face and when compared to the proof at trial, unconvincing. As a result, further
            proceedings were improper even under the rather lax standard the dissent urges, for "`it
            plainly appear[ed] from the face of the petition and [the] exhibits annexed to it that
            the petitioner [wa]s not entitled to relief.' " Post, at 445 (quoting 28 U. S. C. § 2254
            Rule 4).</p>
         <p>The abuse of discretion is particularly egregious given the procedural posture. The
            District Court actually entered an order staying the execution. Such stays on "second or
            successive <span class="star-pagination">*426</span> federal habeas petition[s] should
            be granted only when there are `substantial grounds upon which relief might be granted,'
            " Delo v. Stokes, 495 U. S. 320, 321 (1990) (quoting Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880,
            895 (1983)), and only when the equities favor the petitioner, see Gomez v. United States
            Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 503 U. S. 653, 654 (1992) (Whether a claim is
            framed "as a habeas petition or as a [42 U. S. C.] § 1983 action, [what is sought is] an
            equitable remedy. . . . A court may consider the last-minute nature of an application to
            stay execution in deciding whether to grant equitable relief"). Petitioner's claim
            satisfied neither condition. The grounds petitioner offered in his habeas petition were
            anything but substantial. And the equities favored the State. Petitioner delayed
            presenting his new evidence until eight years after conviction&#x97;without offering a
            semblance of a reasonable excuse for the inordinate delay. At some point in time, the
            State's interest in finality must outweigh the prisoner's interest in yet another round
            of litigation. In this case, that point was well short of eight years.</p>
         <p>Unless federal proceedings and relief&#x97;if they are to be had at all&#x97;are
            reserved for "extraordinarily high" and "truly persuasive demonstration[s] of `actual
            innocence' " that cannot be presented to state authorities, ante, at 417, the federal
            courts will be deluged with frivolous claims of actual innocence. Justice Jackson
            explained the dangers of such circumstances some 40 years ago:</p> "It must prejudice
         the occasional meritorious application to be buried in a flood of worthless ones. He who
         must search a haystack for a needle is likely to end up with the attitude that the needle
         is not worth the search." Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 537 (1953) (concurring in result).
            <p>If the federal courts are to entertain claims of actual innocence, their attention,
            efforts, and energy must be reserved <span class="star-pagination">*427</span> for the
            truly extraordinary case; they ought not be forced to sort through the insubstantial and
            the incredible as well.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>* * *</h2>
         <p>Ultimately, two things about this case are clear. First is what the Court does not hold.
            Nowhere does the Court state that the Constitution permits the execution of an actually
            innocent person. Instead, the Court assumes for the sake of argument that a truly
            persuasive demonstration of actual innocence would render any such execution
            unconstitutional and that federal habeas relief would be warranted if no state avenue
            were open to process the claim. Second is what petitioner has not demonstrated.
            Petitioner has failed to make a persuasive showing of actual innocence. Not one
            judge&#x97;no state court judge, not the District Court Judge, none of the three judges
            of the Court of Appeals, and none of the Justices of this Court&#x97;has expressed doubt
            about petitioner's guilt. Accordingly, the Court has no reason to pass on, and
            appropriately reserves, the question whether federal courts may entertain convincing
            claims of actual innocence. That difficult question remains open. If the Constitution's
            guarantees of fair procedure and the safeguards of clemency and pardon fulfill their
            historical mission, it may never require resolution at all.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="concurrence" judge="scalia">
         <p>Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring.</p>
         <p>We granted certiorari on the question whether it violates due process or constitutes
            cruel and unusual punishment for a State to execute a person who, having been convicted
            of murder after a full and fair trial, later alleges that newly discovered evidence
            shows him to be "actually innocent." I would have preferred to decide that question,
            particularly since, as the Court's discussion shows, it is perfectly clear what the
            answer is: There is no basis in text, tradition, or even in contemporary practice (if
            that were enough) for finding <span class="star-pagination">*428</span> in the
            Constitution a right to demand judicial consideration of newly discovered evidence of
            innocence brought forward after conviction. In saying that such a right exists, the
            dissenters apply nothing but their personal opinions to invalidate the rules of more
            than two-thirds of the States, and a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure for which this
            Court itself is responsible. If the system that has been in place for 200 years (and
            remains widely approved) "shock[s]" the dissenters' consciences, post, at 430, perhaps
            they should doubt the calibration of their consciences, or, better still, the usefulness
            of "conscience shocking" as a legal test.</p>
         <p>I nonetheless join the entirety of the Court's opinion, including the final portion,
            ante, at 417-419&#x97;because there is no legal error in deciding a case by assuming,
            arguendo, that an asserted constitutional right exists, and because I can understand, or
            at least am accustomed to, the reluctance of the present Court to admit publicly that
            Our Perfect Constitution<span class="sup">[*]</span> lets stand any injustice, much less
            the execution of an innocent man who has received, though to no avail, all the process
            that our society has traditionally deemed adequate. With any luck, we shall avoid ever
            having to face this embarrassing question again, since it is improbable that evidence of
            innocence as convincing as today's opinion requires would fail to produce an executive
            pardon.</p>
         <p>My concern is that in making life easier for ourselves we not appear to make it harder
            for the lower federal courts, imposing upon them the burden of regularly analyzing
            newly-discovered-evidence-of-innocence claims in capital cases (in which event such
            federal claims, it can confidently be predicted, will become routine and even
            repetitive). A number of Courts of Appeals have hitherto held, largely in <span
               class="star-pagination">*429</span> reliance on our unelaborated statement in
            Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 317 (1963), that newly discovered evidence relevant
            only to a state prisoner's guilt or innocence is not a basis for federal habeas corpus
            relief. See, e. g., Boyd v. Puckett, 905 F. 2d 895, 896-897 (CA5), cert. denied, 498 U.
            S. 988 (1990); Stockton v. Virginia, 852 F. 2d 740, 749 (CA4 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.
            S. 1071 (1989); Swindle v. Davis, 846 F. 2d 706, 707 (CA11 1988) (per curiam); Byrd v.
            Armontrout, 880 F. 2d 1, 8 (CA8 1989), cert. denied, 494 U. S. 1019 (1990); Burks v.
            Egeler, 512 F. 2d 221, 230 (CA6), cert. denied, 423 U. S. 937 (1975). I do not
            understand it to be the import of today's decision that those holdings are to be
            replaced with a strange regime that assumes permanently, though only "arguendo, " that a
            constitutional right exists, and expends substantial judicial resources on that
            assumption. The Court's extensive and scholarly discussion of the question presented in
            the present case does nothing but support our statement in Townsend and strengthen the
            validity of the holdings based upon it.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="concurrence" judge="white"><p>Justice White, concurring in the judgment.</p>
         <p>In voting to affirm, I assume that a persuasive showing of "actual innocence" made after
            trial, even though made after the expiration of the time provided by law for the
            presentation of newly discovered evidence, would render unconstitutional the execution
            of petitioner in this case. To be entitled to relief, however, petitioner would at the
            very least be required to show that based on proffered newly discovered evidence and the
            entire record before the jury that convicted him, "no rational trier of fact could
            [find] proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt." Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307,
            324 (1979). For the reasons stated in the Court's opinion, petitioner's showing falls
            far short of satisfying even that standard, and I therefore concur in the judgment.</p>

      <div type="dissent" judge="blackmun">

            <span class="star-pagination">*430</span> Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Stevens
            and Justice Souter join with respect to Parts I&#x97;IV, dissenting.</p>
         <p>Nothing could be more contrary to contemporary standards of decency, see Ford v.
            Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 406 (1986), or more shocking to the conscience, see Rochin v.
            California, 342 U. S. 165, 172 (1952), than to execute a person who is actually
            innocent.</p>
         <p>I therefore must disagree with the long and general discussion that precedes the Court's
            disposition of this case. See ante, at 398-417. That discussion, of course, is dictum
            because the Court assumes, "for the sake of argument in deciding this case, that in a
            capital case a truly persuasive demonstration of `actual innocence' made after trial
            would render the execution of a defendant unconstitutional." Ante, at 417. Without
            articulating the standard it is applying, however, the Court then decides that this
            petitioner has not made a sufficiently persuasive case. Because I believe that in the
            first instance the District Court should decide whether petitioner is entitled to a
            hearing and whether he is entitled to relief on the merits of his claim, I would reverse
            the order of the Court of Appeals and remand this case for further proceedings in the
            District Court.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>I</h2>
         <p>The Court's enumeration, ante, at 398-399, of the constitutional rights of criminal
            defendants surely is entirely beside the point. These protections sometimes fail.<span
               class="sup">[1]</span> We really <span class="star-pagination">*431</span> are being
            asked to decide whether the Constitution forbids the execution of a person who has been
            validly convicted and sentenced but who, nonetheless, can prove his innocence with newly
            discovered evidence. Despite the State of Texas' astonishing protestation to the
            contrary, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 37, I do not see how the answer can be anything but
            "yes."</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>The Eighth Amendment prohibits "cruel and unusual punishments." This proscription is not
            static but rather reflects evolving standards of decency. Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S.,
            at 406; Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 171 (1976) (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and
            Stevens, JJ.); Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion); Weems v.
            United States, 217 U. S. 349, 373 (1910). I think it is crystal clear that the execution
            of an innocent person is "at odds with contemporary standards of fairness and decency."
            Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 465 (1984). Indeed, it is at odds with any standard
            of decency that I can imagine.</p>
         <p>This Court has ruled that punishment is excessive and unconstitutional if it is "nothing
            more than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering," or if it is
            "grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime." Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S.
            584, 592 (1977) (plurality opinion); Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S., at 173 (opinion of
            Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). It has held that death is an excessive punishment
            for rape, Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S., at 592, and for mere participation in a robbery
            during which a killing takes place, Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, 797 (1982). If it
            is violative of the Eighth Amendment to execute someone who is guilty of those crimes,
            then it plainly is violative of the Eighth Amendment to execute a person who is actually
            innocent. Executing an innocent person epitomizes "the <span class="star-pagination"
               >*432</span> purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering." Coker v.
            Georgia, 433 U. S., at 592.<span class="sup">[2]</span>
         </p>
         <p>The protection of the Eighth Amendment does not end once a defendant has been validly
            convicted and sentenced. In Johnson v. Mississippi, 486 U. S. 578 (1988), the petitioner
            had been convicted of murder and sentenced to death on the basis of three aggravating
            circumstances. One of those circumstances was that he previously had been convicted of a
            violent felony in the State of New York. After Johnson had been sentenced to death, the
            New York Court of Appeals reversed his prior conviction. Although there was no question
            that the prior conviction was valid at the time of Johnson's sentencing, this Court held
            that the Eighth Amendment required review of the sentence because "the jury was allowed
            to consider evidence that has been revealed to be materially inaccurate." Id., at
               590.<span class="sup">[3]</span> In Ford v. Wainwright, the petitioner had been
            convicted of murder and sentenced <span class="star-pagination">*433</span> to death.
            There was no suggestion that he was incompetent at the time of his offense, at trial, or
            at sentencing, but subsequently he exhibited changes in behavior that raised doubts
            about his sanity. This Court held that Florida was required under the Eighth Amendment
            to provide an additional hearing to determine whether Ford was mentally competent, and
            that he could not be executed if he were incompetent. 477 U. S., at 410 (plurality
            opinion); id., at 422-423 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
            Both Johnson and Ford recognize that capital defendants may be entitled to further
            proceedings because of an intervening development even though they have been validly
            convicted and sentenced to death.</p>
         <p>Respondent and the United States as amicus curiae argue that the Eighth Amendment does
            not apply to petitioner because he is challenging his guilt, not his punishment. Brief
            for Respondent 21-23; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9-12. The majority
            attempts to distinguish Ford on that basis. Ante, at 405-406.<span class="sup"
               >[4]</span> Such reasoning, however, not only contradicts our decision in Beck v.
            Alabama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980), but also fundamentally misconceives the nature of
            petitioner's argument. Whether petitioner is viewed as challenging simply his death
            sentence or also his continued detention, he still is challenging the State's right to
            punish him. Respondent and the United States would impose a clear line between guilt and
            punishment, reasoning that every claim that concerns guilt necessarily does not involve
            punishment. Such a division is far too facile. What respondent and the United States
            fail to recognize is that the <span class="star-pagination">*434</span> legitimacy of
            punishment is inextricably intertwined with guilt.</p>
         <p>Beck makes this clear. In Beck, the petitioner was convicted of the capital crime of
            robbery-intentional killing. Under Alabama law, however, the trial court was prohibited
            from giving the jury the option of convicting him of the lesser included offense of
            felony murder. We held that precluding the instruction injected an impermissible element
            of uncertainty into the guilt phase of the trial.</p> "To insure that the death penalty
         is indeed imposed on the basis of `reason rather than caprice or emotion,' we have
         invalidated procedural rules that tended to diminish the reliability of the sentencing
         determination. The same reasoning must apply to rules that diminish the reliability of the
         guilt determination. Thus, if the unavailability of a lesser included offense instruction
         enhances the risk of an unwarranted conviction, [the State] is constitutionally prohibited
         from withdrawing that option in a capital case." Id., at 638 (footnote omitted). <p>The
            decision in Beck establishes that, at least in capital cases, the Eighth Amendment
            requires more than reliability in sentencing. It also mandates a reliable determination
            of guilt. See also Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S., at 456.</p>
         <p>The Court also suggests that allowing petitioner to raise his claim of innocence would
            not serve society's interest in the reliable imposition of the death penalty because it
            might require a new trial that would be less accurate than the first. Ante, at 403-404.
            This suggestion misses the point entirely. The question is not whether a second trial
            would be more reliable than the first but whether, in light of new evidence, the result
            of the first trial is sufficiently reliable for the State to carry out a death sentence.
            Furthermore, it is far from clear that a State will seek to retry the rare prisoner who
            prevails on a claim of actual innocence. As explained in Part III, infra, I believe a
            prisoner must show not just that there <span class="star-pagination">*435</span> was
            probably a reasonable doubt about his guilt but that he is probably actually innocent. I
            find it difficult to believe that any State would choose to retry a person who meets
            this standard.</p>
         <p>I believe it contrary to any standard of decency to execute someone who is actually
            innocent. Because the Eighth Amendment applies to questions of guilt or innocence, Beck
            v. Alabama, 447 U. S., at 638, and to persons upon whom a valid sentence of death has
            been imposed, Johnson v. Mississippi, 486 U. S., at 590, I also believe that petitioner
            may raise an Eighth Amendment challenge to his punishment on the ground that he is
            actually innocent.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B</h2>
         <p>Execution of the innocent is equally offensive to the Due Process Clause of the
            Fourteenth Amendment. The majority's discussion misinterprets petitioner's Fourteenth
            Amendment claim as raising a procedural, rather than a substantive, due process
               challenge.<span class="sup">[5]</span>
         </p> "The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that `No person shall . . . be
         deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . .' This Court has
         held that the Due Process Clause protects individuals against two types of government
         action. So-called `substantive due process' prevents the <span class="star-pagination"
            >*436</span> government from engaging in conduct that `shocks the conscience,' Rochin v.
         California, 342 U. S. 165, 172 (1952), or interferes with rights `implicit in the concept
         of ordered liberty,' Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325-326 (1937). When government
         action depriving a person of life, liberty, or property survives substantive due process
         scrutiny, it must still be implemented in a fair manner. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S.
         319, 335 (1976). This requirement has traditionally been referred to as `procedural' due
         process." United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 746 (1987). <p>Petitioner cites not
            Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976), or Medina v. California, 505 U. S. 437
            (1992), in support of his due process claim, but Rochin. Brief for Petitioner 32-33.</p>
         <p>Just last Term, we had occasion to explain the role of substantive due process in our
            constitutional scheme. Quoting the second Justice Harlan, we said:</p> "`[T]he full
         scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by
         the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This
         "liberty" is not a series of isolated points . . . . It is a rational continuum which,
         broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and
         purposeless restraints . . . .' " Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.
         S. 833, 848 (1992), quoting Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S. 497, 543 (1961) (opinion dissenting
         from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds). <p>Petitioner's claim falls within our due
            process precedents. In Rochin, deputy sheriffs investigating narcotics sales broke into
            Rochin's room and observed him put two capsules in his mouth. The deputies attempted to
            remove the capsules from his mouth and, having failed, took Rochin to a hospital and had
            his stomach pumped. The capsules were <span class="star-pagination">*437</span> found to
            contain morphine. The Court held that the deputies' conduct "shock[ed] the conscience"
            and violated due process. 342 U. S., at 172. "Illegally breaking into the privacy of the
            petitioner, the struggle to open his mouth and remove what was there, the forcible
            extraction of his stomach's contents&#x97;this course of proceeding by agents of
            government to obtain evidence is bound to offend even hardened sensibilities. They are
            methods too close to the rack and the screw to permit of constitutional
            differentiation." Ibid. The lethal injection that petitioner faces as an allegedly
            innocent person is certainly closer to the rack and the screw than the stomach pump
            condemned in Rochin. Execution of an innocent person is the ultimate "`arbitrary
            impositio[n].' " Planned Parenthood, 505 U. S., at 848. It is an imposition from which
            one never recovers and for which one can never be compensated. Thus, I also believe that
            petitioner may raise a substantive due process challenge to his punishment on the ground
            that he is actually innocent.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>C</h2>
         <p>Given my conclusion that it violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to execute a
            person who is actually innocent, I find no bar in Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293
            (1963), to consideration of an actual-innocence claim. Newly discovered evidence of
            petitioner's innocence does bear on the constitutionality of his execution. Of course,
            it could be argued this is in some tension with Townsend `s statement, id., at 317, that
            "the existence merely of newly discovered evidence relevant to the guilt of a state
            prisoner is not a ground for relief on federal habeas corpus." That statement, however,
            is no more than distant dictum here, for we never had been asked to consider whether the
            execution of an innocent person violates the Constitution.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>II</h2>
         <p>The majority's discussion of petitioner's constitutional claims is even more perverse
            when viewed in the light of this <span class="star-pagination">*438</span> Court's
            recent habeas jurisprudence. Beginning with a trio of decisions in 1986, this Court
            shifted the focus of federal habeas review of successive, abusive, or defaulted claims
            away from the preservation of constitutional rights to a factbased inquiry into the
            habeas petitioner's guilt or innocence. See Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S. 436, 454
            (plurality opinion); Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 496; Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S.
            527, 537; see also McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 493-494 (1991). The Court sought to
            strike a balance between the State's interest in the finality of its criminal judgments
            and the prisoner's interest in access to a forum to test the basic justice of his
            sentence. Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S., at 452. In striking this balance, the Court
            adopted the view of Judge Friendly that there should be an exception to the concept of
            finality when a prisoner can make a colorable claim of actual innocence. Friendly, Is
            Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Criminal Judgments, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 142,
            160 (1970).</p>
         <p>Justice Powell, writing for the plurality in Wilson, explained the reason for focusing
            on innocence:</p> "The prisoner may have a vital interest in having a second chance to
         test the fundamental justice of his incarceration. Even where, as here, the many judges who
         have reviewed the prisoner's claims in several proceedings provided by the State and on his
         first petition for federal habeas corpus have determined that his trial was free from
         constitutional error, a prisoner retains a powerful and legitimate interest in obtaining
         his release from custody if he is innocent of the charge for which he was incarcerated.
         That interest does not extend, however, to prisoners whose guilt is conceded or plain." 477
         U. S., at 452. <p>In other words, even a prisoner who appears to have had a
            constitutionally perfect trial "retains a powerful and legitimate interest in obtaining
            his release from custody if he is <span class="star-pagination">*439</span> innocent of
            the charge for which he was incarcerated." It is obvious that this reasoning extends
            beyond the context of successive, abusive, or defaulted claims to substantive claims of
            actual innocence. Indeed, Judge Friendly recognized that substantive claims of actual
            innocence should be cognizable on federal habeas. 38 U. Chi. L. Rev., at 159-160, and n.
            87.</p>
         <p>Having adopted an "actual-innocence" requirement for review of abusive, successive, or
            defaulted claims, however, the majority would now take the position that "a claim of
            `actual innocence' is not itself a constitutional claim, but instead a gateway through
            which a habeas petitioner must pass to have his otherwise barred constitutional claim
            considered on the merits." Ante, at 404. In other words, having held that a prisoner who
            is incarcerated in violation of the Constitution must show he is actually innocent to
            obtain relief, the majority would now hold that a prisoner who is actually innocent must
            show a constitutional violation to obtain relief. The only principle that would appear
            to reconcile these two positions is the principle that habeas relief should be denied
            whenever possible.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>III</h2>
         <p>The Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, of course, are binding on the States, and one
            would normally expect the States to adopt procedures to consider claims of actual
            innocence based on newly discovered evidence. See Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S., at
            411-417 (plurality opinion) (minimum requirements for state-court proceeding to
            determine competency to be executed). The majority's disposition of this case, however,
            leaves the States uncertain of their constitutional obligations.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>A</h2>
         <p>Whatever procedures a State might adopt to hear actualinnocence claims, one thing is
            certain: The possibility of executive clemency is not sufficient to satisfy the
            requirements of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The majority <span
               class="star-pagination">*440</span> correctly points out: "`A pardon is an act of
            grace.' " Ante, at 413. The vindication of rights guaranteed by the Constitution has
            never been made to turn on the unreviewable discretion of an executive official or
            administrative tribunal. Indeed, in Ford v. Wainwright, we explicitly rejected the
            argument that executive clemency was adequate to vindicate the Eighth Amendment right
            not to be executed if one is insane. 477 U. S., at 416. The possibility of executive
            clemency "exists in every case in which a defendant challenges his sentence under the
            Eighth Amendment. Recognition of such a bare possibility would make judicial review
            under the Eighth Amendment meaningless." Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 303 (1983).</p>
         <p>"The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws,
            and not of men. It will certainly cease to deserve this high appellation, if the laws
            furnish no remedy for the violation of a vested legal right." Marbury v. Madison, 1
            Cranch 137, 163 (1803). If the exercise of a legal right turns on "an act of grace,"
            then we no longer live under a government of laws. "The very purpose of a Bill of Rights
            was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to
            place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal
            principles to be applied by the courts." West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S.
            624, 638 (1943). It is understandable, therefore, that the majority does not say that
            the vindication of petitioner's constitutional rights may be left to executive
            clemency.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>B</h2>
         <p>Like other constitutional claims, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims of actual
            innocence advanced on behalf of a state prisoner can and should be heard in state court.
            If a State provides a judicial procedure for raising such claims, the prisoner may be
            required to exhaust that procedure before taking his claim of actual innocence to
            federal court. See 28 U. S. C. §§ 2254(b) and (c). Furthermore, state-court <span
               class="star-pagination">*441</span> determinations of factual issues relating to the
            claim would be entitled to a presumption of correctness in any subsequent federal habeas
            proceeding. See § 2254(d).</p>
         <p>Texas provides no judicial procedure for hearing petitioner's claim of actual innocence
            and his habeas petition was properly filed in district court under § 2254. The district
            court is entitled to dismiss the petition summarily only if "it plainly appears from the
            face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is not entitled
            to relief." § 2254 Rule 4. If, as is the case here, the petition raises factual
            questions and the State has failed to provide a full and fair hearing, the district
            court is required to hold an evidentiary hearing. Townsend v.Sain, 372 U. S., at
            313.</p>
         <p>Because the present federal petition is petitioner's second, he must either show cause
            for, and prejudice from, failing to raise the claim in his first petition or show that
            he falls within the "actual-innocence" exception to the cause and prejudice requirement.
            McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S., at 494-495. If petitioner can show that he is entitled to
            relief on the merits of his actual-innocence claim, however, he certainly can show that
            he falls within the "actual-innocence" exception to the cause and prejudice requirement
            and McCleskey would not bar relief.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>C</h2>
         <p>The question that remains is what showing should be required to obtain relief on the
            merits of an Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment claim of actual innocence. I agree with the
            majority that "in state criminal proceedings the trial is the paramount event for
            determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant." Ante, at 416. I also think that "a
            truly persuasive demonstration of `actual innocence' made after trial would render the
            execution of a defendant unconstitutional." Ante, at 417. The question is what "a truly
            persuasive demonstration" entails, a question the majority's disposition of this case
            leaves open.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*442</span> In articulating the "actual-innocence"
            exception in our habeas jurisprudence, this Court has adopted a standard requiring the
            petitioner to show a "`fair probability that, in light of all the evidence . . . , the
            trier of the facts would have entertained a reasonable doubt of his guilt.' " Kuhlmann
            v. Wilson, 477 U. S., at 455, n. 17. In other words, the habeas petitioner must show
            that there probably would be a reasonable doubt. See also Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S.,
            at 496 (exception applies when a constitutional violation has "probably resulted" in a
            mistaken conviction); McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S., at 494 (exception applies when a
            constitutional violation "probably has caused" a mistaken conviction).<span class="sup"
               >[6]</span>
         </p>
         <p>I think the standard for relief on the merits of an actualinnocence claim must be higher
            than the threshold standard for merely reaching that claim or any other claim that has
            been procedurally defaulted or is successive or abusive. I would hold that, to obtain
            relief on a claim of actual innocence, the petitioner must show that he probably is
            innocent. This standard is supported by several considerations. First, new evidence of
            innocence may be discovered long after the defendant's conviction. Given the passage of
            time, it may <span class="star-pagination">*443</span> be difficult for the State to
            retry a defendant who obtains relief from his conviction or sentence on an
            actual-innocence claim. The actual-innocence proceeding thus may constitute the final
            word on whether the defendant may be punished. In light of this fact, an otherwise
            constitutionally valid conviction or sentence should not be set aside lightly. Second,
            conviction after a constitutionally adequate trial strips the defendant of the
            presumption of innocence. The government bears the burden of proving the defendant's
            guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 315 (1979); In re
            Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970), but once the government has done so, the burden of
            proving innocence must shift to the convicted defendant. The actual-innocence inquiry is
            therefore distinguishable from review for sufficiency of the evidence, where the
            question is not whether the defendant is innocent but whether the government has met its
            constitutional burden of proving the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. When a
            defendant seeks to challenge the determination of guilt after he has been validly
            convicted and sentenced, it is fair to place on him the burden of proving his innocence,
            not just raising doubt about his guilt.</p>
         <p>In considering whether a prisoner is entitled to relief on an actual-innocence claim, a
            court should take all the evidence into account, giving due regard to its reliability.
            See Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S., at 339, n. 5 (1992); Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S., at
            455, n. 17; Friendly, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev., at 160. Because placing the burden on the
            prisoner to prove innocence creates a presumption that the conviction is valid, it is
            not necessary or appropriate to make further presumptions about the reliability of newly
            discovered evidence generally. Rather, the court charged with deciding such a claim
            should make a case-by-case determination about the reliability of the newly discovered
            evidence under the circumstances. The court then should weigh the evidence in favor of
            the prisoner against the evidence of his guilt. <span class="star-pagination"
               >*444</span> Obviously, the stronger the evidence of the prisoner's guilt, the more
            persuasive the newly discovered evidence of innocence must be. A prisoner raising an
            actual-innocence claim in a federal habeas petition is not entitled to discovery as a
            matter of right. Harris v. Nelson, 394 U. S. 286, 295 (1969); 28 U. S. C. § 2254 Rule 6.
            The district court retains discretion to order discovery, however, when it would help
            the court make a reliable determination with respect to the prisoner's claim. Harris v.
            Nelson, 394 U. S., at 299-300; see Advisory Committee Note on Rule 6, 28 U. S. C., pp.
            421-422.</p>
         <p>It should be clear that the standard I would adopt would not convert the federal courts
            into "`forums in which to relitigate state trials.' " Ante, at 401, quoting Barefoot v.
            Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 887 (1983). It would not "require the habeas court to hear
            testimony from the witnesses who testified at trial," ante, at 402, though, if the
            petition warrants a hearing, it may require the habeas court to hear the testimony of
            "those who made the statements in the affidavits which petitioner has presented." Ibid.
            I believe that if a prisoner can show that he is probably actually innocent, in light of
            all the evidence, then he has made "a truly persuasive demonstration," ante, at 417, and
            his execution would violate the Constitution. I would so hold.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>IV</h2>
         <p>In this case, the District Court determined that petitioner's newly discovered evidence
            warranted further consideration. Because the District Court doubted its own authority to
            consider the new evidence, it thought that petitioner's claim of actual innocence should
            be brought in state court, see App. 38-39, but it clearly did not think that
            petitioner's evidence was so insubstantial that it could be dismissed without any
            hearing at all.<span class="sup">[7]</span> I would reverse the order of the <span
               class="star-pagination">*445</span> Court of Appeals and remand the case to the
            District Court to consider whether petitioner has shown, in light of all the evidence,
            that he is probably actually innocent.</p>
         <p>I think it is unwise for this Court to step into the shoes of a district court and rule
            on this petition in the first instance. If this Court wishes to act as a district court,
            however, it must also be bound by the rules that govern consideration of habeas
            petitions in district court. A district court may summarily dismiss a habeas petition
            only if"it plainly appears from the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it
            that the petitioner is not entitled to relief." 28 U. S. C. § 2254 Rule 4. In one of the
            affidavits, Hector Villarreal, a licensed attorney and former state court judge, swears
            under penalty of perjury that his client Raul Herrera, Sr., confessed that he, and not
            petitioner, committed the murders. No matter what the majority may think of the
            inconsistencies in the affidavits or the strength of the evidence presented at trial,
            this affidavit alone is sufficient to raise factual questions concerning petitioner's
            innocence that cannot be resolved simply by examining the affidavits and the
            petition.</p>
         <p>I do not understand why the majority so severely faults petitioner for relying only on
            affidavits. Ante, at 417. It is common to rely on affidavits at the
            preliminary-consideration stage of a habeas proceeding. The opportunity for
            crossexamination and credibility determinations comes at the hearing, assuming that the
            petitioner is entitled to one. It makes no sense for this Court to impugn the
            reliability of petitioner's evidence on the ground that its credibility has not been
            tested when the reason its credibility has not been tested is that petitioner's habeas
            proceeding has been truncated by the Court of Appeals and now by this Court. In its
            haste to deny petitioner relief, the majority seems to confuse the question whether the
            petition may be dismissed <span class="star-pagination">*446</span> summarily with the
            question whether petitioner is entitled to relief on the merits of his claim.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>V</h2>
         <p>I have voiced disappointment over this Court's obvious eagerness to do away with any
            restriction on the States' power to execute whomever and however they please. See
            Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 758-759 (1991) (dissenting opinion). See also
            Coleman v. Thompson, 504 U. S. 188, 189 (1992) (dissent from denial of stay of
            execution). I have also expressed doubts about whether, in the absence of such
            restrictions, capital punishment remains constitutional at all. Sawyer v. Whitley, 505
            U. S., at 343-345 (opinion concurring in judgment). Of one thing, however, I am certain.
            Just as an execution without adequate safeguards is unacceptable, so too is an execution
            when the condemned prisoner can prove that he is innocent. The execution of a person who
            can show that he is innocent comes perilously close to simple murder.</p>

         <p>[2] Villarreal's affidavit is dated December 11, 1990. He attested that while he was
            representing Raul, Senior, on a charge of attempted murder in 1984, Raul, Senior, had
            told him that he, petitioner, their father, Officer Rucker, and the Hidalgo County
            Sheriff were involved in a drugtrafficking scheme; that he was the one who had shot
            Officers Rucker and Carrisalez; that he did not tell anyone about this because he
            thought petitioner would be acquitted; and that after petitioner was convicted and
            sentenced to death, he began blackmailing the Hidalgo County Sheriff. According to
            Villarreal, Raul, Senior, was killed by Jose Lopez, who worked with the sheriff on
            drug-trafficking matters and was present when Raul, Senior, murdered Rucker and
            Carrisalez, to silence him. </p>
         <p>Palacious' affidavit is dated December 10, 1990. He attested that while he and Raul,
            Senior, shared a cell together in the Hidalgo County jail in 1984, Raul, Senior, told
            him that he had shot Rucker and Carrisalez.</p>
         <p>[3] Raul, Junior's affidavit is dated January 29, 1992. Ybarra's affidavit is dated
            January 9, 1991. It was initially submitted with Petitioner's Reply to State's Brief in
            Response to Petitioner's Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus filed January 18, 1991, in
            the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>
         <p>[4] After the Court of Appeals vacated the stay of execution, petitioner attached a new
            affidavit by Raul, Junior, to his petition for rehearing, which was denied. The
            affidavit alleges that during petitioner's trial, various law enforcement officials and
            the Hidalgo County Sheriff told Raul, Junior, not to say what happened on the night of
            the shootings and threatened his family.</p>
         <p>[5] The dissent relies on Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980), for the proposition
            that, "at least in capital cases, the Eighth Amendment requires more than reliability in
            sentencing. It also mandates a reliable determination of guilt." Post, at 434. To the
            extent Beck rests on Eighth Amendment grounds, it simply emphasizes the importance of
            ensuring the reliability of the guilt determination in capital cases in the first
            instance. We have difficulty extending this principle to hold that a capital defendant
            who has been afforded a full and fair trial may challenge his conviction on federal
            habeas based on after-discovered evidence.</p>
         <p>[6] The dissent takes us to task for examining petitioner's Fourteenth Amendment claim
            in terms of procedural, rather than substantive, due process. Because "[e]xecution of an
            innocent person is the ultimate `arbitrary impositio[n],' " post, at 437, quoting
            Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 848 (1992) (internal
            quotation marks omitted), the dissent concludes that "petitioner may raise a substantive
            due process challenge to his punishment on the ground that he is actually innocent,"
            post, at 437. But the dissent puts the cart before the horse. For its due process
            analysis rests on the assumption that petitioner is in fact innocent. However, as we
            have discussed, petitioner does not come before this Court as an innocent man, but
            rather as one who has been convicted by due process of law of two capital murders. The
            question before us, then, is not whether due process prohibits the execution of an
            innocent person, but rather whether it entitles petitioner to judicial review of his
            "actual innocence" claim. This issue is properly analyzed only in terms of procedural
            due process.</p>
         <p>[7] In response to the second preliminary draft of the Federal Rules of Criminal
            Procedure, Chief Justice Harlan Stone forwarded a memorandum on behalf of the Court to
            the Rules Advisory Committee with various comments and suggestions, including the
            following: "It is suggested that there should be a definite time limit within which
            motions for new trial based on newly discovered evidence should be made, unless the
            trial court in its discretion, for good cause shown, allows the motion to be filed. Is
            it not desirable that at some point of time further consideration of criminal cases by
            the court should be at an end, after which appeals should be made to Executive clemency
            alone?" 7 Drafting History of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 3, 7 (M. Wilken
            &amp;amp; N. Triffin eds. 1991) (responding to proposed Rule 35). As noted above, we
            eventually rejected the adoption of a flexible time limit for new trial motions, opting
            instead for a strict 2-year time limit.</p>

         <p>[12] The term "clemency" refers not only to full or conditional pardons, but also
            commutations, remissions of fines, and reprieves. See Kobil, The Quality of Mercy
            Strained: Wresting the Pardoning Power from the King, 69 Texas L. Rev. 569, 575-578
            (1991).</p>
         <p>[13] The dissent relies on the plurality opinion in Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399
            (1986), to support the proposition that "[t]he vindication of rights guaranteed by the
            Constitution has never been made to turn on the unreviewable discretion of an executive
            official or administrative tribunal." Post, at 440. But that case is in apposite insofar
            as it pertains to our discussion of clemency here. The Ford plurality held that
            Florida's procedures for entertaining post-trial claims of insanity, which vested the
            sanity determination entirely within the executive branch, were "inadequate to preclude
            federal redetermination of the constitutional issue [of Ford's sanity]." 477 U. S., at
            416. Unlike Ford's claim of insanity, which had never been presented in a judicial
            proceeding, petitioner's claim of "actual innocence" comes 10 years after he was
            adjudged guilty beyond a reasonable doubt after a full and fair trial. As the following
            discussion indicates, it is clear that clemency has provided the historic mechanism for
            obtaining relief in such circumstances.</p>

         <p>[15] The dissent points to one study concluding that 23 innocent persons have been
            executed in the United States this century as support for the proposition that clemency
            requests by persons believed to be innocent are not always granted. See post, at
            430-431, n. 1 (citing Bedau &amp;amp; Radelet, Miscarriages of Justice in Potentially
            Capital Cases, 40 Stan. L. Rev. 21 (1987)). Although we do not doubt that clemency
            &#x97; like the criminal justice system itself &#x97; is fallible, we note that scholars
            have taken issue with this study. See Markman &amp;amp; Cassell, Protecting the
            Innocent: A Response to the Bedau-Radelet Study, 41 Stan. L. Rev. 121 (1988).</p>
         <p>[*] My reference is to an article by Professor Monaghan, which discusses the unhappy
            truth that not every problem was meant to be solved by the United States Constitution,
            nor can be. See Monaghan, Our Perfect Constitution, 56 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 353 (1981).</p>
         <p>[1] One impressive study has concluded that 23 innocent people have been executed in the
            United States in this century, including one as recently as 1984. Bedau &amp;amp;
            Radelet, Miscarriages of Justice in Potentially Capital Cases, 40 Stan. L. Rev. 21, 36,
            173-179 (1987); M. Radelet, H. Bedau, &amp;amp; C. Putnam, In Spite of Innocence 282-356
            (1992). The majority cites this study to show that clemency has been exercised
            frequently in capital cases when showings of actual innocence have been made. See ante,
            at 415. But the study also shows that requests for clemency by persons the authors
            believe were innocent have been refused. See, e. g., Bedau &amp;amp; Radelet, 40 Stan.
            L. Rev., at 91 (discussing James Adams who was executed in Florida on May 10, 1984);
            Radelet, Bedau, &amp;amp; Putnam, In Spite of Innocence, at 5-10 (same).</p>
         <p>[2] It also may violate the Eighth Amendment to imprison someone who is actually
            innocent. See Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660, 667 (1962) ("Even one day in prison
            would be a cruel and unusual punishment for the `crime' of having a common cold"). On
            the other hand, this Court has noted that "`death is a different kind of punishment from
            any other which may be imposed in this country. . . . From the point of view of the
            defendant, it is different in both its severity and its finality.' " Beck v. Alabama,
            447 U. S. 625, 637 (1980), quoting Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 357 (1977)
            (opinion of Stevens, J.). We are not asked to decide in this case whether petitioner's
            continued imprisonment would violate the Constitution if he actually is innocent, see
            Brief for Petitioner 39, n. 52; Tr. of Oral Arg. 3-5, and I do not address that
            question.</p>
         <p>[3] The majority attempts to distinguish Johnson on the ground that Mississippi
            previously had considered claims like Johnson's by writ of error coram nobis. Ante, at
            406-407. We considered Mississippi's past practice in entertaining such claims, however,
            to determine not whether an Eighth Amendment violation had occurred but whether there
            was an independent and adequate state ground preventing us from reaching the merits of
            Johnson's claim. See 486 U. S., at 587-589. Respondent does not argue that there is any
            independent and adequate state ground that would prevent us from reaching the merits in
            this case.</p>
         <p>[4] The Court also suggests that Ford is distinguishable because "unlike the question of
            guilt or innocence . . . the issue of sanity is properly considered in proximity to the
            execution." Ante, at 406. Like insanity, however, newly discovered evidence of innocence
            may not appear until long after the conviction and sentence. In Johnson, the New York
            Court of Appeals decision that required reconsideration of Johnson's sentence came five
            years after he had been sentenced to death. 486 U. S., at 580-582.</p>
         <p>[5] The majority's explanation for its failure to address petitioner's substantive due
            process argument is fatuous. The majority would deny petitioner the opportunity to bring
            a substantive due process claim of actual innocence because a jury has previously found
            that he is not actually innocent. See ante, at 407, n. 6. To borrow a phrase, this "puts
            the cart before the horse." Ibid. </p>
         <p>Even under the procedural due process framework of Medina v. California, 505 U. S. 437
            (1992), the majority's analysis is incomplete, for it fails to consider "whether the
            rule transgresses any recognized principle of `fundamental fairness' in operation." Id.,
            at 448, quoting Dowling v. United States, 493 U. S. 342, 352 (1990).</p>
         <p>[6] Last Term in Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333 (1992), this Court adopted a different
            standard for determining whether a federal habeas petitioner bringing a successive,
            abusive, or defaulted claim has shown "actual innocence" of the death penalty. Under
            Sawyer, the petitioner must "show by clear and convincing evidence that, but for a
            constitutional error, no reasonable juror would have found the petitioner eligible for
            the death penalty under applicable state law." Id., at 336. That standard would be
            inappropriate here. First, it requires a showing of constitutional error in the trial
            process, which, for reasons already explained, is inappropriate when petitioner makes a
            substantive claim of actual innocence. Second, it draws its "no reasonable juror"
            standard from the standard for sufficiency of the evidence set forth in Jackson v.
            Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979). As I explain below, however, sufficiency of the evidence
            review differs in important ways from the question of actual innocence. Third, the Court
            developed this standard for prisoners who are concededly guilty of capital crimes. Here,
            petitioner claims that he is actually innocent of the capital crime.</p>
         <p>[7] Justice O'Connor reads too much into the fact that the District Court failed to pass
            on the sufficiency of the affidavits, did not suggest that it wished to hold an
            evidentiary hearing, and did not retain jurisdiction after the state-court action was
            filed. Ante, at 424. The explanation for each of these actions, as Justice O'Connor
            notes, is that the District Court believed that it could offer no relief in any event.
