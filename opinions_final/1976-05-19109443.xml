         <p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
         <p>The question presented in this case is whether a municipal ordinance requiring advance
            notice to be given to the local police department by "[a]ny person desiring to canvass,
            solicit or call from house to house . . . for a recognized charitable cause . . . or . .
            . political campaign or cause . . . in writing, for identification only" violates the
            guarantees of freedom of speech and due process of law embodied in the Fourteenth
            Amendment.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>(1)</h2>
         <p>The Borough of Oradell, N. J., has enacted two ordinances that together regulate most
            forms of door-to-door canvassing and solicitation. A broad ordinance, No. 573, requires
            all solicitors to obtain a permit from the borough clerk, by making a formal
            application, accompanied by a description and photograph of the applicant, the
            description and license number of any automobile to be used in soliciting, a driver's
            license, and other data. The ordinance apparently requires that the chief of police
            approve issuance of the permit.<span class="sup">[1]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*612</span> The ordinance at issue here, Ordinance No.
            598A, is an amendment to this broader scheme, and imposes no permit requirement; it
            covers persons soliciting for "a recognized charitable cause, or any person desiring to
               <span class="star-pagination">*613</span> canvass, solicit or call from house to
            house for a Federal, State, County or Municipal political campaign or cause." Ordinance
            No. 598A also applies to "representatives of Borough Civic Groups and Organizations and
            any veterans honorably discharged or released under honorable circumstances" from the
            Armed Forces. Those covered by this ordinance are required only to "notify the Police
            Department, in writing, for identification only." Once given, the notice is "good for
            the duration of the campaign or cause."<span class="sup">[2]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*614</span> Appellants are Edward Hynes, a New Jersey
            state assemblyman whose district was redrawn in 1973 to include the Borough of Oradell,
            and three Oradell registered voters. They brought suit in the Superior Court of Bergen
            County, N. J., seeking a declaration that Ordinance No. 598A was unconstitutional and an
            injunction against its enforcement. Appellant Hynes alleged that he wished to campaign
            for re-election in Oradell. The other <span class="star-pagination">*615</span>
            appellants alleged either that they wished to canvass door to door in the borough for
            political causes or that they wished to speak with candidates who campaigned in Oradell.
            Each appellant claimed that the ordinance would unconstitutionally restrict such
            activity.</p>
         <p>The Superior Court held the ordinance invalid for three reasons. First, the court noted
            that it contained no penalty clause, and hence was unenforceable under New Jersey law;
            second, the court held that the ordinance was not related to its announced
            purpose&#x97;the prevention of crime&#x97;since it required only candidates and
            canvassers to register.<span class="sup">[3]</span> Finally, the court concluded that
            the ordinance was vague and overbroad&#x97;unclear "as to what is, and what isn't
            required" of those who wished to canvass for political causes. The Appellate Division of
            the Superior Court affirmed, reaching and accepting only the first ground for the trial
            court's decision.</p>
         <p>The Supreme Court of New Jersey reversed. 66 N. J. 376, 331 A. 2d 277 (1975). It noted
            that a penalty clause, enacted during the pendency of the appeal, cured the defect that
            had concerned the Appellate Division. Relying largely on a decision in a case dealing
            with a similar ordinance, Collingswood v. Ringgold, 66 N. J. 350, 331 A. 2d 262 (1975),
            appeal docketed, No. 74-1335, the court held that Ordinance No. 598A was a legitimate
            exercise of the borough's police power, enacted to prevent crime and to reduce
            residents' fears about strangers wandering door to door. The ordinance regulated
            conduct&#x97; door-to-door canvassing&#x97;as well as speech, and in doing so "it could
            hardly be more clear." 66 N. J., at 380, 331 A. 2d, at 279. The ordinance, the court
            thought, imposed <span class="star-pagination">*616</span> minimal requirements which
            did not offend free speech interests:</p> "It may be satisfied in writing, suggesting
         that resort may be had to the mails. It need be fulfilled only once for each campaign.
         There is no fee. The applicant does not have to obtain or carry a card or license. And
         perhaps most importantly, no discretion reposes in any municipal official to deny the
         privilege of calling door to door. The ordinance is plainly an identification device in its
         most basic form." Ibid. <p>Two of the court's seven members dissented. One justice thought
            the ordinance "plain silly" as a crime-prevention measure, for the reasons given by the
            trial court. Id., at 382, 331 A. 2d, at 280; another justice thought that the "ordinance
            has the potential to have a significant chilling effect on the exercise of first
            amendment rights and thus infringes on these rights." Id., at 389, 331 A. 2d, at
            284.</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>(2)</h2>
         <p>We are not without guideposts in considering appellants' First Amendment challenge to
            Ordinance No. 598A. "Adjustment of the inevitable conflict between free speech and other
            interests is a problem as persistent as it is perplexing," Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U.
            S. 268, 275 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result), and this Court has in
            several cases reviewed attempts by municipalities to regulate activities like canvassing
            and soliciting. Regulation in this area "must be done, and the restriction applied, in
            such a manner as not to intrude upon the rights of free speech and free assembly,"
            Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S. 516, 540-541 (1945). But in these very cases the Court has
            consistently recognized a municipality's power to protect its citizens from crime and
            undue annoyance by regulating <span class="star-pagination">*617</span> soliciting and
            canvassing. A narrowly drawn ordinance, that does not vest in municipal officials the
            undefined power to determine what messages residents will hear, may serve these
            important interests without running afoul of the First Amendment.</p>
         <p>In Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444 (1938), the Court held invalid an ordinance that
            prohibited the distribution of "literature of any kind . . . without first obtaining
            written permission from the City Manager," id., at 447. The ordinance contained "no
            restriction in its application with respect to time or place," and was "not limited to
            ways which might be regarded as inconsistent with the maintenance of public order or as
            involving disorderly conduct, the molestation of the inhabitants, or the misuse or
            littering of the streets." Id., at 451.</p>
         <p>A year later, in Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147 (1939), the Court held
            unconstitutional an Irvington, N. J., ordinance that dealt specifically with
            house-to-house canvassers and solicitors. The ordinance required them to obtain a
            permit, which would not issue if the chief of police decided that "the canvasser is not
            of good character or is canvassing for a project not free from fraud." Id., at 158.
            Because the Court concluded that the canvasser's "liberty to communicate with the
            residents of the town at their homes depends upon the exercise of the officer's
            discretion," id., at 164, the Court held the ordinance invalid. In Cantwell v.
            Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296 (1940), the Court held that a similar permit ordinance, as
            applied to prevent Jehovah's Witnesses from soliciting door to door, infringed upon the
            right to free exercise of religion, guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
            And in Martin v. Struthers, 319 U. S. 141 (1943), the Court struck down a municipal
            ordinance that made it a crime for a solicitor or canvasser to knock on the front door
               <span class="star-pagination">*618</span> of a resident's home or ring the doorbell.
            See also Staub v. City of Baxley, 355 U. S. 313 (1958).</p>
         <p>In reaching these results, the Court acknowledged the valid and important interests
            these ordinances sought to serve. In Martin, supra, at 144, Mr. Justice Black writing
            for the Court stated:</p> "Ordinances of the sort now before us may be aimed at the
         protection of the householders from annoyance, including intrusion upon the hours of rest,
         and at the prevention of crime. Constant callers, whether selling pots or distributing
         leaflets, may lessen the peaceful enjoyment of a home as much as a neighborhood glue
         factory or railroad yard which zoning ordinances may prohibit. . . . In addition, burglars
         frequently pose as canvassers, either in order that they may have a pretense to discover
         whether a house is empty and hence ripe for burglary, or for the purpose of spying out the
         premises in order that they may return later. Crime prevention may thus be the purpose of
         regulatory ordinances." <p>As Mr. Justice Black suggested, the lone housewife has no way of
            knowing whether the purposes of the putative solicitor are benign or malignant, and even
            an innocuous caller "may lessen the peaceful enjoyment of a home." Ibid. In his view a
            municipality "can by identification devices" regulate canvassers in order to deter
            criminal conduct by persons "posing as canvassers," id., at 148, relying on the Court's
            statement in Cantwell, supra, at 306:</p> "Without doubt a State may protect its
         citizens from fraudulent solicitation by requiring a stranger in the community, before
         permitting him publicly to solicit funds for any purpose, to establish his <span
            class="star-pagination">*619</span> identity and his authority to act for the cause
         which he purports to represent." <p>These opinions of the Court and the dissenting opinions
            found common ground as to the important municipal interests at stake. See Martin v.
            Struthers, supra, at 152 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); id., at 154 (Reed, J.,
            dissenting); Douglas v. Jeannette, 319 U. S. 157, 166 (1943) (Jackson, J., dissenting in
            Martin v. Struthers). Professor Zechariah Chafee articulated something of the
            householder's right to be let alone, saying:</p> "Of all the methods of spreading
         unpopular ideas, [house-to-house canvassing] seems the least entitled to extensive
         protection. The possibilities of persuasion are slight compared with the certainties of
         annoyance. Great as is the value of exposing citizens to novel views, home is one place
         where a man ought to be able to shut himself up in his own ideas if he desires." Free
         Speech in the United States 406 (1954). <p>Professor Chafee went on to note: "[These cases]
            do not invalidate all ordinances that include within their scope . . . doorway
            dissemination of thought. Several sentences in the opinions state that ordinances
            suitably designed to take care of legitimate social interests are not void." Id., at
            407.</p>
         <p>There is, of course, no absolute right under the Federal Constitution to enter on the
            private premises of another and knock on a door for any purpose, and the police power
            permits reasonable regulation for public safety. We cannot say, and indeed appellants do
            not argue, that door-to-door canvassing and solicitation are immune from regulation
            under the State's police power, whether the purpose of the regulation is to protect from
            danger or to protect the peaceful enjoyment of the home. See <span
               class="star-pagination">*620</span> Rowan v. Post Office Dept., 397 U. S. 728,
            735-738 (1970).</p>
         <p/>
         <h2>(3)</h2>
         <p>There remains the question whether the challenged ordinance meets the test that in the
            First Amendment area "government may regulate . . . only with narrow specificity." NAACP
            v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 433 (1963). As a matter of due process, "[n]o one may be
            required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal
            statutes. All are entitled to be informed as to what the State commands or forbids."
            Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939). The general test of vagueness applies
            with particular force in review of laws dealing with speech. "[S]tricter standards of
            permissible statutory vagueness may be applied to a statute having a potentially
            inhibiting effect on speech; a man may the less be required to act at his peril here,
            because the free dissemination of ideas may be the loser." Smith v. California, 361 U.
            S. 147, 151 (1959). See also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 76-82 (1976); Broadrick v.
            Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 611-612 (1973).</p>
         <p>Notwithstanding the undoubted power of a municipality to enforce reasonable regulations
            to meet the needs recognized by the Court in the cases discussed, we conclude that
            Ordinance No. 598A must fall because in certain respects "men of common intelligence
            must necessarily guess at its meaning." Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U. S. 385,
            391 (1926). Since we conclude that the ordinance is invalid because of vagueness, we
            need not reach the other arguments appellants advance.<span class="sup">[4]</span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*621</span> First, the coverage of the ordinance is
            unclear; it does not explain, for example, whether a "recognized charitable cause" means
            one recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as tax exempt, one recognized by some
            community agency, or one approved by some municipal official. While it is fairly clear
            what the phrase "political campaign" comprehends, it is not clear what is meant by a
            "Federal, State, County or Municipal . . . cause." Finally, it is not clear what groups
            fall into the class of "Borough Civic Groups and Organizations" that the ordinance also
               covers.<span class="sup">[5]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Second, the ordinance does not sufficiently specify what those within its reach must do
            in order to comply. The citizen is informed that before soliciting he must "notify the
            Police Department, in writing, for identification only." But he is not told what must be
            set forth in the notice, or what the police will consider sufficient as
            "identification." This is in marked contrast to Ordinance No. 573 which sets out
            specifically what is required of commercial solicitors; it is not clear that the
            provisions of Ordinance 573 extend to Ordinance 598A. See n. 1, supra. Ordinance No.
            598A does not have comparable precision. The New Jersey Supreme Court construed the
            ordinance to permit one to send the required identification by mail; a canvasser who
            used the mail might well find&#x97;too late&#x97;that the identification <span
               class="star-pagination">*622</span> he provided by mail was inadequate. In this
            respect, as well as with respect to the coverage of the ordinance, this law "may trap
            the innocent by not providing fair warning." Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104,
            108 (1972). Nor does the ordinance "provide explicit standards for those who apply" it.
            Ibid. To the extent that these ambiguities and the failure to explain what
            "identification" is required give police the effective power to grant or deny permission
            to canvass for political causes, the ordinance suffers in its practical effect from the
            vice condemned in Lovell, Schneider, Cantwell, and Staub. See also Papachristou v. City
            of Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156, 162 (1972); Coates v. City of Cincinnati, 402 U. S. 611,
            614 (1971); Note, The Voidfor-Vagueness Doctrine in the Supreme Court, 109 U. Pa. L.
            Rev. 67, 75-85 (1960).</p>
         <p>The New Jersey Supreme Court undertook to give the ordinance a limiting construction by
            suggesting that since the identification requirement "may be satisfied in writing,. . .
            resort may be had to the mails," 66 N. J., at 380, 331 A. 2d, at 279, but this
            construction of the ordinance does not explain either what the law covers or what it
            requires; for example, it provides no clue as to what is a "recognized charity"; nor is
            political "cause" defined. Cf. Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104, 110-111 (1972);
            Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568 (1942); Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569
            (1941). Even assuming that a more explicit limiting interpretation of the ordinance
            could remedy the flaws we have pointed out&#x97; a matter on which we intimate no
            view&#x97;we are without power to remedy the defects by giving the ordinance
            constitutionally precise content.<span class="sup">[6]</span>Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S.

         <p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL joins, concurring in part.</p>
         <p>I join Part 3 of the Court's opinion holding that Oradell Ordinance No. 598A must be
            invalidated as impermissibly vague. The Court reserves decision on other constitutional
            contentions alleged to invalidate the ordinance. Ante, at 620-621, n. 4. Despite this
            reservation, Part 2 of the Court's opinion may be read as suggesting that, vagueness
            defects aside, an ordinance of this kind would ordinarily withstand constitutional
            attack. Because I believe that such ordinances must encounter substantial First
            Amendment barriers besides vagueness, I cannot join Part 2 and briefly state my
            reasons.</p>
         <p>In considering the validity of laws regulating door-to-door solicitation and canvassing,
            Mr. Justice Black, speaking for the Court in Martin v. Struthers, 319 U. S. <span
               class="star-pagination">*624</span> 141 (1943), properly recognized that
            municipalities have an important interest in keeping neighborhoods safe and peaceful.
            But unlike the Court today, he did not stop there. Rather, he emphasized the other side
            of the equation&#x97;that door-to-door solicitation and canvassing is a method of
            communication essential to the preservation of our free society. He said:</p> "While
         door to door distributers of literature may be either a nuisance or a blind for criminal
         activities, they may also be useful members of society engaged in the dissemination of
         ideas in accordance with the best tradition of free discussion. The widespread use of this
         method of communication by many groups espousing various causes attests its major
         importance. `Pamphlets have proved most effective instruments in the dissemination of
         opinion. And perhaps the most effective way of bringing them to the notice of individuals
         is their distribution at the homes of the people.' Schneider v. State, [308 U. S. 147, 164
         (1939)]. Many of our most widely established religious organizations have used this method
         of disseminating their doctrines, and laboring groups have used it in recruiting their
         members. The federal government, in its current war bond selling campaign, encourages
         groups of citizens to distribute advertisements and circulars from house to house. Of
         course, as every person acquainted with political life knows, door to door campaigning is
         one of the most accepted techniques of seeking popular support, while the circulation of
         nominating papers would be greatly handicapped if they could not be taken to the citizens
         in their homes. Door to door distribution of circulars is essential to the poorly financed
         causes of little people." Id., at 145-146. <p>It can hardly be denied that an ordinance
            requiring <span class="star-pagination">*625</span> the door-to-door campaigner to
            identify himself discourages free speech. Talley v. California, 362 U. S. 60 (1960),
            invalidated a Los Angeles ordinance requiring handbills to carry the name and address of
            persons writing, printing, or distributing them. Since the requirement destroyed
            anonymity, "[t]here [could] be no doubt that such an identification requirement would
            tend to restrict freedom to distribute information and thereby freedom of expression,"
            id., at 64, for:</p><p> "Anonymous pamphlets, leaflets, brochures and even books have
         played an important role in the progress of mankind. Persecuted groups and sects from time
         to time throughout history have been able to criticize oppressive practices and laws either
         anonymously or not at all. . . . Even the <ref type="treatise" num="none">Federalist</ref> Papers, written in favor of the
         adoption of our Constitution, were published under fictitious names. It is plain that
         anonymity has sometimes been assumed for the most constructive purposes." Id., at 64-65.
            </p><p>No less may be said of anonymity sought to be preserved in the door-to-door
            exposition of ideas. That anonymity is destroyed by an identification requirement like
            the Oradell ordinance.<span class="sup">[1]</span> "[I]dentification and fear of
            reprisal might deter perfectly peaceful discussions of public matters of importance,"
            id., at 65, particularly where door-to-door solicitation seeks discussion of sensitive
            and controversial issues, such as civilian police <span class="star-pagination"
               >*626</span> review boards, the decriminalization of specified types of conduct, or
            the recall of an elected police official. Deplorably, apprehension of reprisal by the
            average citizen is too often well founded. The national scene in recent times has
            regrettably provided many instances of penalties for controversial expression in the
            form of vindictive harassment, discriminatory law enforcement, executive abuse of
            administrative powers, and intensive government surveillance.<span class="sup"
               >[2]</span>
         </p>
         <p>Nor is the threat to free expression by ordinances of this type limited to their
            jeopardization of anonymity. Perhaps an even greater threat lies in the impermissible
            burden they impose upon political expression, the core conduct protected by the First
               Amendment.<span class="sup">[3]</span> Unquestionably, <span class="star-pagination"
               >*627</span> the lifeblood of today's political campaigning must be the work of
            volunteers. The oppressive financial burden of campaigns makes reliance on volunteers
               <span class="star-pagination">*628</span> absolutely essential and, in light of the
            enormous significance of citizen participation to the preservation and strength of the
            democratic ideal, absolutely desirable, indeed indispensable. Offensive to the
            sensibilities of private citizens, identification requirements such as the Oradell
            ordinance, even in their least intrusive form, must discourage that participation.</p>
         <p>I recognize that there are governmental interests that may justify restraints on free
            speech. But in the area of First Amendment protections, "[t]he rational connection
            between the remedy provided and the evil to be curbed, which in other contexts might
            support legislation against attack on due process grounds, will not suffice. . . .
            Accordingly, whatever occasion would restrain orderly discussion and persuasion, at
            appropriate time and place, must have clear support in public danger, actual or
            impending." Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S. 516, 530 (1945). Restraints implicit in
            identification requirements, however, extend beyond restrictions on time and
            place&#x97;they chill discussion itself. The Oradell type of ordinance therefore raises
            substantial First Amendment questions not presented by the usual time, place, and manner
               regulation.<span class="sup">[4]</span> See Grayned v. City of Rockford, <span
               class="star-pagination">*629</span> 408 U. S. 104, 115 (1972). Under the ordinance,
            no authentication of identity need be submitted, and therefore the requirement can be
            easily evaded.<span class="sup">[5]</span> In that circumstance, the requirement can
            hardly be justified as protective of overriding governmental interests since evasion can
            easily thwart that objective. See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 45 (1976). But
            imposition of more burdensome identification requirements, such as authentication, would
            doubtless only serve further to discourage protected activity and, therefore, not
            eliminate the First Amendment difficulty. Moreover, the purported aid to crime
            prevention provided by identification of solicitors is not so self-evident as to relieve
            the State of the burden of proving that this asserted interest would be served. What Mr.
            Justice Harlan said of the handbill ordinance invalidated in Talley may equally be said
            of ordinances of the Oradell type:</p> "Here the State says that this ordinance is aimed
         at the prevention of `fraud, deceit, false advertising, negligent use of words, obscenity,
         and libel,' in that <span class="star-pagination">*630</span> it will aid in the detection
         of those responsible for spreading material of that character. But the ordinance is not so
         limited, and I think it will not do for the State simply to say that the circulation of all
         anonymous handbills must be suppressed in order to identify the distributors of those that
         may be of an obnoxious character. In the absence of a more substantial showing as to Los
         Angeles' actual experience with the distribution of obnoxious handbills, such a generality
         is for me too remote to furnish a constitutionally acceptable justification for the
         deterrent effect on free speech which this all-embracing ordinance is likely to have." 362
         U. S., at 66-67 (concurring opinion).<span class="sup">[6]</span>
         <p>Contrary to the thrust of Part 2 of the Court's opinion, it seems inescapable that
            ordinances of the Oradell type, however precisely drafted to avoid the pitfalls of
            vagueness, must present substantial First Amendment questions. The imperiling of
            precious constitutional values, for reasons however justifiable, cannot be taken
            lightly. The prevention of crime is, of course, one of the most serious of modern-day
            problems. But our perception as individuals of the need to solve that particular problem
            should not color our judgment as to the constitutionality of measures aimed at that
            end.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="dissent" judge="rehnquist"><p>MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting.</p>
         <p>I agree with virtually everything said in Parts 1 and 2 of the Court's opinion, which
            indicates that the Oradell <span class="star-pagination">*631</span> ordinance in
            question can survive a wide range of "as applied" challenges based on the First and
            Fourteenth Amendments. I do not agree with Part 3 of the Court's opinion, which
            concludes that the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague as presently drafted.</p>
         <p>The Court recognizes that none of our cases have ever suggested that a regulation
            requiring only identification of canvassers or solicitors would violate any
            constitutional limitation. As noted by the Court in Part 2 of its opinion, at least two
            decisions have taken care to point out that such ordinances would unquestionably be
            valid. See Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 306 (1940); Martin v. Struthers, 319
            U. S. 141, 148 (1943).</p>
         <p>I also agree with the Court's observation that:</p> "A narrowly drawn ordinance, that
         does not vest in municipal officials the undefined power to determine what messages
         residents will hear, may serve these important interests without running afoul of the First
         Amendment." Ante, at 617. <p>The Court goes on to point out that this element of unbridled
            official discretion was present in all those cases in which the Court has invalidated
            laws which might otherwise be thought to bear a superficial resemblance to the ordinance
            at issue here. There is clearly no such vice in the Oradell ordinance. As the Court
            recognizes, Ordinance No. 598A "imposes no permit requirement." Ante, at 612. Instead,
            it comes to us with the binding, NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 432 (1963),
            construction of the New Jersey Supreme Court that under Oradell's law "no discretion
            reposes in any municipal official to deny the privilege of calling door to door." Ante,
            at 616, quoting from 66 N. J. 376, 380, 331 A. 2d 277, 279 (1975).</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*632</span> After demonstrating the undoubted
            constitutional validity of Oradell's ordinance in all other respects, the Court proceeds
            in Part 3 of its opinion to determine that the ordinance is unconstitutional because of
            its asserted vagueness. But even allowing for the stricter standard which the Court says
            is appropriate in dealing with laws regulating speech, ante, at 620, I fail to see any
            vagueness in this ordinance which would not inhere in any ordinance or statute which has
            never been applied.</p>
         <p>The first alleged infirmity cited by the Court is that the ordinance's coverage is
            unclear. It suggests that this occurs because it is difficult to ascertain precisely
            what "causes" are covered by the law or what groups come within a general definition
            found therein. Assuming for the moment that these references in the ordinance may be
            "vague," at least as that term is colloquially employed, there is no one in this case
            who may raise any claim that this "vagueness" is of constitutional dimension. From their
            verified complaint filed in Bergen County Superior Court, it is clear that appellants
            asserted interests only in the ordinance's effect upon political canvassing, either as
            it would deter their own ability to seek political support or in their desire to receive
            such entreaties in their homes. App. F. None of the appellants assert any connection
            with "charitable" or any other "causes," nor do they profess membership in any groups
            which might come within the class of "Borough Civic Groups and Organizations" which the
            Court believes to be somehow unclearly defined. And since the Court accepts that the
            only conduct which appellants present&#x97;political canvassing &#x97;may validly be
            regulated by means of an identification requirement more "narrowly drawn" than that at
            issue here, there would seem to be no justification, even on the Court's theory of this
            case, to permit appellants to raise claims which others might have against the <span
               class="star-pagination">*633</span> ordinance. Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601
            (1973).</p>
         <p>The Court seems initially to suggest in a footnote, ante, at 621 n. 5, that reliance
            upon a "vagueness" theory may somehow displace the normal prohibition against assertion
            of constitutional jus tertii. Any logic in such a purported distinction escapes me.
            Broadrick recognized that it is only the application of the doctrine of "overbreadth"
            which sometimes permits limited exceptions to traditional rules of standing in the First
            Amendment area. 413 U. S., at 610-616. Here no tenable overbreadth claim exists, and the
            Court correctly eschews reliance upon that doctrine. Thus the only claims properly
            before us are those based upon rights personal to the appellants.<span class="sup"
               >[*]</span> I do not understand the Court to dispute this proposition: instead of
            attempting to rely upon whatever distinctions which invocation of "vagueness" may
            afford, the Court in its footnote goes on to discover allegations of several appellants
            regarding asserted personal "rights" to receive information of political causes which it
            concludes are sufficient to confer standing. I read the appellants' complaint
            differently than does the Court. But more fundamentally, I fail to see how assertion of
            a purported "right to receive information" may permit one to raise a challenge grounded
            upon hypothetical <span class="star-pagination">*634</span> canvassers' potential
            uncertainty regarding coverage of an ordinance. And even if the Court were correct in
            determining that the scope of "political cause" is properly drawn into question, its
            expressions of uncertainty as to what constitutes a "recognized charitable cause" or a
            "Borough Civic Group [or] Organization" continue to float wholly detached from any
            plaintiff with standing to challenge those aspects of the ordinance's coverage.</p>
         <p>Assuming, on the other hand, that such issues as to the clarity of the coverage of
            Ordinance No. 598A are properly before the Court, I can see no constitutional infirmity
            in its language. In Broadrick we held that claims of vagueness directed against
            indistinguishable phrasing found in Oklahoma's Merit System of Personnel Administration
            Act were "all but frivolous." 413 U. S., at 607. In so doing we recognized:</p> "Words
         inevitably contain germs of uncertainty and . . . there may be disputes over the meaning of
         such terms . . . . But . . . `there are limitations in the English language with respect to
         being both specific and manageably brief, and it seems to us that although the
         [definitions] may not satisfy those intent on finding fault at any cost, they are set out
         in terms that the ordinary person exercising ordinary common sense can sufficiently
         understand and comply with, without sacrifice to the public interest.' " Id., at 608,
         quoting from CSC v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 578-579 (1973). <p>Broadrick's
            recognition of the inherent limitations upon anticipating and defining away every
            problem of interpretation which might arise regarding a new statute is undeniably sound,
            and it is largely dispositive of any claim that the ordinance's coverage is so unclear
            as to violate constitutional limitations.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="star-pagination">*635</span> The other shortcoming which the Court
            criticizes is the ordinance's failure to "sufficiently specify what those within its
            reach must do in order to comply." Ante, at 621. But, as the Court recognizes, the
            ordinance demands quite plainly that a person such as appellant Hynes who desires to
            canvass in the borough must "notify the Police Department, in writing, for
            identification only." As the chief of police of the borough of Oradell put it in an
            affidavit submitted to the Superior Court: "All that is asked is that [a political
            candidate] let us know who he is." App. G-5. I cannot see how this provision can
            possibly become the trap for the unwary the Court suggests in its opinion.</p>
         <p>Appellant Hynes, for example, knows he is involved in a political campaign and that he
            must identify himself, in writing, to the Oradell Police Department if he desires to
            canvass door to door there. Should he have any doubts as to whether his identification
            is sufficiently detailed, he has simple recourse close at hand; he need only ask the
            Oradell police: "Is that enough? Do you require anything more?" Persons may thus learn
            exactly what is required in practice. The Court hypothesizes that a canvasser who chose
            to submit the requisite identification to the Oradell police by mail might learn "too
            late" that his submission was inadequate. Such good-faith attempts at compliance might
            be found to preclude liability, and the availability of similar narrowing constructions
            says a good deal about the wisdom of declaring this law unconstitutional before it has
            ever been applied. But even apart from these considerations the most that the ordinance
            imposes upon potential casvassers is the necessity of identifying themselves
            sufficiently in advance to ensure they have satisfied the law before embarking door to
            door in Oradell. Such a delay, which can hardly be more than a few days, is surely not
               <span class="star-pagination">*636</span> an unconstitutional burden upon appellants'
            rights. Surely "the guarantees of freedom of speech and due process of law embodied in
            the Fourteenth Amendment," ante, at 611, do not require that an ordinance validly
            requiring the identification of citizens must specify every way in which they may
            satisfactorily provide that information. No constitutional value is served by permitting
            persons who have avoided any possibility of attempting to ascertain how they may comply
            with a law to claim that their studied ignorance demonstrates that the law is
            impermissibly vague.</p>
         <p>Finally, I do not understand the Court's concluding observations regarding the vice of
            vagueness which it perceives in the ordinance's compliance directive. The Court suggests
            that unspecified ambiguities may "give police the effective power to grant or deny
            permission to canvass for political causes." Ante, at 622. But as the Court itself notes
            in Part 2 of its opinion, it has been authoritatively held as a matter of New Jersey law
            that this ordinance reposes "no discretion . . . in any municipal official to deny the
            privilege of calling door to door." Thus the authorities which the Court cites directly
            before the penultimate paragraph of its opinion afford no support for the result it
            reaches.</p>
         <p>The Court "intimate[s] no view" as to appellants' other contentions, ante, at 621 n. 4.
            Since I do not agree that there exists any unconstitutional vagueness in Ordinance No.
            598A, I have felt obliged to consider these contentions to determine if today's result
            can be defended upon some other ground. I do not believe that it can be. I would
            therefore affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey.</p>

         <p>In Collingswood v. Ringgold, 66 N. J. 350, 331 A. 2d 262 (1975), appeal docketed, No.
            74-1335, decided the same day as the case reviewed here, the New Jersey Supreme Court
            held that an ordinance quite similar to Ordinance No. 573 was invalid insofar as it
            vested in the chief of police too much discretion in deciding whether or not to grant a
            canvassing permit. The court in Collingswood accordingly struck that provision of the
            ordinance, but let the remainder stand.</p>
         <p>[2] Ordinance No. 598A provides in relevant part: </p>
         <p>"WHEREAS, The Borough of Oradell is primarily a one family residential town whose
            citizens are employed elsewhere, resulting in the wives of the wage earner being left
            alone during the day; and</p>
         <p>"WHEREAS, because of the geographical location of most of the homes it is impossible to
            police all areas at the same time, resulting in a number of break and entries and
            larceny in the home; and</p>
         <p>"WHEREAS, it is in the public interest and the public safety that persons not be
            permitted to call from house to house on the pretext of soliciting votes for a
            designated candidate or signatures for a nominating petition, or to solicit for a
            recognized charitable cause or borough activity, without such persons being first
            identified by the Police Department; and</p>
         <p>"WHEREAS, the Mayor and Borough Council of The Borough of Oradell feel that it is in the
            public interest and for the protection of The Borough of Oradell that such persons be
            required to notify the Police Department for the purpose of identification.</p>
         <p>"NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED by the Borough Council of The Borough of Oradell, in the
            County of Bergen and State of New Jersey, that an ordinance entitled `An ordinance to
            regulate and prohibit canvassing and soliciting in The Borough of Oradell and establish
            fees and provide penalties for the violation thereof' be amended and supplemented as
            follows:</p>
         <p>"(1) That Section 1 be amended and supplemented by the addition of Section 1 (a) to be
            entitled `Exceptions to Permit' as hereinafter set forth:</p>
         <p>"Section 1 (a): Exceptions to Permit</p>
         <p>"Any person desiring to canvass, solicit or call from house to house in the Borough for
            a recognized charitable cause, or any person desiring to canvass, solicit or call from
            house to house for a Federal, State, County or Municipal political campaign or cause,
            shall be required to notify the Police Department, in writing, for identification only.
            Said notification shall be good for the duration of the campaign or cause. The
            provisions of this section shall also apply to representatives of Borough Civic Groups
            and Organizations and any veterans honorably discharged or released under honorable
            circumstances from active service in any branch of the Armed Forces of the United
            States. All other Sections of Ordinance No. 573, with the exception of the penalty
            clause designated as Section 7 [sic], shall not be applicable to such persons or groups
            as designated herein.</p>
         <p>"(2) All ordinances or parts of ordinances inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby
            repealed."</p>
         <p>[3] The trial court's opinion in this regard appears to ignore the provisions of
            Ordinance No. 573, which covers other forms of door-to-door solicitation, and to which
            Ordinance No. 598A is an amendment.</p>
         <p>[4] Appellants also argue that the ordinance bears no rational relationship to its
            announced purpose of crime prevention, that it is overbroad because it covers Oradell
            residents casually soliciting the votes of neighbors, and that it violates the
            Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by infringing on the right
            to meet and discuss national candidates. We intimate no view as to these
            contentions.</p>
         <p>[5] The flaw we find in this ordinance is vagueness, not the overbreadth at issue in
            Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601 (1973), on which the dissent relies. Several
            appellants alleged that their right to receive information would be infringed because
            persons canvassing for political causes would be uncertain whether the ordinance covered
            them. In the circumstances of this case these allegations are enough to put in issue the
            precision or lack of precision with which the ordinance defines the categories of
            "causes" it covers.</p>
         <p>[6] The agency charged with enforcement, the police department, has not adopted any
            regulations that would give more precise meaning to the ordinance&#x97;if indeed it has
            the legal power to do so. Cf. Broadrick, 413 U. S., at 616-617; CSC v. Letter Carriers,
            413 U. S. 548, 575 (1973); Law Students Research Council v. Wadmond, 401 U. S. 154,
            162-163 (1971). The chief of police suggested in an affidavit that neither a photograph
            nor fingerprints are required, and that the canvasser must simply "let us know who he
            is." To the extent that this explanation adds any specificity to the ordinance, it does
            not purport to be binding on the enforcement authorities. Cf. ibid. Nor has the
            ordinance a history of "less formalized custom and usage" that might remedy the
            vagueness problems. Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733, 754 (1974).</p>
         <p>[1] Ordinance 598A does not expressly require solicitors to identify the political
            campaign or candidate for whose cause they solicit. It may be that such a requirement is
            implicit in the provision that "notification [to the police] shall be good for the
            duration of the campaign or cause." If so, there may be a First Amendment question
            whether that disclosure can be compelled. Indeed, that question would be presented even
            if a requirement of personal identification could withstand First Amendment
            challenge.</p>
         <p>[2] Our recent decision in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976), is wholly consistent
            with this view. Buckley clearly recognized that "compelled disclosure, in itself, can
            seriously infringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First
            Amendment." Id., at 64. See id., at 68, 71, 81-82. In Buckley, the Court did uphold the
            disclosure provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act despite their effect on
            anonymity, distinguishing Talley v. California, 362 U. S. 60 (1960), as involving a
            disclosure law not narrowly limited to situations where the information sought has a
            substantial connection with the governmental interest sought to be advanced. Here,
            however, there are substantial questions whether identification requirements like
            Oradell's are so adequately related to their purpose as to withstand First Amendment
            challenge. See infra, at 628-630. Moreover, door-to-door solicitation, unlike the
            contribution of money, is an activity of high visibility. Consequently, the danger of
            deterrence is much greater here than with respect to contributions. Indeed, Buckley, in
            expressing its concern for the special problems of minority parties, recognized the
            greater threat posed to free speech where smaller numbers result in the clearer
            association of individuals with a cause. See 424 U. S., at 68-72.</p>
         <p>[3] "Discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are
            integral to the operation of the system of government established by our Constitution.
            The First Amendment affords the broadest protection to such political expression in
            order `to assure [the] unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of
            political and social changes desired by the people.' Roth v. United States, 354 U. S.
            476, 484 (1957). Although First Amendment protections are not confined to `the
            exposition of ideas,' Winters v. New York, 333 U. S. 507, 510 (1948), `there is
            practically universal agreement that a major purpose of th[e] Amendment was to protect
            the free discussion of governmental affairs, . . . of course includ[ing] discussions of
            candidates . . . .' Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214, 218 (1966). This no more than
            reflects our `profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues
            should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,' New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S.
            254, 270 (1964). In a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the
            citizenry to make informed choices among candidates for office is essential, for the
            identities of those who are elected will inevitably shape the course that we follow as a
            nation. As the Court observed in Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U. S. 265, 272 (1971),
            `it can hardly be doubted that the constitutional guarantee has its fullest and most
            urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office.' "
            Buckley v. Valeo, supra, at 14-15. </p>
         <p>"The First Amendment does not protect a `freedom to speak.' It protects the freedom of
            those activities of thought and communication by which we `govern.'. . .</p>
         <p>"In the specific language of the Constitution, the governing activities of the people
            appear only in terms of casting a ballot. But in the deeper meaning of the Constitution,
            voting is merely the external expression of a wide and diverse number of activities by
            means of which citizens attempt to meet the responsibilities of making judgments, which
            that freedom to govern lays upon them. . . .</p>
         <p>"The responsibilities mentioned are of three kinds. We, the people who govern, must try
            to understand the issues which, incident by incident, face the nation. We must pass
            judgment upon the decisions which our agents make upon those issues. And, further, we
            must share in devising methods by which those decisions can be made wise and effective
            or, if need be, supplanted by others which promise greater wisdom and effectiveness. . .
            . These are the activities to whose freedom [the First Amendment] gives its unqualified
            protection." Meiklejohn, The First Amendment is an Absolute, 1961 Sup. Ct. Rev. 245,
            255.</p>
         <p>[4] To be sure, Mr. Justice Black did observe in Martin v. Struthers, 319 U. S. 141, 148
            (1943), that "[a] city can . . . by identification devices control the abuse of the
            privilege by criminals posing as canvassers." The validity of that passing remark,
            however, may be questioned in light of the later decisions in Talley v. California,
            supra, and Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S. 516 (1945). Moreover, the footnote accompanying
            that statement apparently limited its applicability to solicitation of money. The
            footnote states: " `Without doubt a State may protect its citizens from fraudulent
            solicitation by requiring a stranger in the community, before permitting him publicly to
            solicit funds for any purpose, to establish his identity and his authority to act for
            the cause which he purports to represent,' " 319 U. S., at 148 n. 14 (emphasis added)
            (quoting Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 306 (1940)). But, as I suggest in the
            text, solicitation of support for a candidate in a political campaign presents a First
            Amendment question of a very different order. The opinion in Thomas draws the
            distinction: </p>
         <p>"We think a requirement that one must register before he undertakes to make a public
            speech to enlist support for a lawful movement is quite incompatible with the
            requirements of the First Amendment.</p>
         <p>"Once the speaker goes further, however, and engages in conduct which amounts to more
            than the right of free discussion comprehends, as when he undertakes the collection of
            funds or securing subscriptions, he enters a realm where a reasonable registration or
            identification requirement may be imposed. . . ." 323 U. S., at 540.</p>
         <p>[5] Indeed, the opinion of the New Jersey Supreme Court suggests that mailing the
            information would satisfy the ordinance's identification requirements. See 66 N. J. 376,
            380, 331 A. 2d 277, 279 (1975).</p>
         <p>[6] See also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 64: "We long have recognized that
            significant encroachments on First Amendment rights of the sort that compelled
            disclosure imposes cannot be justified by a mere showing of some legitimate governmental
            interest. Since [NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U. S. 449 (1958)] we have required that the
            subordinating interests of the State must survive exacting scrutiny. We also have
            insisted that there be a `relevant correlation' or `substantial relation' between the
            governmental interest and the information required to be disclosed."</p>
         <p>[*] Had appellants attempted to bring their action in the Federal District Court for the
            District of New Jersey, Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971), and its companion cases
            would seem to pose insuperable barriers to its successful maintenance. But as the New
            Jersey courts chose to entertain appellants' constitutional challenge to the Oradell
            ordinance despite its having never been applied, the considerations of equity, comity,
            and federalism which underlie the holding in Younger are here largely absent. And since
            the judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court is reviewable on our obligatory docket, 28
            U. S. C. § 1257 (2), some of appellants' claims are properly before the Court.</p>
