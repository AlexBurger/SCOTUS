CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&#xD;
                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT&#xD;
&#xD;
    No. 09–529.      Argued December 1, 2010—Decided April 19, 2011&#xD;
Together, the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights&#xD;
  Act of 2000 (DD Act) and the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals&#xD;
  with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI Act) offer States federal money to&#xD;
  improve, inter alia, medical care for persons with developmental dis&#xD;
  abilities or mental illness. As a condition of funding, a State must es&#xD;
  tablish a protection and advocacy (P&amp;A) system “to protect and advo&#xD;
  cate [those individuals’] rights.”      42 U. S. C. §15043(a)(1).     A&#xD;
  participating State may appoint either a state agency or a private&#xD;
  nonprofit entity as its P&amp;A system, but if a state agency it must have&#xD;
  authority to litigate and freedom from the control of other state agen&#xD;
  cies or officers. Virginia has appointed an independent state agency,&#xD;
  petitioner Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy (VOPA), au&#xD;
  thorizing it to litigate to secure disabled individuals’ rights, free of&#xD;
  executive-branch oversight; to operate independently of Virginia’s at&#xD;
  torney general; and to employ its own lawyers to sue on its behalf.&#xD;
    While investigating patient deaths and injuries at state mental&#xD;
  hospitals, VOPA asked respondents—state officials in charge of those&#xD;
  hospitals—to produce relevant patient records. Respondents refused,&#xD;
  asserting that a state-law privilege shielded the records from disclo&#xD;
  sure. VOPA then filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking a dec&#xD;
  laration that respondents’ refusal to produce the records violated the&#xD;
  DD and PAIMI Acts and an injunction requiring respondents to pro&#xD;
  duce the records and refrain in the future from interfering with&#xD;
  VOPA’s right of access. Respondents moved to dismiss on the ground&#xD;

                          v. STEWART&#xD;
                             Syllabus&#xD;
&#xD;
    that they are immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment, but&#xD;
    the court held that the suit was permitted by the doctrine of Ex parte&#xD;
    Young, 209 U. S. 123, which normally allows federal courts to award&#xD;
    prospective relief against state officials for violations of federal law.&#xD;
    The Fourth Circuit reversed, finding that Ex parte Young did not ap&#xD;
    ply because the suit was brought by a state agency.&#xD;
Held: Ex parte Young allows a federal court to hear a lawsuit for pro&#xD;
 spective relief against state officials brought by another agency of the&#xD;
 same State. Pp. 4–13.&#xD;
    (a) Absent a waiver of sovereign immunity by a State itself or a&#xD;
 valid abrogation by Congress, federal courts may not entertain a pri&#xD;
 vate person’s suit against a State. Pp. 4–5.&#xD;
    (b) The doctrine of Ex parte Young, which establishes an important&#xD;
 limitation on the sovereign-immunity principle, is accepted as neces&#xD;
 sary to “permit the federal courts to vindicate federal rights.” Penn&#xD;
 hurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89. It rests&#xD;
 on the premise that when a federal court commands a state official to&#xD;
 do nothing more than refrain from violating federal law, he is not the&#xD;
 State for sovereign-immunity purposes. It does not apply “when ‘the&#xD;
 state is the . . . party in interest.’ ” Id., at 101. Pp. 5–6.&#xD;
    (c) Entertaining VOPA’s action is consistent with precedent and&#xD;
 does not offend the distinctive interests protected by sovereign im&#xD;
 munity. Pp. 6–13.&#xD;
       (1) Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U. S.&#xD;
 635, held that, in determining the Ex parte Young doctrine’s applica&#xD;
 bility, “a court need only conduct a ‘straightforward inquiry into&#xD;
 whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law&#xD;
 and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.’ ” Id., at 645.&#xD;
 VOPA’s suit satisfies that inquiry. Respondents concede that the ac&#xD;
 tion would be proper were VOPA a private organization rather than a&#xD;
 state agency. The “general criterion for determining when a suit is in&#xD;
 fact against the sovereign is the effect of the relief sought,” Penn&#xD;
 hurst, supra, at 107, not who is bringing the lawsuit. This Court ap&#xD;
 plied that criterion in Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S.&#xD;
 261, which held that an Indian Tribe could not invoke Ex parte Young&#xD;
 to bring what was essentially a quiet title suit that would “extinguish&#xD;
 [Idaho’s] control over . . . lands and waters long deemed . . . an inte&#xD;
 gral part of its territory.” Id., at 282. Respondents have advanced no&#xD;
 argument that the relief sought here threatens a similar invasion of&#xD;
 Virginia’s sovereignty. Pp. 7–9.&#xD;
       (2) Respondents claim that a State’s dignity is diminished when&#xD;
 a federal court adjudicates a dispute between its components. But a&#xD;
 State’s stature is not diminished to any greater degree when its own&#xD;
 agency sues to enforce its officers’ compliance with federal law than&#xD;
                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3&#xD;
&#xD;
                                Syllabus&#xD;
&#xD;
  when a private person does so. Moreover, VOPA’s power to sue state&#xD;
  officials is a consequence of Virginia’s own decision to establish a&#xD;
  public P&amp;A system. Not every offense to a State’s dignity constitutes&#xD;
  a denial of sovereign immunity. The specific indignity against which&#xD;
  sovereign immunity protects is the insult to a State of being haled&#xD;
  into court without its consent; that does not occur just because a suit&#xD;
  happens to be brought by another state agency. Pp. 9–11.&#xD;
       (3) The apparent novelty of this suit is not likely a consequence&#xD;
  of past constitutional doubts. In order to invoke the Ex parte Young&#xD;
  exception, a state agency needs both a federal right that it possesses&#xD;
  against its parent State and authority to sue state officials to enforce&#xD;
  that right, free from any internal state-government veto; such condi&#xD;
  tions rarely coincide. In any event, the principles undergirding the&#xD;
  Ex parte Young doctrine support its extension to actions of this kind.&#xD;

&#xD;
&#xD;
   JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.&#xD;
   We consider whether Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123&#xD;
(1908), allows a federal court to hear a lawsuit for prospec&#xD;
tive relief against state officials brought by another agency&#xD;
of the same State.&#xD;
                             I&#xD;

                            A&#xD;
&#xD;
  The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of&#xD;
Rights Act of 2000 (DD Act), 114 Stat. 1677, 42 U. S. C.&#xD;
§15001 et seq., offers States federal money to improve&#xD;
community services, such as medical care and job train&#xD;
ing, for individuals with developmental disabilities. See&#xD;
§§15023(a), 15024. As a condition of that funding, a State&#xD;
must establish a protection and advocacy (P&amp;A) system&#xD;
“to protect and advocate the rights of individuals with&#xD;
developmental disabilities.” §15043(a)(1). The P&amp;A sys&#xD;
tem receives separate federal funds, paid to it directly.&#xD;
§15042(a) and (b). A second federal law, the Protection&#xD;
2    VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY&#xD;
                       v. STEWART&#xD;
                    Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act&#xD;
(PAIMI Act), 100 Stat. 478, 42 U. S. C. §10801 et seq.,&#xD;
increases that separate funding and extends the mission&#xD;
of P&amp;A systems to include the mentally ill. §§10802(2),&#xD;
10803, 10827. At present, every State accepts funds under&#xD;
these statutes.&#xD;
   Under the DD and PAIMI Acts, a P&amp;A system must&#xD;
have certain powers. The system “shall . . . have the&#xD;
authority to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect . . .&#xD;
if the incidents are reported to the system or if there is&#xD;
probable cause to believe that the incidents occurred.”&#xD;
§15043(a)(2)(B); §10805(a)(1)(A). Subject to certain statu&#xD;
tory requirements, it must be given access to “all records”&#xD;
of individuals who may have been abused, see&#xD;
§15043(a)(2)(I)(iii)(II); §10805(a)(4)(B)(iii), as well as&#xD;
“other records that are relevant to conducting an investi&#xD;
gation,” §15043(a)(2)(J)(i). The Acts also require that a&#xD;
P&amp;A system have authority to “pursue legal, administra&#xD;
tive, and other appropriate remedies or approaches to&#xD;
ensure the protection of” its charges. §15043(a)(2)(A)(i);&#xD;
see §10805(a)(1)(B). And in addition to pressing its own&#xD;
rights, a P&amp;A system may “pursue administrative, legal,&#xD;
and other remedies on behalf of” those it protects.&#xD;
§10805(a)(1)(C); see §15044(b).&#xD;
   A participating State is free to appoint either a state&#xD;
agency or a private nonprofit entity as its P&amp;A system.&#xD;
§15044(a); §10805(c)(1)(B). But in either case, the desig&#xD;
nated entity must have certain structural features that&#xD;
ensure its independence from the State’s government. The&#xD;
DD Act prohibits the Governor from appointing more than&#xD;
one-third of the members of the system’s governing board,&#xD;
§15044(a)(2), and restricts the State’s ability to impose&#xD;
hiring freezes or other measures that would impair the&#xD;
system’s ability to carry out its mission, §15043(a)(2)(K).&#xD;
Once a State designates an entity as its P&amp;A system, it&#xD;
may not change its selection without “good cause.”&#xD;

&#xD;
                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
§15043(a)(4)(A).&#xD;
   Virginia is one of just eight States that have designated&#xD;
a government entity as their P&amp;A system. The Virginia&#xD;
Office for Protection and Advocacy (VOPA) is an “inde&#xD;
pendent state agency.” Va. Code Ann. §51.5–39.2(A)&#xD;
(Lexis 2009). Its board consists of eleven “nonlegislative&#xD;
citizen members,” of whom only three are appointed by&#xD;
the Governor. §51.5–39.2(B). The remaining eight are&#xD;
appointed by components of the legislature: five by the&#xD;
Speaker of the House of Delegates, and three by the Sen&#xD;
ate Committee on Rules. Ibid. VOPA itself nominates&#xD;
candidates for consideration, and the statute instructs the&#xD;
appointing officials that they “shall seriously consider the&#xD;
persons nominated and appoint such persons whenever&#xD;
feasible.” Ibid. Board members serve for fixed terms and&#xD;
are removable only by a court and only for specified rea&#xD;
sons. See §51.5–39.2(C) and (F); §24.2–233 and 234 (Lexis&#xD;
2006).&#xD;
   VOPA enjoys authority to litigate free of executive&#xD;
branch oversight. It operates independently of the Attor&#xD;
ney General of Virginia and employs its own lawyers, who&#xD;
are statutorily authorized to sue on VOPA’s behalf. §51.5–&#xD;
39.2(A); §2.2–510(5) (Lexis 2008). And Virginia law spe&#xD;
cifically empowers VOPA to “initiate any proceedings to&#xD;
secure the rights” of disabled individuals. §51.5–39.2(A).&#xD;
                             B&#xD;
   In 2006, VOPA opened an investigation into the deaths&#xD;
of two patients and injuries to a third at state-run mental&#xD;
hospitals. It asked respondents—state officials in charge&#xD;
of those institutions—to produce any records related to&#xD;
risk-management or mortality reviews conducted by the&#xD;
hospitals with respect to those patients. Respondents&#xD;
refused, asserting that the records were protected by a&#xD;
state-law privilege shielding medical peer-review materi&#xD;
als from disclosure.&#xD;

                          v. STEWART&#xD;
                       Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
  VOPA then brought this action in the United States&#xD;
District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging&#xD;
that the DD and PAIMI Acts entitled it to the peer-review&#xD;
records, notwithstanding any state-law privilege that&#xD;
might apply. It sought a declaration that respondents’&#xD;
refusal to produce the records violated the DD and PAIMI&#xD;
Acts, along with an injunction requiring respondents to&#xD;
provide access to the records and refrain in the future&#xD;
from interfering with VOPA’s right of access to them.&#xD;
Respondents moved to dismiss the action on the grounds&#xD;
that they are immune from suit under the Eleventh&#xD;
Amendment. The District Court denied the motion. In its&#xD;
view, the suit was permitted by the doctrine of Ex parte&#xD;
Young, which normally allows federal courts to award&#xD;
prospective relief against state officials for violations of&#xD;
federal law. Virginia v. Reinhard, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">2008</span> <span class="reporter">WL</span> <span class="page">2795940</span></span><pre class="inline">, *6&#xD;
(ED Va., July 18, 2008).&#xD;
  The Court of Appeals reversed. Virginia v. Reinhard,&#xD;
568 F. 3d 110 (CA4 2009). Believing VOPA’s lawsuit to be&#xD;
an “intramural contest” that “encroaches more severely on&#xD;
the dignity and sovereignty of the states than an Ex parte&#xD;
Young action brought by a private plaintiff,” the Court of&#xD;
Appeals concluded it was not authorized by that case. Id.,&#xD;
at 119–120 (internal quotation marks omitted).&#xD;
  We granted certiorari. 561 U. S. ____ (2010).&#xD;

——————&#xD;
    1 The&#xD;
        Eleventh Amendment reads as follows:&#xD;
  “The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to&#xD;
extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against&#xD;
one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or&#xD;
Subjects of any Foreign State.”&#xD;

                         Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
ment in the famous case of Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall.&#xD;
419 (1793), which involved a suit against a State by a&#xD;
noncitizen of the State. Since Hans v. Louisiana, 134&#xD;
U. S. 1 (1890), however, we have understood the Eleventh&#xD;
Amendment to confirm the structural understanding that&#xD;
States entered the Union with their sovereign immunity&#xD;
intact, unlimited by Article III’s jurisdictional grant.&#xD;
Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 779&#xD;
(1991); see Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Hal&#xD;
derman, 465 U. S. 89, 98 (1984). Our cases hold that the&#xD;
States have retained their traditional immunity from suit,&#xD;
“except as altered by the plan of the Convention or certain&#xD;
constitutional amendments.” Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S.&#xD;
706, 713 (1999). A State may waive its sovereign immu&#xD;
nity at its pleasure, College Savings Bank v. Florida Pre&#xD;
paid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 675–&#xD;
676 (1999), and in some circumstances Congress may&#xD;
abrogate it by appropriate legislation.2 But absent waiver&#xD;
or valid abrogation, federal courts may not entertain a&#xD;
private person’s suit against a State.&#xD;
                             B&#xD;
  In Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, we established an&#xD;
important limit on the sovereign-immunity principle.&#xD;
That case involved a challenge to a Minnesota law reduc&#xD;
ing the freight rates that railroads could charge. A rail&#xD;
road shareholder claimed that the new rates were un&#xD;
constitutionally confiscatory, and obtained a federal&#xD;
injunction against Edward Young, the Attorney General of&#xD;
Minnesota, forbidding him in his official capacity to en&#xD;
force the state law. Perkins v. Northern Pacific R. Co., </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">155</span>&#xD;

  2 We  have recognized that Congress may abrogate a State’s immunity&#xD;
when it acts under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Seminole Tribe of&#xD;
Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 59 (1996), but not when it acts under its&#xD;
original Article I authority to regulate commerce, id., at 65–66.&#xD;

                    Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
tion by initiating an enforcement action in state court, the&#xD;
Circuit Court held him in contempt and committed him to&#xD;
federal custody. In his habeas corpus application in this&#xD;
Court, Young challenged his confinement by arguing that&#xD;
Minnesota’s sovereign immunity deprived the federal&#xD;
court of jurisdiction to enjoin him from performing his&#xD;
official duties.&#xD;
   We disagreed. We explained that because an unconsti&#xD;
tutional legislative enactment is “void,” a state official who&#xD;
enforces that law “comes into conflict with the superior&#xD;
authority of [the] Constitution,” and therefore is “stripped&#xD;
of his official or representative character and is subjected&#xD;
in his person to the consequences of his individual con&#xD;
duct. The State has no power to impart to him any immu&#xD;
nity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the&#xD;
United States.” 209 U. S., at 159–160.&#xD;
   This doctrine has existed alongside our sovereign&#xD;
immunity jurisprudence for more than a century, accepted&#xD;
as necessary to “permit the federal courts to vindicate&#xD;
federal rights.” Pennhurst, 465 U. S., at 105. It rests on&#xD;
the premise—less delicately called a “fiction,” id., at 114,&#xD;
n. 25—that when a federal court commands a state official&#xD;
to do nothing more than refrain from violating federal law,&#xD;
he is not the State for sovereign-immunity purposes. The&#xD;
doctrine is limited to that precise situation, and does not&#xD;
apply “when ‘the state is the real, substantial party in&#xD;
interest,’ ” id., at 101 (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. Depart&#xD;
ment of Treasury of Ind., 323 U. S. 459, 464 (1945)), as&#xD;
when the “ ‘judgment sought would expend itself on the&#xD;
public treasury or domain, or interfere with public ad&#xD;
ministration,’ ” 465 U. S., at 101, n. 11 (quoting Dugan v.&#xD;
Rank, 372 U. S. 609, 620 (1963)).&#xD;
                             C&#xD;
  This case requires us to decide how to apply the Ex parte&#xD;
Young doctrine to a suit brought by an independent state&#xD;

   In Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535&#xD;
U. S. 635 (2002), we held that “[i]n determining whether&#xD;
the doctrine of Ex parte Young avoids an Eleventh Amend&#xD;
ment bar to suit, a court need only conduct a ‘straightfor&#xD;
ward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an&#xD;
ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly&#xD;
characterized as prospective.’ ” Id., at 645 (quoting Idaho&#xD;
v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 296 (1997)&#xD;
(O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg&#xD;
ment)). There is no doubt VOPA’s suit satisfies that&#xD;
straightforward inquiry. It alleges that respondents’&#xD;
refusal to produce the requested medical records violates&#xD;
federal law; and it seeks an injunction requiring the pro&#xD;
duction of the records, which would prospectively abate&#xD;
the alleged violation. Respondents concede that were&#xD;
VOPA a private organization rather than a state agency,&#xD;
the doctrine would permit this action to proceed.3&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  3 The dissent is mistaken when it claims that applying the Verizon&#xD;
Maryland test would mean two of our cases were “wrongly decided.”&#xD;
Post, at 4 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). We discuss the first of those&#xD;
cases, Coeur d’Alene Tribe, below. Infra, at 8. As for the second,&#xD;
Seminole Tribe, supra, it is inapposite. The reason we refused to&#xD;
permit suit to proceed in that case was that the Indian Gaming Regula&#xD;
tory Act created an alternative remedial scheme that would be under&#xD;
mined by permitting Ex parte Young suits; Congress, we said, had&#xD;
foreclosed recourse to the doctrine. See Seminole Tribe, supra, at 73–&#xD;
76.&#xD;
    Respondents now argue—for the first time in this litigation—that&#xD;
the DD and PAIMI Acts have the same effect here. We reject that&#xD;
suggestion. The fact that the Federal Government can exercise over&#xD;
sight of a federal spending program and even withhold or withdraw&#xD;

                       v. STEWART&#xD;
                    Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
   We see no reason for a different result here. Although&#xD;
respondents argue that VOPA’s status as a state agency&#xD;
changes the calculus, there is no warrant in our cases for&#xD;
making the validity of an Ex parte Young action turn on&#xD;
the identity of the plaintiff. To be sure, we have been&#xD;
willing to police abuses of the doctrine that threaten to&#xD;
evade sovereign immunity. To do otherwise “would be&#xD;
to adhere to an empty formalism.” Coeur d’Alene Tribe,&#xD;
supra, at 270. But (as the dissent concedes, post, at 8&#xD;
(opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.)) the limits we have recognized&#xD;
reflect the principle that the “general criterion for deter&#xD;
mining when a suit is in fact against the sovereign is the&#xD;
effect of the relief sought,” Pennhurst, supra, at 107, not&#xD;
who is bringing the lawsuit. Thus, Ex parte Young cannot&#xD;
be used to obtain an injunction requiring the payment of&#xD;
funds from the State’s treasury, see Edelman v. Jordan,&#xD;
415 U. S. 651, 666 (1974); or an order for specific perform&#xD;
ance of a State’s contract, see id., at 666–667; In re Ayers,&#xD;
123 U. S. 443 (1887).&#xD;
   Coeur d’Alene Tribe, on which respondents heavily rely,&#xD;
is an application of this principle. There we refused to&#xD;
allow an Indian Tribe to use Ex parte Young to obtain&#xD;
injunctive and declaratory relief establishing its exclusive&#xD;
right to the use and enjoyment of certain submerged lands&#xD;
in Idaho and the invalidity of all state statutes and regu&#xD;
lations governing that land. 521 U. S., at 265. We deter&#xD;
mined that the suit was “the functional equivalent of a&#xD;
quiet title suit against Idaho,” would “extinguish . . . the&#xD;
State’s control over a vast reach of lands and waters long&#xD;
deemed by the State to be an integral part of its territory,”&#xD;
and thus was barred by sovereign immunity. Id., at 282.&#xD;

                         Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
  Respondents have advanced no argument that the relief&#xD;
sought in this case threatens any similar invasion of Vir&#xD;
ginia’s sovereignty. Indeed, they concede that the very&#xD;
injunction VOPA requests could properly be awarded by a&#xD;
federal court at the instance of a private P&amp;A system.&#xD;
                               2&#xD;
   Respondents and the dissent argue that entertaining&#xD;
VOPA’s lawsuit in a federal forum would nevertheless&#xD;
infringe Virginia’s sovereign interests because it dimin&#xD;
ishes the dignity of a State for a federal court to adjudicate&#xD;
a dispute between its components. See Brief for Respon&#xD;
dents 23–26; post, at 4–8 (arguing that “ ‘special sover&#xD;
eignty interests’ ” bar VOPA’s lawsuit (quoting Coeur&#xD;
d’Alene Tribe, supra, at 281)). We disagree. As an initial&#xD;
matter, we do not understand how a State’s stature could&#xD;
be diminished to any greater degree when its own agency&#xD;
polices its officers’ compliance with their federal obliga&#xD;
tions, than when a private person hales those officers into&#xD;
federal court for that same purpose—something everyone&#xD;
agrees is proper.4 And in this case, of course, VOPA’s&#xD;
power to sue state officials is a consequence of Virginia’s&#xD;
own decision to establish a public, rather than a private,&#xD;
P&amp;A system. We fail to perceive what Eleventh Amend&#xD;
ment indignity is visited on the Commonwealth when, by&#xD;
operation of its own laws, VOPA is admitted to federal&#xD;
&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  4 The dissent compares VOPA’s lawsuit to such indignities as “canni&#xD;
&#xD;
balism” and “patricide,” since it is a greater “affront to someone’s&#xD;
dignity to be sued by a brother than to be sued by a stranger.” Post, at&#xD;
9. We think the dissent’s principle of familial affront less than univer&#xD;
sally applicable, even with respect to real families, never mind govern&#xD;
mental siblings. Most of us would probably prefer contesting a testa&#xD;
mentary disposition with a relative to contesting it with a stranger.&#xD;
And confining one’s child to his room is called grounding, while confin&#xD;
ing a stranger’s child is called kidnaping. Jurisdiction over this case&#xD;
does not depend on which is the most apt comparison.&#xD;

  But even if it were true that the State’s dignity were&#xD;
offended in some way by the maintenance of this action in&#xD;
federal court, that would not prove respondents’ case.&#xD;
Denial of sovereign immunity, to be sure, offends the&#xD;
dignity of a State; but not every offense to the dignity of a&#xD;
State constitutes a denial of sovereign immunity. The&#xD;
specific indignity against which sovereign immunity pro&#xD;
tects is the insult to a State of being haled into court&#xD;
without its consent. That effectively occurs, our cases&#xD;
reasonably conclude, when (for example) the object of the&#xD;
suit against a state officer is to reach funds in the state&#xD;
treasury or acquire state lands; it does not occur just&#xD;
because the suit happens to be brought by another state&#xD;
agency. Respondents’ asserted dignitary harm is simply&#xD;
unconnected to the sovereign-immunity interest.&#xD;
  The dissent complains that applying Ex parte Young to&#xD;
this lawsuit divides Virginia against itself, since the op&#xD;
posing parties are both creatures of the Commonwealth.&#xD;
Post, at 7. Even if that were a distinctive consequence of&#xD;
letting this suit proceed in federal court, it would have&#xD;
nothing to do with the concern of sovereign-immunity—&#xD;
whether the suit is against an unconsenting State, rather&#xD;
than against its officers. But it is not a consequence of the&#xD;
federal nature of the forum. The same result will follow if&#xD;
the federal claim is sued upon in state court, as the dis&#xD;
sent would require. There also, “[w]hatever the decision&#xD;

  5 The dissent accuses us of circular reasoning, because we “wrongly&#xD;
&#xD;
assum[e] [that] Virginia knew in advance the answer to the question&#xD;
presented in this case.” Post, at 10. That would be true if we were&#xD;
relying on the Commonwealth’s waiver of sovereign immunity. We are&#xD;
not. We rely upon Ex parte Young. We say that Virginia has only itself&#xD;
to blame for the position in which it finds itself, not because it con&#xD;
sented to suit, but because it created a state entity to sue, instead of&#xD;
leaving the task to a private entity. It did not have to know that this&#xD;
would allow suit in federal court. Know or not know, Ex parte Young&#xD;
produces that result.&#xD;

in the litigation, . . . [t]he Commonwealth will win[, a]nd&#xD;
the Commonwealth will lose.” Ibid. Nor would sending&#xD;
the matter to state court even avoid the prospect that “a&#xD;
federal judge will resolve which part of the Common&#xD;
wealth will prevail,” ibid., since the state-court loser could&#xD;
always ask this Court to review the matter by certiorari.&#xD;
(Or is that appeal also to be disallowed on grounds of&#xD;
sovereign immunity? But see Cohens v. Virginia, </pre><span class="citation"><a href="/scotus/rnd/cohens-v-virginia/"><span class="volume">6</span>&#xD;
<span class="reporter">Wheat.</span> <span class="page">264</span></a></span><pre class="inline"> (1821).)6 And of course precisely the same&#xD;
thing would happen if respondents specifically waived&#xD;
their sovereign-immunity objections in this very case. Yet&#xD;
no one would contend that despite the waiver, sovereign&#xD;
immunity forbade the suit. So also here: If, by reason of&#xD;
Ex parte Young, there has been no violation of sovereign&#xD;
immunity, the prospect of a federal judge’s resolving&#xD;
VOPA’s dispute with respondents does not make it so.&#xD;
   We do not doubt, of course, that there are limits on the&#xD;
Federal Government’s power to affect the internal opera&#xD;
tions of a State. See, e.g., Printz v. United States, 521&#xD;
U. S. 898 (1997) (Congress may not commandeer state&#xD;
officers); Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559, 579 (1911) (Con&#xD;
gress may not dictate a State’s capital). But those limits&#xD;
must be found in some textual provision or structural&#xD;
premise of the Constitution. Additional limits cannot be&#xD;
smuggled in under the Eleventh Amendment by barring a&#xD;
suit in federal court that does not violate the State’s sov&#xD;
ereign immunity. 7&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  6 The dissent agrees that because of the “ ‘constitutional plan,’ ” post,&#xD;
&#xD;
at 8, n. 3 (quoting McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages&#xD;
and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 30 (1990),&#xD;
this Court can adjudicate disputes between state agencies without&#xD;
offending sovereign immunity. But explaining away exceptions to its&#xD;
theory does not advance the ball. It has not demonstrated that sover&#xD;
eign immunity has anything at all to say about federal courts’ adjudi&#xD;
cating interagency disputes.&#xD;
  7 We have no occasion to pass on other questions of federalism lurk&#xD;
&#xD;
ing in this case, such as whether the DD or PAIMI Acts are a proper&#xD;

                     Opinion of the Court&#xD;
&#xD;
                              3&#xD;
  A weightier objection, perhaps, is the relative novelty of&#xD;
this lawsuit. Respondents rightly observe that federal&#xD;
courts have not often encountered lawsuits brought by&#xD;
state agencies against other state officials. That does give&#xD;
us pause. Lack of historical precedent can indicate a&#xD;
constitutional infirmity, see, e.g., Free Enterprise Fund v.&#xD;
Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ____,&#xD;
____ (2010) (slip op., at 25), and our sovereign-immunity&#xD;
decisions have traditionally warned against “ ‘anomalous&#xD;
and unheard-of proceedings or suits,’ ” Alden, 527 U. S., at&#xD;
727 (quoting Hans, 134 U. S., at 18).&#xD;
  Novelty, however, is often the consequence of past con&#xD;
stitutional doubts, but we have no reason to believe that is&#xD;
the case here. In order to invoke the Ex parte Young&#xD;
exception to sovereign immunity, a state agency needs two&#xD;
things: first, a federal right that it possesses against its&#xD;
parent State; and second, authority to sue other state&#xD;
officials to enforce that right, free from any internal veto&#xD;
wielded by the state government. These conditions will&#xD;
rarely coincide—and at least the latter of them cannot&#xD;
exist without the consent of the State that created the&#xD;
agency and defined its powers.            See post, at 3–4&#xD;
(KENNEDY, J., concurring). We are unaware that the&#xD;
necessary conditions have ever presented themselves&#xD;
except in connection with the DD and PAIMI Acts, and the&#xD;
parties have referred us to no examples.8 Thus, the ap&#xD;
——————&#xD;
exercise of Congress’s enumerated powers. As JUSTICE KENNEDY ob&#xD;
serves, whether the Acts run afoul of some other constitutional pro&#xD;
vision (i.e., besides the Eleventh Amendment) “cannot be permitted&#xD;
to distort the antecedent question of jurisdiction.” Post, at 5 (concur&#xD;
ring opinion).&#xD;
   8 We think greatly exaggerated the dissent’s concern that, “[g]iven the&#xD;
&#xD;
number of state agencies across the country that enjoy independent&#xD;
litigating authority,” today’s decision “could potentially lead to all sorts&#xD;
of litigation in federal courts addressing internal state government&#xD;

role autonomous States play in our federal system, and&#xD;
wary of approving new encroachments on their sover&#xD;
eignty. But we conclude no such encroachment is occa&#xD;
sioned by straightforwardly applying Ex parte Young to&#xD;
allow this suit. It was Virginia law that created VOPA&#xD;
and gave it the power to sue state officials. In that cir&#xD;
cumstance, the Eleventh Amendment presents no obstacle&#xD;
to VOPA’s ability to invoke federal jurisdiction on the&#xD;
same terms as any other litigant.&#xD;

&#xD;
&#xD;
   JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,&#xD;
concurring.&#xD;
   Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), recognized a&#xD;
narrow limitation on state sovereign immunity, permitting&#xD;
railroad stockholders to enjoin enforcement of unconsti&#xD;
tutional rate regulations. That negative injunction was&#xD;
nothing more than the pre-emptive assertion in equity of a&#xD;
defense that would otherwise have been available in the&#xD;
State’s enforcement proceedings at law. Id., at 165–166;&#xD;
see also Harrison, Ex Parte Young, 60 Stan. L. Rev. 989,&#xD;
997–999 (2008).&#xD;
   The Court has expanded the Young exception far beyond&#xD;
its original office in order “to vindicate the federal interest&#xD;
in assuring the supremacy of [federal] law,” Green v.&#xD;
Mansour, 474 U. S. 64, 68 (1985), but not without careful&#xD;
attention in each case to the sovereign interests of the&#xD;
State. See Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of&#xD;
Md., 535 U. S. 635, 649 (2002) (KENNEDY, J., concurring).&#xD;
In Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 (1974), for example,&#xD;
the Court applied the exception to an affirmative prospec&#xD;
tive order but not to equitable restitution, for the latter&#xD;
was too similar to an award of damages against the State.&#xD;

&#xD;
Id., at 668; see Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.&#xD;
Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 103 (1984) (“Under the theory&#xD;
of Young, such a suit [for restitution] would not be one&#xD;
against the State since the federal-law allegation would&#xD;
strip the state officer of his official authority. Neverthe&#xD;
less, retroactive relief was barred by the Eleventh&#xD;
Amendment”). And Pennhurst declined to extend Young&#xD;
to suits alleging a state-law violation, for without the need&#xD;
to ensure the supremacy of federal law there was no justi&#xD;
fication for restricting state sovereignty. 465 U. S., at&#xD;
105–106.&#xD;
   The “straightforward inquiry” of Verizon Md. derives&#xD;
from Edelman and Pennhurst, both of which defined im&#xD;
portant limits on Young in order to respect state sover&#xD;
eignty while still adhering to principles necessary to im&#xD;
plement the Supremacy Clause. As a result, Verizon Md.&#xD;
incorporates the very balancing it might at first seem to&#xD;
reject. Verizon Md. itself was an easy case, for it involved&#xD;
the same kind of preenforcement assertion of a defense&#xD;
that was at issue in Young. But when Young’s application&#xD;
is explored in novel contexts, as in Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene&#xD;
Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261 (1997), and also in this case,&#xD;
the inquiry “proves more complex,” Verizon Md., supra, at&#xD;
648 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).&#xD;
   In this case, in my view, the Virginia Office for Protec&#xD;
tion and Advocacy may rely on Young, despite the some&#xD;
what striking novelty of permitting a state agency to sue&#xD;
officials of the same State in federal court. In the posture&#xD;
of the case as it comes before the Court, it must be as&#xD;
sumed that VOPA has a federal right to the records it&#xD;
seeks, and so the extension of Young would vindicate the&#xD;
Supremacy Clause. To be balanced against this important&#xD;
interest is the need to preserve “the dignity and respect&#xD;
afforded a State, which the immunity is designed to pro&#xD;
tect.” Coeur d’Alene, supra, at 268. Permitting a state&#xD;
agency like VOPA to sue officials of the same State does&#xD;

                    KENNEDY, J., concurring&#xD;
&#xD;
implicate the State’s important sovereign interest in using&#xD;
its own courts to control the distribution of power among&#xD;
its own agents. But the affront to the State’s dignity is&#xD;
diminished to some extent when it is noted that if the&#xD;
State had elected the alternate course of designating a&#xD;
private protection and advocacy system it then would have&#xD;
avoided any risk of internal conflict while still participat&#xD;
ing in the federal program. The availability of that alter&#xD;
nate course does not, in my view, weigh much in favor of&#xD;
the validity of the underlying federal scheme, but the only&#xD;
question here is the reach of the Young exception.&#xD;
   Virginia’s concern that the holding here upsets the&#xD;
federal balance is further mitigated by the various protec&#xD;
tions built into the structure of federal litigation to ensure&#xD;
that state officials do not too often call upon the federal&#xD;
courts to resolve their intramural disputes.&#xD;
   First, and most important, state law must authorize an&#xD;
agency or official to sue another arm of the State. If&#xD;
States do not wish to see their internal conflicts aired in&#xD;
federal court, they need not empower their officers or&#xD;
agencies to sue one another in a federal forum. And if&#xD;
state officers are not by state law empowered to sue, they&#xD;
may invoke federal jurisdiction only in their personal&#xD;
capacities.&#xD;
   Second, to the extent there is some doubt under state&#xD;
law as to an officer’s or agency’s power to sue, or any other&#xD;
state-law issue that may be dispositive, federal courts&#xD;
should abstain under Railroad Comm’n of Tex. v. Pullman&#xD;
Co., 312 U. S. 496 (1941). Pullman recognizes the impor&#xD;
tance of state sovereignty by limiting federal judicial&#xD;
intervention in state affairs to cases where intervention is&#xD;
necessary. If an open question of state-law would resolve&#xD;
a dispute, then federal courts may wait for the resolution&#xD;
of the state-law issue before adjudicating the merits.&#xD;
Likewise, certification of questions of state law to the state&#xD;
courts may pretermit an otherwise sensitive federal con&#xD;

&#xD;
troversy. Lehman Brothers v. Schein, 416 U. S. 386, 391&#xD;
(1974) (Certification “helps build a cooperative judicial&#xD;
federalism”).&#xD;
   Finally, federal law does not often create rights for state&#xD;
officials or agencies to assert against other arms of the&#xD;
State. True, officials may assert that their personal fed&#xD;
eral rights are violated by unlawful state action, for exam&#xD;
ple where the State engages in discriminatory employ&#xD;
ment practices. But the statutory framework in the case&#xD;
now before the Court is unusual in that it vests a state&#xD;
agency itself with federal rights against the State. Stat&#xD;
utes tend to protect the rights of individuals, not officers&#xD;
or agencies, and the Constitution’s rights-creating Clauses&#xD;
protect persons rather than officers. Because the Young&#xD;
exception is available only to those who assert federal&#xD;
violations, the paucity of federal rights vested in govern&#xD;
ment officials makes the scope of the holding here a nar&#xD;
row one.&#xD;
   All this is simply to underscore that the program at&#xD;
issue may present constitutional questions but that the&#xD;
parties do not raise them in this litigation. Virginia does&#xD;
not argue, for example, that Congress exceeded its spend&#xD;
ing power under Article I, §8 by forcing a state that wishes&#xD;
to designate a public agency as its advocacy system to&#xD;
allow intramural suits like the instant one or by requiring&#xD;
that the agency be structured as Congress directs. E.g., 42&#xD;
U. S. C. §15043(a)(2)(G) (system must “be independent of&#xD;
any agency that provides treatment, services, or habilita&#xD;
tion to individuals with developmental disabilities”);&#xD;
§15044(a)(2) (“[N]ot more than 1/3 of the members of the&#xD;
governing board may be appointed by the chief executive&#xD;
officer of the State”). Young—a court-made doctrine based&#xD;
on convenience, fiction, or both—neither implicates nor&#xD;
subsumes these more fundamental concerns regarding the&#xD;

to a general principle that the National Government can&#xD;
condition receipt of funds on the State’s agreement to&#xD;
make far-reaching changes with respect to its governmen&#xD;
tal structure or its basic policies of governance in matters&#xD;
within its special competence. Assuming, as the Court&#xD;
must, that the statutes here are constitutional, the narrow&#xD;
question is whether VOPA may rely on Young to avoid the&#xD;
sovereign immunity bar.&#xD;
  One might doubt whether the constitutional question&#xD;
may be so severed from the Young analysis. The Court&#xD;
wields Young in the name of the Supremacy Clause only to&#xD;
vindicate important federal rights. Perhaps this Court&#xD;
should not extend the fiction in the name of claims that&#xD;
may rest on unconstitutional foundations. This concern is&#xD;
misplaced. The canon of constitutional avoidance directs&#xD;
courts to prefer the interpretation of a statute that pre&#xD;
serves its validity, but the specter of a statute’s unconsti&#xD;
tutionality cannot be permitted to distort the antecedent&#xD;
question of jurisdiction. Courts interpret and evaluate a&#xD;
statute only after confirming their authority to adjudicate&#xD;
the case before them. To decline to adjudicate a federal&#xD;
right for fear of its potential unconstitutionality is in effect&#xD;
to invalidate the right in the quest to save it. The Court&#xD;
should not permit the commission of acts that violate a&#xD;
federal right on the mere suspicion that Congress acted&#xD;
beyond its authority. Because the suit must be assumed&#xD;
to vindicate the Supremacy Clause and poses no serious&#xD;
affront to state sovereignty in light of the options available&#xD;
to the State under the program, it may proceed.&#xD;
  With these observations, I join the Court’s opinion.&#xD;

&#xD;
   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE ALITO&#xD;
joins, dissenting.&#xD;
   Today the Court holds that a state agency may sue&#xD;
officials acting on behalf of the State in federal court. This&#xD;
has never happened before. In order to reach this unset&#xD;
tling result, the Court extends the fiction of Ex parte&#xD;
Young—what we have called an “empty formalism”—well&#xD;
beyond the circumstances of that case. Because I cannot&#xD;
subscribe to such a substantial and novel expansion of&#xD;
what we have also called “a narrow exception” to a State’s&#xD;
sovereign immunity, I respectfully dissent.&#xD;

Eleventh Amendment, “[a]n integral component of that&#xD;
residuary and inviolable sovereignty” is the States’ “im&#xD;
munity from private suits.” Federal Maritime Comm’n v.&#xD;

sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual&#xD;
without its consent’ ” (quoting The Federalist No. 81 (A.&#xD;
Hamilton))). “The preeminent purpose of state sovereign&#xD;
immunity is to accord States the dignity that is consistent&#xD;
with their status as sovereign entities.” Federal Maritime&#xD;
Comm’n, supra, at 760. Accordingly, any time a State is&#xD;
haled into federal court against its will, “the dignity and&#xD;
respect afforded [that] State, which [sovereign] immunity&#xD;
is designed to protect, are placed in jeopardy.” Idaho v.&#xD;
Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 268 (1997).&#xD;
The immunity does not turn on whether relief will be&#xD;
awarded; “[t]he Eleventh Amendment is concerned not&#xD;
only with the States’ ability to withstand suit, but with&#xD;
their privilege not to be sued.” Puerto Rico Aqueduct and&#xD;
Sewer Authority v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139,&#xD;
147, n. 5 (1993). See Federal Maritime Comm’n, supra, at&#xD;
769 (“the primary function of sovereign immunity is not to&#xD;
protect state treasuries, but to afford the States the dig&#xD;
nity and respect due sovereign entities” (citation omitted)).&#xD;
  Because of the key role state sovereign immunity plays&#xD;
in our federal system, the Court has recognized only a few&#xD;
exceptions to that immunity. The sole one relevant here is&#xD;
the “narrow exception,” Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,&#xD;
517 U. S. 44, 76 (1996), established by our decision in Ex&#xD;
parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908). In Ex parte Young, the&#xD;
Court held that private litigants could seek an injunction&#xD;
in federal court against a state official, prohibiting him&#xD;
from enforcing a state law claimed to violate the Federal&#xD;
Constitution. See id., at 159–168. As we have often ob&#xD;
served, Ex parte Young rests on the “obvious fiction,”&#xD;
Coeur d’Alene Tribe, supra, at 270, that such a suit is not&#xD;
really against the State, but rather against an individual&#xD;
who has been “stripped of his official or representative&#xD;
character” because of his unlawful conduct, Ex parte&#xD;

Young, supra, at 159–160.1&#xD;
  While we have consistently acknowledged the important&#xD;
role Ex parte Young plays in “promot[ing] the vindication&#xD;
of federal rights,” we have been cautious not to give that&#xD;
decision “an expansive interpretation.” Pennhurst State&#xD;
School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 105, 102&#xD;
(1984). Indeed, the history of our Ex parte Young juris&#xD;
prudence has largely been focused on ensuring that this&#xD;
narrow exception is “narrowly construed,” 465 U. S., at&#xD;
114, n. 25. We have, for example, held that the fiction of&#xD;
Ex parte Young does not extend to suits where the plaintiff&#xD;
seeks retroactive relief, Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651,&#xD;
678 (1974); where the claimed violations are based on&#xD;
state law, Pennhurst, supra, at 106; where the federal law&#xD;
violation is no longer “ongoing,” Green v. Mansour, 474&#xD;
U. S. 64, 71 (1985); “where Congress has prescribed a&#xD;
detailed remedial scheme for the enforcement against a&#xD;
State” of the claimed federal right, Seminole Tribe, supra,&#xD;
at 74; and where “special sovereignty interests” are impli&#xD;
cated, Coeur d’Alene Tribe, supra, at 281.&#xD;
  We recently stated that when “determining whether the&#xD;
doctrine of Ex parte Young avoids an Eleventh Amend&#xD;
ment bar to suit, a court need only conduct a straightfor&#xD;
ward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an&#xD;
ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly&#xD;
characterized as prospective.” Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public&#xD;
Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 645 (2002) (internal&#xD;
quotation marks omitted). But not every plaintiff who&#xD;
complies with these prerequisites will be able to bring suit&#xD;
under Ex parte Young. Indeed, in Verizon itself the Court&#xD;
went beyond its so-called straightforward inquiry in con&#xD;

   1 Ex parte Young also rests on the “well-recognized irony that an offi&#xD;
&#xD;
cial’s unconstitutional conduct constitutes state action under the&#xD;
Fourteenth Amendment but not the Eleventh Amendment.” Pennhurst&#xD;

sidering whether Ex parte Young applied. After deciding&#xD;
the plaintiffs “clearly satisfie[d]” the “straightforward&#xD;
inquiry,” the Court went on to examine whether Congress&#xD;
had created a detailed remedial scheme like the one in&#xD;
Seminole Tribe. 535 U. S., at 645, 647–648 (internal&#xD;
quotation marks omitted). Only after determining that&#xD;
Congress had not done so did the Court conclude that the&#xD;
suit could go forward under Ex parte Young.&#xD;
  If Verizon’s formulation set forth the only requirements&#xD;
for bringing an action under Ex parte Young, two of our&#xD;
recent precedents were wrongly decided. In Seminole&#xD;
Tribe, the Court acknowledged that it had often “found&#xD;
federal jurisdiction over a suit against a state official when&#xD;
that suit seeks only prospective injunctive relief in order&#xD;
to end a continuing violation of federal law.” 517 U. S., at&#xD;
73 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court held,&#xD;
however, that the “situation presented” there was “suffi&#xD;
ciently different from that giving rise to the traditional Ex&#xD;
parte Young action so as to preclude the availability of&#xD;
that doctrine.” Ibid.2&#xD;
  In Coeur d’Alene Tribe, the Court recognized that an&#xD;
“allegation of an ongoing violation of federal law where the&#xD;
requested relief is prospective is ordinarily sufficient to&#xD;
invoke the Young fiction.” 521 U. S., at 281 (emphasis&#xD;
added). The Court held, however, that the action could&#xD;
not proceed under Ex parte Young because it implicated&#xD;
“special sovereignty interests”—in that case, the State’s&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  2 While I agree that in Seminole Tribe “we refused to permit suit to&#xD;
&#xD;
proceed” under Ex parte Young because Congress “had foreclosed&#xD;
recourse to the doctrine,” ante, at 7, n. 3, that simply confirms my point&#xD;
that the availability of Young depends on more than just whether&#xD;
Verizon’s prescribed inquiry is satisfied. In short, Seminole Tribe&#xD;
makes clear that a plaintiff who files a “complaint alleg[ing] an ongoing&#xD;
violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as&#xD;
prospective,” Verizon, 535 U. S., at 645 (internal quotation marks&#xD;
omitted), may nonetheless be barred from pursuing an action under&#xD;
Young.&#xD;

property rights in certain submerged lands. 521 U. S., at&#xD;
281–283.&#xD;
  As we explained in Papasan v. Allain, 478 U. S. 265&#xD;
(1986), there are “certain types of cases that formally meet&#xD;
the Young requirements of a state official acting inconsis&#xD;
tently with federal law but that stretch that case too far&#xD;
and would upset the balance of federal and state interests&#xD;
that it embodies.” Id., at 277. This is one of those cases.&#xD;
  In refusing to extend Ex parte Young to claims that&#xD;
involve “special sovereignty interests,” the Court in Coeur&#xD;
d’Alene Tribe warned against a rote application of the Ex&#xD;
parte Young fiction:&#xD;
        “To interpret Young to permit a federal-court action&#xD;
    to proceed in every case where prospective declaratory&#xD;
    and injunctive relief is sought against an officer,&#xD;
    named in his individual capacity, would be to adhere&#xD;
    to an empty formalism and to undermine the principle&#xD;
    . . . that Eleventh Amendment immunity represents a&#xD;
    real limitation on a federal court’s federal-question ju&#xD;
    risdiction. The real interests served by the Eleventh&#xD;
    Amendment are not to be sacrificed to elementary me&#xD;
    chanics of captions and pleading. Application of the&#xD;
    Young exception must reflect a proper understanding&#xD;
    of its role in our federal system and respect for state&#xD;
    courts instead of a reflexive reliance on an obvious fic&#xD;
    tion.” 521 U. S., at 270.&#xD;
                              B&#xD;
   It is undisputed that petitioner’s complaint alleges an&#xD;
ongoing violation of federal law by a state official and&#xD;
seeks only prospective relief. If this were a “traditional Ex&#xD;
parte Young action,” Seminole Tribe, supra, at 73, peti&#xD;
tioner might very well be able to pursue its claims under&#xD;
that case. This, however, is anything but a traditional&#xD;
case—and petitioner is anything but a typical Ex parte&#xD;
Young plaintiff.&#xD;

&#xD;
   Unlike the plaintiffs in Ex parte Young—and, for that&#xD;
matter, unlike any other plaintiff that has ever sought to&#xD;
invoke Ex parte Young before this Court—petitioner is a&#xD;
state agency seeking to sue officials of the same State in&#xD;
federal court. The Court is troubled by this novelty, ante&#xD;
at 12–13, but not enough. See Free Enterprise Fund v.&#xD;
Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___,&#xD;
___ (2010) (slip op., at 25) (“Perhaps the most telling indi&#xD;
cation of [a] severe constitutional problem . . . is the lack of&#xD;
historical precedent” (internal quotation marks omitted));&#xD;
cf. Alden, 527 U. S., at 743–745; Printz v. United States,&#xD;
521 U. S. 898, 905–910, 918, 925 (1997). This is especially&#xD;
true in light of the “presumption” we articulated more&#xD;
than 120 years ago in Hans v. Louisiana, that States are&#xD;
immune from suits that would have been “anomalous and&#xD;
unheard of when the Constitution was adopted.” Hans,&#xD;
134 U. S., at 18; see also Alden, supra, at 727 (invoking&#xD;
presumption).&#xD;
   Accordingly, when determining whether to lift the bar of&#xD;
sovereign immunity, we have “attribute[d] great signifi&#xD;
cance” to the absence of analogous suits “at the time of the&#xD;
founding or for many years thereafter.” Federal Maritime&#xD;
Comm’n, 535 U. S., at 755. This sort of suit was not only&#xD;
anomalous and unheard of at the time of the founding; it&#xD;
was anomalous and unheard of yesterday. The Hans&#xD;
presumption applies here with full force.&#xD;
   The Court speculates that these suits have not previ&#xD;
ously arisen because the necessary conditions—state&#xD;
agencies pursuing a federal right free of internal state&#xD;
veto—are themselves novel. See ante, at 12; see also ante,&#xD;
at 3–4 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Even if true, that sim&#xD;
ply highlights the fact that this case is not suitable for&#xD;
mere rote application of Ex parte Young.&#xD;
   In addition to its novel character, petitioner’s complaint&#xD;
“conflicts directly with the principles of federalism that&#xD;
underlie the Eleventh Amendment.” Pennhurst, 465 U. S.,&#xD;
                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            7&#xD;
&#xD;
                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
at 106. In Alden, we held that state sovereign immu-&#xD;
nity prohibited Congress from authorizing “private suits&#xD;
against nonconsenting States in their own courts.” 527&#xD;
U. S., at 749. We explained that such power would permit&#xD;
one branch of state government, the “State’s own courts,”&#xD;
“to coerce the other branches of the State” and “to turn the&#xD;
State against itself.” Ibid.&#xD;
  Here the Court goes further: this suit features a state&#xD;
agency on one side, and state executive officials on the&#xD;
other. The objection in Alden was that the Federal Gov&#xD;
ernment could force the State to defend itself before itself.&#xD;
Here extending Young forces the State to defend itself&#xD;
against itself in federal court.&#xD;
  Both sides in this case exercise the sovereign power of&#xD;
the Commonwealth of Virginia. Petitioner claims the title&#xD;
of “The Commonwealth of Virginia” in its complaint, App.&#xD;
10; respondents are state officials acting in an official&#xD;
capacity. Whatever the decision in the litigation, one&#xD;
thing is clear: The Commonwealth will win. And the&#xD;
Commonwealth will lose. Because of today’s holding, a&#xD;
federal judge will resolve which part of the Common&#xD;
wealth will prevail.&#xD;
  Virginia has not consented to such a suit in federal&#xD;
court; rather, petitioner has unilaterally determined that&#xD;
this intramural dispute should be resolved in that forum.&#xD;
This is precisely what sovereign immunity is supposed to&#xD;
guard against. See ante, at 10 (“The specific indignity&#xD;
against which sovereign immunity protects is the insult to&#xD;
a State of being haled into court without its consent”).&#xD;
That indignity is compounded when the State is haled into&#xD;
federal court so that a federal judge can decide an internal&#xD;
state dispute.&#xD;
  The Court is wrong to suggest that Virginia has no&#xD;
sovereign interest in determining where such disputes will&#xD;
be resolved. See ante, at 10–11, and n. 6. It is one thing&#xD;
for a State to decide that its components may sue one&#xD;

&#xD;
another in its own courts (as Virginia did here); it is quite&#xD;
another thing for such a dispute to be resolved in federal&#xD;
court against the State’s wishes. For this reason, the&#xD;
Court’s examples of other suits pitting state entities&#xD;
against one another are inapposite. In each of those hy&#xD;
potheticals, the State consented to having a particular&#xD;
forum resolve its internal conflict. That is not true here.3&#xD;
   In sum, the “special sovereignty interests” implicated&#xD;
here make this case “sufficiently different from that giving&#xD;
rise to the traditional Ex parte Young action so as to pre&#xD;
clude the availability of that doctrine.” Seminole Tribe,&#xD;
517 U. S., at 73. I would cling to reality and not extend&#xD;
the fiction of Ex parte Young to cover petitioner’s suit.&#xD;
                             II&#xD;
   The Court offers several justifications for its expansion&#xD;
of Ex parte Young. None is persuasive.&#xD;
   The Court first contends that whether the Ex parte&#xD;
Young fiction should be applied turns only on the “relief&#xD;
sought” in a case. Ante, at 8–9 (internal quotation marks&#xD;
omitted). The Court is correct that several of our prior&#xD;
cases have focused on the nature of the relief requested.&#xD;
See, e.g., Edelman, 415 U. S., at 664–671. That may well&#xD;
be because “the difference between the type of relief&#xD;
barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that permitted&#xD;
——————&#xD;
  3 Sovereign immunity principles would of course not prohibit this&#xD;
&#xD;
Court from reviewing the federal questions presented by this suit if it&#xD;
had been filed in state court. See ante, at 11. We have held that “it is&#xD;
inherent in the constitutional plan that when a state court takes&#xD;
cognizance of a case, the State assents to appellate review by this Court&#xD;
of the federal issues raised in the case whoever may be the parties to&#xD;
the original suit, whether private persons, or the state itself.” McKes&#xD;
son Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of&#xD;
Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 30 (1990) (internal quotation marks&#xD;
and citation omitted). By contrast, there is nothing “inherent in the&#xD;
constitutional plan” that warrants lower federal courts handling&#xD;
intrastate disputes absent a State’s consent.&#xD;

under Ex parte Young will not in many instances be that&#xD;
between day and night.” Id., at 667. But the Court is&#xD;
wrong to draw a negative implication from those cases and&#xD;
categorically conclude that there can be no other basis for&#xD;
determining whether to extend Ex parte Young’s fiction.&#xD;
   The thrust of the Court’s argument appears to be that,&#xD;
because the relief sought here is no different from that&#xD;
which could be sought in a suit by a private protection and&#xD;
advocacy system, the doctrine of Ex parte Young should&#xD;
also apply to a suit brought by a state system. Ante, at 7–&#xD;
9. But private entities are different from public ones:&#xD;
They are private. When private litigants are involved, the&#xD;
State is not turned against itself.&#xD;
   Contrary to the Court’s suggestion, see ante, at 9, there&#xD;
is indeed a real difference between a suit against the State&#xD;
brought by a private party and one brought by a state&#xD;
agency. It is the difference between eating and cannibal&#xD;
ism; between murder and patricide. While the ultimate&#xD;
results may be the same—a full stomach and a dead&#xD;
body—it is the means of getting there that attracts notice.&#xD;
I would think it more an affront to someone’s dignity to be&#xD;
sued by a brother than to be sued by a stranger. While&#xD;
neither may be welcomed, that does not mean they would&#xD;
be equally received.&#xD;
   The Court also contends that petitioner’s ability to sue&#xD;
state officials in federal court “is a consequence of Vir&#xD;
ginia’s own decision to establish a public [protection and&#xD;
advocacy] system.” Ibid. This cannot mean that Virginia&#xD;
has consented to an infringement on its sovereignty. That&#xD;
argument was rejected below, and petitioner did not seek&#xD;
certiorari on that issue. See Virginia v. Reinhard, 565&#xD;
F. 3d 110, 116–118 (CA4 2009); Pet. for Cert. i.&#xD;
   Instead the Court claims that “Virginia has only itself to&#xD;
blame”—if it wanted to avoid its current predicament, it&#xD;
could have chosen to establish a private entity instead.&#xD;
Ante, at 9–10, and n. 5; see also ante, at 3 (KENNEDY, J.,&#xD;
10   VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY&#xD;

&#xD;
                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
concurring). But I am aware of no doctrine to the effect&#xD;
that an unconstitutional establishment is insulated from&#xD;
challenge simply because a constitutional alternative is&#xD;
available. And here the public and private systems are&#xD;
not interchangeable alternatives in any event.&#xD;
   The Court’s analysis is also circular; it wrongly assumes&#xD;
Virginia knew in advance the answer to the question&#xD;
presented in this case. Only after concluding that Ex parte&#xD;
Young applies to this arrangement—that for the first time&#xD;
in history a state agency may sue an unwilling State in&#xD;
federal court—can the Court suggest that Virginia know&#xD;
ingly exposed its officers to suit in federal court.&#xD;
   In a similar vein, the Court asserts that because Vir&#xD;
ginia law authorizes petitioner to exercise independent&#xD;
litigating authority, petitioner should be treated the same&#xD;
“as any other litigant.” Ante, at 13. But petitioner is not&#xD;
like any other litigant. While it is true petitioner enjoys&#xD;
some independence from the State’s executive branch, that&#xD;
does not mean petitioner is independent from the State.&#xD;
As noted, petitioner certainly views itself as “The Com&#xD;
monwealth of Virginia,” App. 10, and would presumably&#xD;
invoke sovereign immunity itself if sued. As a matter of&#xD;
sovereign immunity law, it should make no difference how&#xD;
a State chooses to allocate its governmental powers among&#xD;
different state agencies or officials.&#xD;
   The Court is wrong to suggest that simply because&#xD;
petitioner possesses independent litigating authority, it&#xD;
may sue state officials in federal court. See ante, at 13&#xD;
(“the Eleventh Amendment presents no obstacle” since it&#xD;
“was Virginia law that created [petitioner] and gave it the&#xD;
power to sue state officials”). There is more to this case&#xD;
than merely whether petitioner needs the approval of the&#xD;
Attorney General to sue, and the Virginia Code provisions&#xD;
cited by the Court say nothing about actions against the&#xD;
State in federal court.&#xD;
   If independent litigating authority is all that it takes,&#xD;

then scores of state entities now “suddenly possess the&#xD;
authority to pursue Ex parte Young actions against other&#xD;
state officials” in federal court. Reinhard, supra, at 124.&#xD;
There would be no Eleventh Amendment impediment to&#xD;
such suits. Given the number of state agencies across the&#xD;
country that enjoy independent litigating authority, see,&#xD;
e.g., Brief for State of Indiana et al. as Amici Curiae 11–&#xD;
13, the Court’s decision today could potentially lead to all&#xD;
sorts of litigation in federal courts addressing internal&#xD;
state government disputes.&#xD;
   And there is also no reason to think that the Court’s&#xD;
holding is limited to state agency plaintiffs. According to&#xD;
the Court’s basic rationale, state officials who enjoy some&#xD;
level of independence could as a matter of federal law&#xD;
bring suit against other state officials in federal court.&#xD;
Disputes that were formerly resolved in state cabinet&#xD;
rooms may now appear on the dockets of federal courts.&#xD;

  No one questions the continued vitality or importance of&#xD;
the doctrine announced in Ex parte Young. But Ex parte&#xD;
Young was about affording relief to a private party against&#xD;
unconstitutional state action. It was not about resolving&#xD;
a dispute between two different state actors. That is a&#xD;
matter for the State to sort out, not a federal judge.&#xD;
  Our decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419&#xD;
(1793)—permitting States to be sued by private parties in&#xD;
federal court—“created such a shock of surprise” through&#xD;
out the country “that the Eleventh Amendment was at&#xD;
once proposed and adopted.” Principality of Monaco v.&#xD;
Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 325 (1934). It is fair to say that&#xD;
today’s decision will probably not trigger a similar re&#xD;
sponse. But however much their practical functions and&#xD;
prominence may have changed in the past 218 years, the&#xD;
States remain a vital element of our political structure.&#xD;
Sovereign immunity ensures that States retain a stature&#xD;

&#xD;
commensurate with their role under the Constitution.&#xD;
Allowing one part of the State to sue another in federal&#xD;
court, so that a federal judge decides an important dispute&#xD;
between state officials, undermines state sovereignty in&#xD;
an unprecedented and direct way. The fiction of Ex parte&#xD;
Young should not be extended to permit so real an&#xD;
intrusion.&#xD;
   Because I believe the Court’s novel expansion of Ex&#xD;
parte Young is inconsistent with the federal system estab&#xD;
lished by our Constitution, I respectfully dissent.&#xD;
